"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Thomas Samson | AFP | Getty Images    Nasdaq officials say a \"connectivity\" problem was what shut down trading for three hours Thursday, but some cybersecurity experts are concerned that hackers may see an opportunity to attack the markets.  \"This draws attention to a system that we know,\" said Alex McGeorge, a senior security researcher at Immunity Inc. \"Even if this wasn't a malicious attack, this has some redundancy issuesmeaning it is probably ripe for having some other types of security vulnerabilities.\"  The stock exchanges could implement a few key changes to enhance security, he said.  Read more: Cramer: Nasdaq was 'WRONG WRONG WRONG'    The Securities and Exchange Commission is working on new regulations for market technology. Only voluntary standardssome dating back to the 1980sare in place now.  \"Those standards reflect the time in which they were written. ... I think there needs to be an update, especially to address what we know about computer security, how we know attackers operate today,\" McGeorge said.  The exchanges have pushed back against regulation. But after the \"Flash Freeze\" on Thursday, the Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifield seemed more open to the SEC's proposals.  \"When you look at the details of the rules, there's always ways to quibble,\" he told CNBC. \"But the pure spirit of the rules are there, and we think we ought to go further on this concept of defensive driving.\"  Watch: Greifield on the Nasdaq Nightmare  McGeorge, who has been working in cybersecurity for the financial industry since 2008, said that the industry must take a broader view of the expense. While cybersecurity can be a big investment, the costs of an attack are far greater.  For example, he said, \"the PlayStation network that's delivered by Sony a very large network, had significant downtime, months, because of a security breach.\" If the same kind of thing were to happen to the exchanges, \"I don't know if the economy could deal with something like this,\" he added.  Watch: Is Wall Street prepared for a cyberwar?    According to McGeorge, regulators and stock exchanges can take a few specific measures to increase cybersecurity.  For one, financial networks need to be better segregated. Thousands of people and firms need to access critical systems daily. Each person is a point of vulnerability.  \"If I can compromise one of the users of this system, that gives me an avenue to attack the system itself,\" McGeorge said.  Stock exchanges also need more redundancies, or backups, he said. The Nasdaq glitch occurred when the central system for reporting pricesknown as the securities information processor, or SIPwas compromised.  Greifeld told CNBC that the Nasdaq would be open to allowing competitors to set up SIPs of their own. That way if a system goes down, firms would have an alternative source for pricing information.       Five Ways Markets Can Protect Themselves from Hacker   CNBC's Scott Cohn reports that while there is no evidence that hackers caused this week's NASDAQ shutdown, experts are concerned about the cybersecurity of US markets. Hacking America presents five ways to ensure US stock exchanges are more secure.    The SEC should require the financial industry to have third parties test its networks, McGeorge said, adding that he performs such tests for Immunity.  Read more: Yes, you can. Teaching children to hack safely \"Anything that's connected to an exchange has to undergo regular, manual third-party assessment,\" he said. \"Nothing scripted or automated, because ... people willing to go through to this length to attack an exchange are going to doing it manually.\"  To hear more about all five steps the markets can take to protect themselves against cyberattacks, watch the video  By CNBC's Scott Cohn.

"title": "Amgen close to buying Onyx for $125 per share", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   AP    Amgen is close to buying Onyx Pharmaceuticals for $125 per share, or more than $10 billion, in a deal that is expected to be announced as soon as Monday, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.  A deal, which is still being finalized and would require board approval from both companies, would represent the fifth-largest biotechnology deal in history. The proposed takeover would value Onyx at 13 times the company's expected revenues for next year, one of the richest valuations in biotech takeovers, one of the people said.  The people asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. Representatives for Amgen and Onyx could not be immediately reached for comment.  The acquisition of Onyx would give Amgen full rights to Kyprolis, the new multiple myeloma drug that analysts expect to reach annual peak sales in excess of $2 billion.  Amgen would also gain a revenue stream from the liver and kidney cancer drug Nexavar that Onyx shares with Bayer AG, as well as royalty payments on Bayer's much newer colon cancer drug Stivarga and potential future royalties on an experimental breast cancer drug being developed by Pfizer.  A deal in the $10 billion range would be Amgen's biggest since its $16 billion acquisition of Immunex in 2001 that gave it the rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel, which is one of Amgen's most important, biggest-selling products.  It would be by far the biggest deal under CEO Bob Bradway, who took over the top spot in May 2012. He has done a handful of much smaller deals, the biggest to date being a $1.16 billion acquisition of Micromet.  Focus on oncology Onyx shares closed at $116.96 on Friday. Amgen offered to pay $120 per share for the company in June but Onyx said that bid significantly undervalued the company and put itself up for sale.  An Onyx deal would also give Amgen a much higher profile in oncology. Several of its current drugs offer supportive care for cancer patients, such as to treat anemia or decreases in white blood cells caused by chemotherapy.  Another of its newer medicines, Xgeva, helps prevent fractures in patients whose cancers have spread to the bone. Its one product that treats cancer, the colon cancer drug Vectibix, has largely been a disappointment.  Analysts are expecting Onyx revenue to reach $878 million in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Geoffrey Porges, long-time biotech analyst for Sanford Bernstein, projected that an Onyx acquisition would boost Amgen revenue by 5 percent to 6 percent near term, rising to 20 percent by 2021.  He sees Amgen EPS declining by 3 percent to 4 percent in 2014 with the purchase of Onyx, but increasing by 8 percent in 2016 and growing to an increase of 22 percent in 2019.  Two of Amgen's biggest products - the anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen - have been in decline for years, while others are fairly mature at this point.  The New York Times first reported on Saturday that the two companies were near a deal. "

"title": "Japan nuclear operator raises alarm on crisis", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Japan Pool| AFP| Getty Images    The operator of Japan's tsunami-hit nuclear power plant sounded the alarm on the gravity of the deepening crisis of containment at the coastal site on Friday, saying that there are more than 200,000 tons of radioactive water in makeshift tanks vulnerable to leaks, with no reliable way to check on them or anywhere to transfer the water.  The latest disclosures add to a long list of recent accidents, leaks and breakdowns that have underscored grave vulnerabilities at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant site more than two years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami set off meltdowns at three reactors.    They come two weeks after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, promised that his government would take a more active role in the site's cleanup, raising questions over how seriously he has taken that pledge. Mr. Abe's government has continued to push for a restart of the country's nuclear power program, and he heads to the Middle East on Saturday to promote Japanese exports to the region, including nuclear technology.  Mr. Abe also plans to lead Tokyo's delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee's final vote, set for Sept. 7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is one of three finalists competing to host the games. The others are Istanbul and Madrid.       How Japan really feels about nuclear power  Two years after the Fukushima disaster, Japanese residents remain strongly opposed to the restarting of nuclear power capacity. CNBC's Sri Jegarajah traveled to the area filed this report.   Opposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency.  ''The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way,'' said Yoshiko Kira of the opposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month.  ''The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water,'' Ms. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe's office in Tokyo.     More from the New York Times  Tank Has Leaked Tons of Contaminated Water at Japan Nuclear Site Syrian Kurds Find More Than a Refuge in Northern Iraq Lockdown by Government Smothers Day of Planned Protest in Egypt Mr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him.  But it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, to handle.  Tepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the product of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into their breached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one tank had sprung a huge leak.  On Friday, Tepco presented an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,000 tons of that water is stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cylindrical tanks, meant as a temporary repository for the growing amount of radiated water at the complex, used vulnerable rubber sealing and that their ability to withstand radiation was not tested.  The tanks are susceptible to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaizumi, the acting general manager of Tepco's nuclear power division. A nearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi said, and high radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already traveled through the drain to the ocean.   The makeshift tanks also lack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two workers are assigned to checking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said.  The Nuclear Regulation Authority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and monitor Tepco's activities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built vessels. But after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made doing so quickly ''unrealistic.''  A series of pits Tepco dug to store some of the water also began leaking earlier this year, forcing workers to transfer the water into the steel tanks.  Experts have said they suspect that more contaminated water is seeping out from under the melted-down reactors into the groundwater and the Pacific. Elevated levels of radioactive cesium in surrounding waters seem to confirm those suspicions.  Tepco has said those leaks are not directly from beneath the reactors, but from maintenance tunnels that run along the coast and remain contaminated from the early days of the disaster.  But it also acknowledges that the water beneath the reactors is extremely contaminated, and experts say that if it does get into the ocean, it will surpass even the leaks that occurred in the disaster's early days.  ''That prospect scares me,'' Michio Aoyama, a senior scientist in the Oceanography and Geochemistry Research Department at the government-affiliated Meteorological Research Institute, said in an interview this month.  ''It's the ultimate, worst-case scenario,'' Professor Aoyama said.  "

Just spend a minute  to give yourself a quick financial checkup. Review your bank balances.  Pay a bill or two.  Contact your bank, credit card company or lender for a quick check on an issue that kept you awake last night. Read more from TODAY.com:For the love of work: Most would stay on job after lottery winWorried about finances, some parents opt for 'one and done'Find money owed to you from old accounts There may be dozens of financial questions you wish you had answers too. I tackled a few for viewers live on the plaza at The TODAY Show. In our \"Money in a Minute\" segment, I took questions from the audience on topics ranging from retirement savings to college planning. Here are a few of my answerswith a little more information than I could get to in 60 seconds ...  Question: Should your savings be in a 401 as opposed to a college education plan for your kids when saving for college?Kerry, 47, Maine.  Sharon's answer: A 529 plan is a far better option for college savings than a 401 or workplace retirement plan. You should put money for college in an account that is earmarked for college, not in your retirement account. Remember if you rob your 401 to pay for college there won't be any scholarships or financial aid to help you cover your expenses in retirement. Keep your retirement money for yourselfand fund a 529 plan for your child. What's great about a 529 college savings plan is that the after-tax money you invest in this account can be withdrawn tax-free to pay for tuition, room and board, fees and other college-related expenses. Plus, many states will offer you a state tax deduction for your contributions. Find out more about 529 plans at www.savingforcollege.com.   Also, don't feel pressured to foot the entire bill for your child's college education. Parents should view saving forand paying forcollege as a family affair. Your child can apply for scholarships, grants and other financial aid. High school and college students can work while in school and save some of their pay for college, just as you do. Your child may also have to take out loans, but can reduce the overall debt load by choosing a more affordable college. Find out more about saving and paying for college at www.collegeanswer.com.    DNY59 | E+ | Getty Images    Question: I'm in my 30s and I'm afraid I am not putting away enough for retirement. What do I do to make sure I'm on track?Leslie, 31, New Britain, Conn.  Sharon's answer: Starting to save for retirement in your 20s or 30s will put you much further on the path toward being financially secure later in life. Still, figuring out how much to save for retirement at any age can be daunting.   Generally, saving at least 10 to 15 percent of your gross income for retirement is a great place to start. You may need to increase that to 20 percent or more depending on how much money you will ultimately need to meet your expenses in your 60s and beyond. If you have a 401 retirement plan at work, make sure you are contributing at least up to the company's matching contribution. Your company may contribute 50 cents or more for every dollar you contribute to the planthat's free money! Don't miss out! Overall, you can contribute a maximum of $17,500 to a 401 this year. The money that you put into a 401 comes out of your pay before taxes, so you're also lowering your taxable income.  You can also save for retirement on your own through an IRA. Roth IRAs, in particular, are great vehicles for retirement savings. You put in after-tax dollars but can take out the money tax-free after age 59  You can contribute up to $5,500 in a Roth IRA this year.  By CNBC's Sharon Epperson.

"title": "Time for market to start worrying about Septemberyikes!", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Wepix | E+ | Getty Images   August has been rough enough on markets, but navigating what's ahead in September could be more than a little scary.September is historically the worst month for stocks but this year, the calendar is a mine field for markets. From the Federal Reserve's mid-month meeting to German elections, Japanese tax changes and U.S. budget debates, there's a long list of potential catalysts for pain. Add to that the selloff in emerging markets and rising tensions in places like Egypt and Syria.The Dow, on average, has been down about one percent in September, and so far this month, it's down more than 3 percent, its worst monthly performance in more than a year. Depending how September plays out, rates could also be a problem for stocks, with some strategists expecting to see the 10-year Treasury yield touch 3 percent or even higher before the month is over. That in turn could push mortgage rates even higher.   \"In August, the spring has been coiling, and in September the spring explodes,\" said Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. \"What people are kind of doing is taking positions to prepare for next month.\" The first big hurdle for markets is the August employment report, on Sept. 6, a report that could dictate the Fed's decision on whether it will announce a reduction in quantitative easing. Economists are divided on when the Fed will start to pare down QE its $85 billion a month bond purchases but some believe it will be September.\"People are reluctant to take big positions right now. They're more likely to lighten more risk,\" Chandler said. \"Take your summer vacation because after Labor Day, it ends very quickly.\"But September will also bring clarity to an issue of major concern to the markets for the past several months, and that is when exactly the Fed will begin slowing its bond purchases, something it has said it hopes to do by year end. The Fed meets Sept. 17, 18, so volatility is expected to increase around that event.\"The main source of uncertainty since May has been is the Fed going to taper,\" said Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank chief global strategist and head of asset allocation. \"Uncertainty should be resolved. We think they're going to do it. You're going to see some uncertainty leaving.\"September markets also have history against them, with the Dow down 60 percent of the time since 1950. \"September is usually not a good month for equities so there are the seasonal issues. Given the volatility in the first half, net net September is not going to be great, but October, November and December should be good,\" he said.Fed Ahead Bond yields have been moving higher ahead of the Fed's September meeting, and just as there is disagreement in the market about when the Fed will taper, there's a range of opinions on how much it will reduce its bond purchases. Fed officials have said they would like to begin cutting back on purchases before year end and complete bond buying by the middle of next year.\"I suspect that we're going to grind a little bit lower from these levels into the September employment report,\" said Ian Lyngen, senior Treasury strategist at CRT Capital. \"All the anecdotes suggest we'll get an at trend or slightly better-than-trend employment report. Then we'll commence the process of pricing in a tapering down, and that will push 10-year yields back to or above 3 percent. That's predicated on the fact that nonfarm payrolls are strong enough and no one can predict that number.\" The 10-year yield was at 2.82 percent Friday, off its high yield of the week.Lyngen expects to see the Fed cut back $5 billion of its $40 billion in monthly mortgage purchases, and $10 billion from its Treasury purchases. Others expect the Fed to pare back as little as $10 billion in total and as much as $25 billion in the first move to cut back. \"We do think they are going to start tapering,\" said Bruce Kasman, chief economist at J.P. Morgan. \"This is going to be a slow process. There's still an open question of whether they do it symmetrically, pulling down Treasury and MBS  equally. We think it could be only Treasurys.\" Kasman expects the Fed to cut out $15 billion to $25 billion in Treasury purchases in the first round.Kasman said the Fed will also be looking at its 2016 forecast at the September meeting, an event that in itself could bring some volatility to rates. \"We think we'll see them forecasting an economy that's close to full employment at the end of 2016,\" he said.The market, however, is not forecasting normalized short-term rates by then which would be more likely 4.25 to 4.5 percent, if the economy is at full employment, said Chadha. \"The market pricing of the Fed funds rate is like 75 or 100 basis points by March, 2016, and that would be basically off by 350 basis points. That is a huge challenge. That's one of the reasons I believe there will be this volatility,\" he said.Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds a briefing after the September Fed meeting, his second to last post-FOMC briefing before his expected retirement at year end. The market focus on his replacement has already added volatility. Traders say an appointment of former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers would mean higher rates and be a minus for stocks since he is seen as less dovish than Fed insider Vice Chair Janet Yellen.\"It's one of the most ferocious fights I've seen in my career. I think people at the Fed adore Janet Yellen and they have great respect for her intellect, and they're rooting for her, but Barack Obama has been through the wars with Larry Summers and he's comfortable with Larry Summers,\" said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research. \" I think there will be a calculation at the White House soon that a confirmation hearing on Larry Summers would be a train wreck.\"The White House is already gearing up for a battle with House Republicans on the budget this fall. \"Yellen would sail through. Does the White House want another big fight by nominating Summers and angering Democrats? I think the prospect of a really ugly conformation fight could tip the balance in favor of Yellen,\" he said.Budget BattlingKasman said that September is just the beginning of an active several months, since it is likely the showdown in Congress, comes not with a budget resolution to fund the government by the end of September but with a debt ceiling debate in November. \"The odds favor an increase in the debt ceiling, but it could take a crisis mentality for that to happen,\" said Valliere. \"I just think we'll come right to the precipice. There will be a lot of anxiety but at the end of the day, they'll raise the debt ceiling. The bottom line is even more fiscal restraint is coming before the end of the year. It's a headwind for the economy but not a huge one. It will keep growth a little lower than it would have been.\"Valliere said Republicans do not want to get blamed for shutting down the government so he expects to see a budget compromise in September that keeps the government funded until December. This past week, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, said he plans to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September by passing a short-term budget bill that maintains the automatic sequester budget cuts.\"Right now I've talked to an awful lot of smart people and they can't figure out how this is going to play out in December. There's a chance the debt ceiling doesn't need to be taken on until later because Treasury receipts look great,\" Valliere said. It's likely there will be a continuation of the sequester, or automatic spending cuts, in the amount of $100 billion for next year, he added.\"The hard-core conservatives in the House will insist upon new concessions in order for their votes to boost the debt ceiling. That could mean at least another year of sequester,\" he said. \"The idea they are going to de-fund Obamacare I think the markets will look past that and look past the shutdown threat. The registration period starts October 1 and I think that it will be funded.\"There will also be uncertainty surrounding the beginning of registration for coverage under Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans have been unsuccessfully proposing bills to kill it. \"The registration period begins October 1, and I think it will be funded,\" said Valliere.Around the GlobeThe German election Sept. 22 has been getting a lot of focus in the foreign exchange market even though a coalition backing Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to win. \"It's not about what's happening in the German election,\" said Chandler. \"What's key is that the election has led to pent up problems they don't want to address until after the German election\" Greece being one of them.Greece's bailout became an issue for Merkel this past week, when her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder said at a rally of his opposition Social Democrats that the governing coalition tried to hide the fact that another Greek bailout is necessary and that \"Germany will have to pay for a Europe not as steady on its legs as we are.\"\"People believe that when the German election is over, the German government can turn its attention to Europe in a more free way,\" Kasman said. \"People are pointing to the election as a pivot point for European policy going forward.\"Investors are also watching Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised to decide in September on whether to raise the consumpution tax by three points to 8 percent, which could slow the economy. The increase would be the first of two that would take it to 10 percent by 2015, and the question is what other structural changes Abe's government would propose.\"I think the consumption tax is going to go,\" said Kasman. \"We're hopeful but not confident that we see a corporate tax cut that hopefully softens the blow by about a half.\"Investors are also watching China to see if it is making a turn, after signs of improvement in manufacturing data. \"We see some signs that things are stabilizing and some signs that policy makers are doing things to stop growth from falling further,\" said Kasman.

"title": "Crowdsourcing to save historic Ford Model T plant", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Source: Ford Motor Company  In 1914 after Ford announced it was raising worker's pay, thousands swamped the Highland Park plant to apply for jobs.   It may be one of the most important sites in automotive historythe home of the first moving assembly line and the place where workers first were offered $5-a-day wagesbut today, there are few signs to show the significance of the old Ford plant in the struggling Detroit suburb Highland Park beyond the Model T name on an adjacent shopping center.  That could change if a Motor City community and economic development group has its way. The Woodward Avenue Action Association, known as WA3, is launching a new crowdsource fundraiser intended to not only save the historic factory but possibly help turn it into a tourist and learning center, which is among the options under study for the building's future.  WA3's new crowdsourcing campaign is an initially modest one. The group needs $550,000 to acquire several of the remaining buildings on the property. It has already received more than $400,000 in grants and now hopes to raise another $125,000 to secure the purchase.   Eventually, organizers say, they will need still more cash to begin restoration and renovation.  Designed by legendary architect Albert Kahn and once known as the Crystal Palace because of its large windows and abundant natural light, the Highland Park Assembly Plant was actually the third Ford Motor factory and the second to produce the Model T. But with huge demand for his \"Tin Lizzie,\" Henry Ford desperately needed to increase production.    He also needed to ensure a reliable source of labor at a time when workers routinely quit because of the grueling demands of the automotive assembly line. That led the industry pioneer to begin offering $5-a-day wages. But Ford had another motive in mind. It also created a new class of increasingly affluent customers who he rightly assumed would also buy the Model T rather than taking the streetcar to work.  The factory first opened in 1910 but Ford continued to struggle with booming demand for the little car. He came up with an idea reverse engineered from the slaughterhouses of the Midwest where carcasses where pushed along a conveyor, each worker hacking off a specific slice of meat. Highland Park began pulling partially assembled Model T bodies along a conveyorinitially by ropeworkers at each station assigned to complete a specific task.   The move helped Ford steadily reduce production costs, dropping the price of the flivver from $800, when it was first introduced, to just $300 by the end of its run.       Ford to close all manufacturing in Australia by 2016  Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford, tells CNBC that the company makes relatively few vehicles in Australia but it will continue to have a \"tremendous presence\" in the country.    The plant's taxes and jobs helped turn the surrounding community into one of the most affluent in the country, but despite its original breakthroughs, the multistory plant grew increasingly outdated and what was once described as \"the factory that changed the world\" was largely abandoned by the late 1920s as Ford Motor opened its even more massive factory complex along Detroit's Rouge River.  Some component and tractor assembly operations continued for a while but the plant has largely been abandoned, with some portions surviving as a company storage depot, and a section as a clothing warehouse. The surrounding suburb has also faded away and is now under emergency financial management.    Despite being added to the National Historic Landmark registry in 1978, there have been concerns the old Model T plant could suffer the same fate as so many other once-prosperous Detroit factoriessuch as the Packard plant a few miles away that has been steadily collapsing, the prospects of saving it growing increasingly dim.  The \"$5 A Day\" campaign has a deadline of Sept. 19 to complete the initial financing package. It could prove especially appropriate as that deadline comes just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the moving assembly line which, a statement from Ford noted, began operating on Oct. 7, 1913, \"creating and defining the industrial age.\" Those who want to donate to the $5 A Day campaign can call 248-288-2004 or visit www.woodwardavenue.org.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "      Tesla millionaires? Friday, 23 Aug 2013 | 2:53 PM ET  CNBC's Phil LeBeau reports the latest on Tesla's safety concerns; and Patrick Hop, Berkeley student, shares why he poured his life savings into Tesla when shares were selling for $32.   Patrick Hop admits that everyone told him he shouldn't do it.  A year later, he's glad he ignored their warnings.  The 22-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley invested $30,000 into Tesla stock a year ago and has parlayed it into an investment worth approximately $250,000 today.   \"I was always preaching to my friends, 'Tesla's gonna be huge' and my friends thought I was crazy,\" said Hop. \"Now my friends are surprised this has actually worked.\"  Officially, Hop's gains are all on paper. But that paper keeps going up in value. On Friday, Tesla shares climbed above $160 for the first time evermeaning the stock is up more than 400 percent in the past year. What's Tesla stock doing now?    Letting it ride on TSLA  Hop, made in his initial investment in Tesla a year ago when the stock was trading at $32. When Tesla stock took off, Hop went along for the ride. When it soared to $115, he dumped the stock. But instead of pocketing a huge profit, he reinvested the money into Tesla call options that expire in January 2015 with a strike price of $130.  \"I figure it wasn't that risky going into those options,\" said Hop. \"And I'll probably dump those options in the next month or two.\"  When it's all said and done, it remains to be seen exactly how much of a profit Hop will make off his initial investment. Still, the college student who hopes to someday start up his own company thinks his strategy of investing heavily in one company was the right thing to do.  After all, Hop considers himself a Tesla expert since he spends extensive time researching and tracking Tesla. \"I'm a big believer in their battery technology.\"          Elon Musk on Tesla's stock price  Shares of Tesla Motors  have been in overdrive, up 353 percent on the year. But could the stock be overvalued? You'll be surprised to hear what CEO Elon Musk thinks. But first, Phil Lebeau asks if the Tesla co-founder considers his company a tech-innovator or an automaker.   Overvalued at $160?  As Tesla shares climb to a new high, it's renewed the debate about whether or not shares of Tesla are overvalued? Or should analysts look at Tesla with the valuation of an auto company or a tech company?  \"We're an automotive tech company,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk told CNBC Thursday on the automakers plant floor in Fremont, Calif. \"I'm not a fan of trying to pump the stock or trying to convince people the stock should be higher, or even convince people the stock should be where it is now. I actually think the value of Tesla right now, the market is being very generous and it's obviously giving us a lot of credit for future execution.\"  Investors are betting that Tesla can expand sales from a projected 21,000 this year to well over 100,000 in three to four years when the company rolls out a lower-priced third-generation car. So there's a lot of execution risk built into the bullish sentiment surrounding Tesla right now.  Nobody is more aware of that risk than Musk.   \"I really think the valuation we've gotten is more than we have any right to deserve honestly,\" said Musk. \"We need to make sure we knock the ball out of the park in the coming years.\"  Betting on Tesla, banking on Musk  When Hop thinks about the risks that could bring Tesla shares, and his sizable investment, crashing down, he worries about earthquakes and Musk stepping down as CEO. \"There's definitely some outlying risks with Tesla and Elon leaving is one of them,\" he said.  Fortunately for Hop, Musk isn't leaving Tesla anytime soon. He's committed to running the company at least through the projected ramp up in production of a third-generation car, which is at least three to four years away.  \"I think I get far too much credit for the success of Tesla,\" said Musk. \"The reason we've been successful is because we have a team of people who work super hard. I'm the one who talks about the results but it's not me who did it really, it's the team here who did it.\"  \"Teslanaires\" hope Musk and his team continue doing what they're doing.  As for Hop, he's yet to buy a Model S. If and when he cashes in his Tesla investment, paying for a $70,000 Model S shouldn't be a problem. \"I'll probably buy one at some point,\" said Hop.

"title": "Egypt widens crackdown and meaning of Islamist", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Gianluigi Guercia | AFP | Getty Images  Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood   Having crushed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian authorities have begun cracking down on other dissenters, sometimes labeling even liberal activists or labor organizers as dangerous Islamists. Ten days ago, the police arrested two left-leaning Canadians one of them a filmmaker specializing in highly un-Islamic movies about sexual politics and implausibly announced that they were members of the Brotherhood, the conservative Islamist group backing the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi. In Suez this month, police and military forces breaking up a steelworkers strike charged that its organizers were part of a Brotherhood plot to destabilize Egypt.  On Saturday, the chief prosecutor ordered an investigation into charges of spying against two prominent activists associated with the progressive April 6 group. When a journalist with a state newspaper spoke publicly about watching a colleague's wrongful killing by a soldier, prosecutors appeared to fabricate a crime to punish the journalist. And the police arrested five employees of the religious Web site Islam Today for the crime of describing the military takeover as a coup, security officials said.        Egypt: is the 'counter-revolution' starting?   Hosni Mubarak was flown to a military hospital, after being released from prison, where he will remain under arrest due to the state of national emergency, reports CNBC's Yousef Gamal El-Din.   Police abuses and politicized prosecutions are hardly new in Egypt, and they did not stop under Mr. Morsi. But since the military takeover last month, some rights activists say, the authorities are acting with a sense of impunity exceeding even the period before the 2011 revolt against Hosni Mubarak.  The government installed by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi has renewed the Mubarak-era state of emergency removing all rights to due process or protections against police abuse. And police officials have pronounced themselves \"vindicated.\" They say the new government's claim that it is battling Islamist violence corroborates what they have been saying all along: that it was Islamists, not the police, who killed protesters before Mr. Mubarak's ouster.  \"What is different is that the police feel for the first time in two and a half years, for the first time since January 2011, that they have the upper hand, and they do not need to fear public accountability or questioning,\" said Heba Morayef, a researcher for Human Rights Watch.  In the more than seven weeks since Mr. Morsi's ouster, security forces have carried out at least three mass shootings at pro-Morsi street protests, killed more than a thousand Morsi supporters and arrested at least as many, actions Ms. Morayef characterized as \"massive police abuse on an unprecedented scale.\" But even beyond the Islamists, she said, \"anyone who questions the police right now is a traitor, and that is a protection that they did not have even in 2010,\" when public criticism was tolerated and at least a few complaints were investigated.  Prosecutors had already begun investigating Mohamed ElBaradei, the liberal former United Nations diplomat, for \"betraying the public trust.\"  President Obama has said the new government is on a \"dangerous path\" marked by \"arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsi's associations and supporters\" and \"violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more.\"  Warning that \"our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back,\" the president canceled a planned joint military exercise. He pledged a review of the $1.3 billion a year in military aid to Egypt, and the State Department took steps to hold back some of the roughly $200 million in nonmilitary aid. But mindful of Egypt's importance in the region, he stopped short of declaring the takeover an illegal \"coup\" or cutting off the aid, instead urging an early return to democracy.   Officials of the new government insist they are committed to establishing the rule of law, as soon as they overcome what they describe as the mortal threat to Egypt of violence by the Brotherhood and other Islamist supporters of Mr. Morsi.  The police appear to be rounding up Brotherhood members on the basis of their affiliation, without other publicly known evidence of crimes. Mr. Morsi is being held incommunicado at an undisclosed location. But government spokesmen insist that every individual, including Mr. Morsi, will be tried by a court and released if acquitted.  \"It is up to the courts,\" Nabil Fahmy, the interim foreign minister, said in a recent interview. All will be handled \"in accordance with the rule of law,\" he said.  But some of the recent charges, like those against the two Canadians, strain credibility. Tarek Loubani, a Canadian physician with Palestinian roots and a history as a liberal and pro-Palestinian activist, was in Egypt on his way to the Gaza Strip to provide training to Palestinian doctors. John Greyson, a liberal Toronto filmmaker whose work often focuses on cosmopolitan sexual themes, was with him, documenting the trip for a possible movie. A lawyer for the two said they were stopped at a checkpoint near a street battle, trying to walk back to their hotel after the 7 p.m. curfew.  \"They were just in the wrong place at very much the wrong time,\" the lawyer, Khaled El-Shalakany, said Saturday.  The exact circumstances of their arrest were unclear. In a public statement, Egyptian prosecutors accused them of \"participating with members of the Muslim Brotherhood\" in an armed assault on a police station and \"taking part in bloody crimes of violence.\" Prosecutors told reporters at the time that the police had detained 240 Brotherhood \"members,\" including two Canadians.   At the Suez steel plant, workers started a sit-in several weeks ago over compensation, health care and the firing of about a dozen employees. On Aug. 12, state news media reported that the Egyptian military had tried to force an end to the strike, arresting two of its leaders. \"They picked the ones with beards!\" a bystander shouts in a video of the arrests.  An army statement at the time used unmistakable coded language to blame the Islamists, charging that \"infiltrating elements\" who were \"exploiters of religion\" were trying to poison the workers' meetings \"in the name of religion.\"  A state-run newspaper quoted the interim labor minister, Kamal Abu Eita, saying that security forces had found Brotherhood members from another factory involved in the strike. A privately owned newspaper supporting the military takeover, Youm El Saba, quoted Mr. Eita blaming the Brotherhood for inciting strikes in several cities.  Among some supporters of the new government, \"Islamist\" has become a popular indictment. After Mr. Obama criticized Egypt's crackdown on the Islamists, Tahani el-Gebali, a former judge close to the military, publicly accused him of having ties to the Brotherhood, claiming his Kenyan half brother directed investments for the group.  The activists with the April 6 group being investigated for spying, Asmaa Mahfouz and Esraa Abdel Fattah, were associated with the group when it was working in opposition to Mr. Mubarak. State news media reports on Saturday indicated the charges were a revival of old allegations that the group had worked on behalf of Western powers to stir unrest in Egypt. The notion was first floated by Mubarak intelligence agencies and the generals who succeeded him, no evidence has emerged to support the claims, and the group has denied the charges.   More from the New York Times  Other Nations Offer a Lesson to Egypt's Military Leaders  5 Days After Closing Border, Egypt Opens Crossing to Gaza Hosni Mubarak's Path From Presidency to Prison and Beyond The journalist who spoke out about his colleague's killing had been driving with the colleague, Tamer Abdel Raouf, the head of the local office of the official newspaper, Al Ahram, in the delta province of Beheira. When their car was at a checkpoint, soldiers enforcing the 7 p.m. curfew shot and killed Mr. Abdel Raouf.  The authorities have granted journalists a curfew exemption, and Mr. Abdel Raouf was driving a car bearing an official press badge from a meeting with the governor. A military spokesman offered no apology, only condolences, and warned others not to try to speed through checkpoints.  The next day, the journalist who had been in the passenger seat, Hamed al-Barbari, began giving television interviews contradicting the spokesman. Rather than speeding, Mr. Barbari said, his colleague was shot in the head while slowly turning his car in response to a soldier's instructions. \"A foolish act\" by one soldier, said Mr. Barbari, who was injured when the car crashed. About two hours after he spoke, a prosecutor arrested Mr. Barbari in the hospital and placed him in custody for four days, for allegedly possessing an illegal shotgun in the car at the time of the episode.  Prosecutors set a court date to begin investigating a citizen complaint against Mr. ElBaradei after he quit as vice president to protest the police violence against the Islamists.   Last week, a prosecutor even opened an investigation into some of the young organizers behind the protests calling for the military to remove Mr. Morsi. The prosecutor was weighing a complaint of \"disturbing the public order\" because they criticized the release from prison of Mr. Mubarak.  Such a case would be an attack on the new government's first supporters. Prosecutors have not yet begun a full investigation of the complaint and could still set it aside. \"It is ridiculous,\" said Mai Wahba, a leader of the group.  "

"title": "Obama weighs up options after Syria gas attack", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Getty Images    President Barack Obama and his top military and national security advisers hashed out options on Saturday for responding to the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria amid \"increasing signs\" that the government used poison gas against civilians. Obama spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron, a top U.S. ally, and agreed that chemical weapon use by Syrian President Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces would merit a \"serious response,\" a spokesperson for the prime minister said in a statement. Syrian opposition accounts that between 500 and well over 1,000 civilians were killed this week by gas in munitions fired by pro-government forces, and video footage of victims' bodies, have stoked demands abroad for a robust, U.S.-led response after 2 1/2 years of international inaction on Syria's conflict. Syria sought to avert blame by saying its soldiers had found chemical weapons in rebel tunnels.        Did Syria cross red line?  NBC's Steve Handelsman reports critics in Washington are complaining that President Obama's delay of any U.S. military response is giving Syria a green light to use weapons again. Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, Huffington Post; Avik Roy, Manhattan Institute; and Mark Simone, WOR radio talk show host, share their opinions on what they want President Obama to do.    Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria's civil war, but reports of the killings near Damascus have put pressure on the White House to make good on the president's comment a year ago that chemical weapons would be a \"red line\" for the United States.  The United States is repositioning naval forces in the Mediterranean to give Obama the option for an armed strike.  The White House declined to list what options were discussed on Saturday and said Washington was still gathering details about the attack.  \"In coordination with international partners and mindful of the dozens of contemporaneous witness accounts and record of the symptoms of those killed, the U.S. intelligence community continues to gather facts to ascertain what occurred,\" it said in a statement.  American and European security sources have said U.S. and allied intelligence agencies made a preliminary assessment that chemical weapons were used by Syrian forces in the attack. The United Nations has requested access to the site.  Obama spoke to Cameron after the White House meeting. A spokesperson for the British prime minister said the two men noted increasing signs of Syrian government culpability.  \u007f\"They are both gravely concerned by the attack that took place in Damascus on Wednesday and the increasing signs that this was a significant chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime against its own people,\" the spokesperson said.  \"The fact that President Assad has failed to cooperate with the U.N. suggests that the regime has something to hide.\"  Cameron also spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Harper spoke to French President Franois Hollande. Syria rejects blame  Obama said in a CNN interview broadcast on Friday that chemical weapon use on a large scale would start \"getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.\"  But Americans strongly oppose U.S. intervention in Syria's civil war and believe Washington should stay out of the conflict even if reports that Syria's government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are confirmed, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.  Syrian state television said soldiers found chemical materials on Saturday in tunnels that had been used by rebels, rejecting the blame for carrying out a nerve gas attack.  The state news agency, SANA, said soldiers had \"suffered from cases of suffocation\" when rebels used poison gas \"as a last resort\" after government forces made \"big gains\" against them in the Damascus suburb of Jobar.  The leader of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, Ahmad al-Jarba, and the head of the rebel Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, denied on Saturday that rebels had used chemical weapons.  Jabra said the \"most important cause\" of the attack was the silence and inaction of the international community, especially the West.  Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there was growing consensus in the West that Assad's government was responsible.  \"It's very clear, I think, that the U.S. and the Western governments think that the regime did it,\" he said. \"Whether their response would immediately be military or not, I don't know. I suspect that first they're probably going to push for diplomacy, but probably with a pretty short fuse.\"  In the most authoritative account so far, the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said three hospitals near Damascus had reported 355 deaths in the space of three hours out of about 3,600 admissions with nerve gas-type symptoms.  A senior U.N. official arrived in Damascus to seek access for inspectors to the site of last Wednesday's attack.  Major world powers - including Russia, Assad's main ally which has long blocked U.N.-sponsored intervention against him - have urged the Syrian leader to cooperate with U.N. chemical weapons inspectors already in Damascus to pursue earlier allegations.  But Russia said the rebels were impeding an inquiry and that Assad would have no interest in using poison gas for fear of foreign intervention.  Alexei Pushkov, pro-Kremlin chairman of the international affairs committee in Russia's lower house of parliament, said: \"In London, they are 'convinced' that Assad used chemical weapons, and earlier they were 'convinced' that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It's the same old story.\"        What's the end game for Syria?    Richard Mallinson, chief policy analyst at Energy Aspects, tells CNBC that a confirmation of chemical weapons in Syria would put a lot of pressure on Obama.    'Range of Options'  The list of participants in the White House meeting underscored its importance. They included Vice President Joe Biden, national security adviser Susan Rice, CIA Director John Brennan, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, and Samantha Power, the U.S. representative to the United Nations.  Aides said Secretary of State John Kerry, who is on vacation in Massachusetts, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who is traveling in Asia, both participated remotely.  Administration officials were cautious in describing the content of the discussions and warned against expectations of a decision on Saturday.  \"We have a range of options available, and we are going to act very deliberately so that we're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in Syria,\" a White House official said before the meeting.  \"Once we ascertain the facts, the president will make an informed decision about how to respond,\" a White House official said.  Hagel said on Friday the Pentagon was taking measures to prepare for all options. \"And that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets, to be able to carry out different options - whatever options the president might choose,\" he said without elaborating.  A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. Navy would expand its presence in the Mediterranean to four destroyers from three.  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani weighed in on the issue for the first time, saying chemical weapons had killed people in Syria, its ally. Although Rouhani stopped short of saying who he thought had used the weapons, Iran's Foreign Ministry said evidence pointed to rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  The U.S. Central Command and the Jordanian armed forces were planning to host a meeting of regional defense chiefs from Sunday to Tuesday in Jordan. The group will discuss \"the region's dynamic security environment.\" The meeting was scheduled in June and not called in response to the recent attacks in Syria, a Pentagon spokesman said.  "

Conceptually, VoMBB is about encompassing carrier-grade voice calls over LTE, Wi-Fi and HSPA/HSPA+ networks.  While Wi-Fi is a nifty feature of the network that offloads voice and data traffic of indoor users, its prominence will reduce with the increased adoption of VoHSPA and VoLTE. VoHSPA and VoLTE are expected to gain ground as they will enable high spectrum efficiency, reduce cost per subscriber, and provide richer voice and therefore, will dramatically alter the operations of telecom operators. Given the increasing demand for bandwidth capacity, refarming legacy network spectrum will be one of the trends that will be emerging in the market. However, delay in setting-up LTE ecosystems could hinder the growth of this market.

"title": "Microsoft CEO Ballmer to step down within 12 months", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Getty Images  Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft   Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer shocked the technology world on Friday by announcing he would step down within 12 months, punctuating a tenure marked by the software giant's declining dominance and struggles to keep pace with its competitors.  In a statement, Microsoft said Ballmer would retire \"upon the completion of a process to choose his successor. In the meantime, Ballmer will continue as CEO and will lead Microsoft through the next steps of its transformation to a devices and services company that empowers people for the activities they value most.\"  Market scrutiny will now likely shift to who will be tapped to succeed Ballmer. Despite that uncertainty, investors applauded the news by sending Microsoft's shares surging by more than 7 percent adding a whopping $24 billion to the software company's market capitalization from Thursday's close.         Microsoft's Ballmer to retire in 12 months  Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will retire in 12 months, and the company will consider both internal and external candidates, reports CNBC's Jon Fortt.   The announcement took markets by surprise, and came only a month after the Redmond-based technology behemoth announced a broad reorganization designed to capitalize on the relentless shift toward mobile technology. Ballmer acknowledged the strategic shift, as he complemented the new leadership team. \"There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,\" Ballmer said in a statement.  \"My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our company's transformation to a devices and services company,\" he added. \"We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.\"A 33-year veteran of the software giant, Ballmer once oversaw Microsoft's sales and operations, and played an instrumental role in birthing the X-box, one of the company's most successful product lines.Still, Microsoft's traditional strengths in office software hit rough shoals, mirroring the dramatic slump in personal computer sales. In recent years, its suite of Windows and Microsoft Office products have taken a back seat to mobile applications that provide users with both entertainment and productivity. Sales of its Surface tablets have been comparatively meager, and the company was forced to shave the device's price in order to boost lagging sales. Ballmer succeeded billionaire Bill Gates in 2000, the iconic wunderkind whose knack for technology innovation was rivaled only by deceased Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Much like Apple's current CEO Tim Cook, Ballmer was forced to wrestle with unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, despite a much more flamboyant personal style that made for several viral videos.  Under Ballmer's leadership, Microsoft's stock languished and its rivals most of whom moved rapidly to profit from the explosive growth of smartphones and tablets began separating themselves from the rest of the technology pack. Balmer's ascension to the top suite at Microsoft coincided with the bursting of the Dotcom bubble. As a result, he presided over a 37 percent decline in the company's stock price, relegating Microsoft to among the worst performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index.  Ironically, Gates himself will have a hand in selecting Ballmer's successor. Microsoft said that its board would appoint a special committee to find a new chief, which will include Gates, audit committee chair Chuck Noski and compensation chairman Steve Luczo. The group \"will consider both external and internal candidates.\"  "

"title": "UPDATE 5-CEO Ballmer retires as Microsoft struggles to modernize", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " * Ballmer to retire in next 12 months* Special committee to find new CEO, no obvious candidate* Activist shareholder recently campaigned for change* Ballmer long criticized by Wall StreetSEATTLE/NEW YORK, Aug 23  - Steve Ballmer, a passionate salesman who has been a central figure at Microsoft Corp for more than three decades, unexpectedly announced his retirement as chief executive on Friday, ending a controversial 13-year reign in which the world's largest software company lost its position as the dominant force in computing. The surprise move sent the company's share price up 7 percent, reflecting a widespread view that Ballmer is not the man to reverse the fortunes of a company that remains highly profitable but has failed to navigate the transition to the mobile computing era. Ballmer's planned exit comes just weeks after the company announced a major reorganization and delivered an earnings report that showed across-the-board weakness in the business, including dismal sales of the company's new Surface tablet and a lukewarm reaction to the crucial Windows 8 operating system.Microsoft said it had engaged the executive search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles and would consider both internal and external candidates to succeed Ballmer - underscoring the lack of a succession plan at a company where many talented executives have been squeezed out over the years. Ballmer will stay on for up to a year until a new CEO is found. A close friend and confidant of co-founder Bill Gates since the company's earliest days, the 57-year-old Ballmer formally notified the company two days ago of his intention to retire, according to a regulatory filing. In an interview with the trade publication ZD Net, director John Thompson said the search for a successor had in fact been underway for some time. \"We are well down the path in the search,\" said Thomson, who is leading a search committee that also includes Gates. Still, the timing of the announcement and the lack of a succession plan suggest the recent setbacks may have spurred the company's board to act. Gates remains chairman of the board, which has historically followed his lead. Ballmer himself acknowledged his decision was abrupt. \"There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,\" he wrote in a memo to employees. \"This is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.\" Ballmer has faced criticism from investors for years as rivals led by Apple Inc and Google Inc came to dominate huge new markets in smartphones, tablets, Internet search and cloud computing even as Microsoft remained reliant on the traditional personal computer. Activist investing fund ValueAct Capital Management LP said in April that it had taken a stake in the company and shortly after began agitating for a change in strategy and a clear CEO succession plan. Microsoft, like Apple, has been under pressure from shareholders to hand back more of its cash hoard, which now totals $77 billion. \"This might accelerate more shareholder-friendly capital returns of that cash treasure trove, which would help in the revaluation of the stock to more appropriate levels,\" said Todd Lowenstein at fund firm HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares. There are no obvious candidates to succeed Ballmer at a company that has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history. Ballmer had once indicated that he intended to stay at least until 2017.Ballmer can claim some important successes: revenue tripled during his tenure, profits doubled, and the company scored a big success with the Xbox videogame business. The Windows and Office franchises remain highly profitable, and Microsoft is well-entrenched as a vendor of corporate computing products and services. At the same time, though, repeated forays into mobile phones, tablets and music players have come to grief. The Surface tablet, aimed at the hugely successful iPad, alienated longtime hardware partners even as it failed to generate significant sales, and a phone partnership with Nokia has thus far yielded little for either company. At the same time, the company has lost billions trying to compete with Google in the Internet search business. Some of Microsoft's corporate computing businesses are also under threat from the industry-wide transition to cloud-based services. The recent reorganization was aimed at reshaping Microsoft - once primarily a purveyor of packaged software - into a company focused on devices and services, essentially mimicking Apple. Yet most industry watchers felt it was too little, too late, with some calling on the company to back away from the consumer products sector and focus on serving businesses. In the ZD Net interview, Ballmer rejected that approach. \"Nobody has ever managed to figure out how to build a device for a user that was just enterprise or just consumer,\" he said. \"These core experiences do span 'consumer and enterprise.\"'PASSION AT THE TOP Ballmer, a forceful, often emotional leader, was regarded a great salesman rather than a brilliant technologist. A physically imposing presence with a booming voice, his motivational efforts were the stuff of legend: a clip of a semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing around the stage to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed nearly five million times on YouTube. Yet the antics sometimes acquired an air of desperation as Apple and other rivals produced industry-changing innovations that Microsoft couldn't match. \"That is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers,\" Ballmer laughed in a TV interview after the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007. Five years later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft's overall revenue. A Michigan native, Ballmer studied applied mathematics and economics at Harvard, where he met Gates. Several years later Gates persuaded him to drop out of Stanford Business School to become Microsoft's first commercial manager and the company's 30th employee. To induce him, Gates offered Ballmer part ownership of the company, and when Microsoft incorporated a year later, Ballmer had almost an 8 percent stake. That formed the foundation of his wealth which is now valued at $15 billion by Forbes magazine. Ballmer remains one of the largest holders of Microsoft stock, with about four percent of the company. His net worth, ironically, soared by nearly a billion dollars on Friday as the stock market celebrated his departure. Microsoft shares closed up 7.3 percent at $34.75 on Nasdaq on Friday. "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "      Why Steve Ballmer gets a B-plus as CEO Friday, 23 Aug 2013 | 12:28 PM ET  Over his tenure at the helm of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer tripled revenues and returned almost $200 billion to shareholders, Yale School of Management's Jeffrey Sonnenfeld says.   The candidates outside Microsoft to succeed outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer are impressive, management expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said Friday.  His top pick is T-Mobile CEO John Legere.  Legere, a former executive at Dell and AT&amp;T, is experiencing \"incredible performance,\" Sonnenfeld said on CNBC's \"Fast Money.\"  \"John Legere knows every part of this business. His ad rates are soaring. At T-Mobile, the usage is up dramatically,\" he said. \"And he actually really knows the device business. His relationships with Apple, Samsung and everybody out there is spectacular.\" Two other possibilities were Yahoo's CEO and Facebook's COO.  \"Marissa Mayer should be on everybody's short list. It's incredible what's happening at Yahoo,\" he said. \"And, of course, Sheryl Sandberg is certainly dressed up and ready to go as CEO somewhere, too. So, there's ample, fantastic talent on the outside.\"  Ballmer, who succeeded Bill Gates to take the helm of Microsoft in 2000, announced that he would be leaving the company within the next 12 months.    For his performance, Ballmer eared a \"B-minus\" grade from Sonnenfeld, who is senior associate dean for Executive Programs at the Yale University School of Management.  \"Over that 11 years, he's actually tripled revenues,\" he said. \"It's a $76 billion business. It was a third of that when he stepped in.\"  During Ballmer's tenure, Microsoft returned close to $200 billion to shareholders.  \"Nobody else has given shareholders that much back in dividends and repurchases,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"That's a pretty good record.\"        Step into the Gap  Gap recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of higher same-store sales. Will Gap be the next to fall victim to the teen slump? Stephanie Link and Mike Murphy debate. Joe Saluzzi, Themis Trading, joins to discuss Nasdaq's \"flash freeze.\" And according to Dow Jones quoting sources, Bats Global Markets is in merger talks with Direct Edge.     Sonnenfeld also praised Microsoft for evolving into new areas.  \"They have 75 percent of their revenues now are not coming from those old operating systems,\" he said. \"They've been moving into these new business categories.\"  Even thoughas TheStreet CIO Stephanie Link noted earlierMicrosoft stock is 39 percent lower since Ballmer took over, Sonnenfeld said that share prices weren't everything.  \"Let's think of those new-new thing companies,\" he said. \"The companies that were being celebrated then for their soaring stock performance were, you know, GeoCities and Excite and Lycos and Kozmo and WebVan and HomeGrocer and Netscape, Snap, Lycos, eToys.    \"What's happened to those? They were soaring stock and then they disappeared. This is a company that's built for sustainability, not to be the new-new thing.\"  Sonnenfeld said that there was \"a dependability\" and \"a reliability\" with Microsoft's moves.  But why now?  \"The why now issue, I think, has to do with why would this not been about six, seven weeks ago,\" he said. \"If there was great board disaffection, you would not have let him go through this massive restructuring. What he's done now is the heavy lifting for a successor. He said he wasn't going to see it through, sort of like Moses saying, 'I'm not going to get you to the Promised Land.'\"  By CNBC's Bruno J.

"content": "  Stocks advanced on Friday as a sharp drop in new home sales added to the uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve may begin to reduce its monthly bond purchases.  Microsoft shares surged, giving the tech sector a boost, after the company said CEO Steve Ballmer will retire within 12 months. Facebook, meanwhile, climbed 5 percent to close above $40.          Name Price  Change %Change DJIA   ---   S&amp;P 500   ---   NASDAQ   ---     The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed, helped by a 7 percent surge in Microsoft and 1 percent gains in Verizon and AT&amp;T shares. Travelers and Cisco were among the laggards.  The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also posted gains. The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, fell to near 14. Among S&amp;P sectors, telcos and materials paced the advance while financials and consumer discretionary underperformed.  For the week the Dow fell 0.5 percent, the S&amp;P gained 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq added 1.5 percent. As markets try to position for the September Fed meeting and some other events expected this fall, Rosenblatt Securities' Gordon Charlop said there could be a little more downside. \"I'm not seeing the same kind of aggressiveness from buyers\" looking to get in on the dips, he said. And that could mean markets continue this sideways trend.  A day after the 3-hour Nasdaq trading halt, Nasdaq OMX Group CEO Robert Greifeld told CNBC that the exchange has fixed the technical issues, but could not guarantee there would be no future problems.        To September taper or not to taper?  Vincent Reinhart, Morgan Stanley, provides insight on why the Fed is likely to begin reducing its asset-buying program next month, unless weak employment data are reported, which is not in the forecast.   Focus on Jackson Hole  Markets still have no greater clarity on when the Federal Reserve may begin to curtail its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases following Friday's economic data. Sales of new single-family homes fell 13.4 percent to a 394,000 annual rate in July, their lowest level in nine months.  \"We've had a strong run in housing like we've had in the stock market and some correction was inevitable in the face of the spike in mortgage rates,\" Dan Greenhaus of BTIG said.  Home builder stocks slumped after the data.  On Thursday, global manufacturing data painted a more encouraging picture of the world economy.  With the data mixed, Fed officials speaking with CNBC from the annual central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. also offered few clues as to what the Fed may do at its September meeting.  James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed, meanwhile, told CNBC the central bank should take its time. \"Inflation is running low, you've got mixed data on the economy, so I'd be cautious and I wouldn't want to pre-judge the meeting,\" he said.  Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed president John Williams told CNBC that the Fed's actions will depend on the incoming economic data. \"Any tapering I think we would do would be in gradual steps over time,\" Williams said.         Ballmer retirement sends MSFT shares soaring  Dan Niles, AlphaOne Capital Partners, discusses the jump in Microsoft shares after the announcement CEO Steve Ballmer will retire next year. Niles explains why he is buying some shares now as a short-term play. And CNBC's Jon Fortt shares his thoughts on the timing of Ballmer's departure.   Retail earnings mixed   Turning to earnings reports, Pandora Media shares tumbled after the company warned that earnings for fiscal 2014 would fall below analyst estimates as expenses to buy music rights and expand its sales personnel rise. Retailers were also in focus again with Gap, Ann, Foot Locker and Aeropostale providing a mixed picture of the American consumer.  In financials, Moody's Investors Service warned it might cut the credit ratings of the six biggest U.S. banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo saying the government may be unlikely to bail them out should they face trouble in the future.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "      Twitter's path to IPO? Friday, 23 Aug 2013 | 1:22 PM ET  Since Facebook's IPO in 2012, the Nasdaq has taken 15 tech companies public, reports CNBC's Julia Boorstin. All eyes are on Twitter, Box and Dropbox as the next anticipated IPOs.   One major question after the latest snafu at Nasdaq is how it will affect the exchange's fight for hot initial public offerings. The best analogy is the Facebook IPO debacle, after which the Nasdaq lost ground to the NYSE when it came to wooing IPOs.  Since that IPO, in May 2012, the Nasdaq has taken 15 tech companies public, raising $1.35 billion. In the same period, the NYSE handled 21 tech IPOs, which raised $3.5 billion, or more than twice that of its rival, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ.  \"Any exchange that prides itself on being a technology or technological vanguard, if they have hiccupshow well are they serving clients and potential clients in the future?\" asked Rich Peterson, director of global markets intelligence at S&amp;P Capital IQ.   William Preston of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital told CNBC that the NYSE was already gaining share before the Facebook offering.  \"Nasdaq fumbled one of the highest-profile IPOs ever, and it was so damaging to market sentiment and to CEOs of prospective IPOs that it essentially gave NYSE ammunition for future pitches,\" Preston said. \"Today's trading halt will likely do the same.\"      The NYSE reported that its IPO lead has been accelerating, noting that in the first half of this year it raised four times as much capital from U.S. IPOs as from any other U.S. marketplace, with a record 64 percent of tech offeringsraising 58 percent of capital in the tech sector.  Some of the tech companies choosing the NYSE since Nasdaq bungled Facebook's debut: Trulia, Palo Alto Networks, Workday and Evertec. The last two raised more than $500 million each.  Now all eyes are on the next wave of highly anticipated offerings, expected in the next year. Twitter, storage companies Box and Dropbox, big data cruncher Palantir Technologies, and car service Uber are all expected to file $1 billion-plus IPOs.  But will they head for the Nasdaq to join giants Google, Apple and Facebook, or will that exchange's blunders send them to the NYSE.  \"Nasdaq was the home and the haven for many tech offerings,\" said S&amp;P's Peterson. \"But now, if you look at the post-Facebook period, the NYSE is gaining the bragging rights over its uptown competitor.\"  On CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld how he thinks the trading freeze will impact Nasdaq's IPO business. \"I think people respect that we did handle this process in a proper way,\" Greifeld said. \"We want to get to perfection; we want to get to 100 percent reliability, and we are getting better at that all the time.\"  \"The instances of [trading] problems in the U.S. has actually gone down,\" he said. \"You can't quite get that from the press. The world is getting better. I think people recognize that.\"  We'll see if CEOs recognize that when they pick an exchange for their IPO.  By CNBC's Julia Boorstin.

"content": " Aug 23  - Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd do not have to make public the financial details submitted to a U.S. court during high-profile patent litigation, a federal appeals panel ruled on Friday.The Federal U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington reversed a lower court ruling that ordered the two companies to disclose portions of documents that contain profit and sales information.\"We recognize the importance of protecting the public's interest in judicial proceedings and of facilitating its understanding of those proceedings,\" the three-judge appeals panel decided. \"That interest, however, does not extend to mere curiosity about the parties' confidential information where that information is not central to a decision on the merits.\"Representatives for Apple and Samsung declined to comment.Peter Scheer, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition - an advocacy group that argued in the appeals court to have the information disclosed - said he was disappointed in the outcome for the Apple/Samsung case.However, Scheer said the ruling is not all bad for public access to court records. For instance, the ruling says companies cannot keep information secret in court merely by calling it a trade secret, and judges must scrutinize those secrecy requests, Scheer said.\"If all the cases that come after this one adhere loosely to the legal requirements articulated in this decision,\" Scheer said, \"then those trials will be infinitely more open and transparent than otherwise would have been the case.\"Apple and Samsung have been waging patent litigation across the globe since 2011, climaxing in a high-profile trial last year in San Jose, California. A jury awarded Apple over $1 billion, but U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh later slashed the award and ordered a retrial on some of the damages.In the run-up to trial last year, attorneys for both sides submitted several documents to the court that contained financial details in order to calculate damages. The details were redacted, and Reuters filed motions in the court to unseal the documents.Koh ruled against Apple and Samsung, saying the public's interest in understanding the proceedings outweighed the companies' rights to keep the information secret. However, the appeals court unanimously disagreed.\"While protecting the public's interest in access to the courts, we must remain mindful of the parties' right to access those same courts upon terms which will not unduly harm their competitive interest,\" Judge Sharon Prost wrote.The case in the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al., 12-1600.

"title": "Microsoft, Motorola set for second round of trial over patents", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " SEATTLE, Aug 25  - Microsoft Corp takes on Google's Motorola Mobility unit this week in the second of two landmark trials between the companies that delve into hot disputes over the patents behind smartphone and Internet technology.The jury trial, starting Monday in federal court in Seattle, is set to resolve whether Motorola breached its contract with Microsoft to license on reasonable terms its so-called standard essential patents, covering wireless and video technology used in the Xbox game console.The proceeding comes days after Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announced his retirement. It also follows a complex trial last November that decided what the appropriate fee for Microsoft's use of Motorola-patented technology should be.After five months of deliberation, U.S. District Judge James Robart came down heavily in Microsoft's favor, saying it owed only a fraction of the royalties Motorola had claimed, suggesting the appropriate rate was about $1.8 million, above Microsoft's estimate of $1 million, but well below Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year.Motorola cannot appeal Robart's April ruling until after the jury decides the second phase of the case.In a court filing, Microsoft said it had offered to pay Motorola $6.8 million in past royalties, based on its application of Robart's order. However, Motorola rejected the money, the filing said.In the forthcoming trial, starting with jury selection on Monday, Microsoft will argue that Motorola's initial demand was exorbitant and a clear breach of its agreement to charge reasonable and non-discriminatory terms - commonly referred to as 'RAND' - for technology that is an industry standard.Microsoft and Google declined comment on the trial.After the result of the first trial, Motorola may have an uphill task in persuading a jury that it did not breach its contract. But Microsoft might not be able to recover huge damages, either.\"I think the interesting question is, assuming the court finds that Motorola breached its obligation to offer a RAND license, what is the remedy?\" said Mark Lemley, a Stanford Law School professor who has been following the litigation. \"No court has addressed that issue before.\"In its quest for damages, Microsoft will introduce evidence about how much it had to spend to relocate a facility in Germany as a result of an injunction that Motorola won in Europe, according to court filings. Robart later ordered Motorola not to enforce that injunction, and Microsoft claims it should be reimbursed.Microsoft will also seek legal fees resulting from the injunction fight.The argument between Microsoft and Motorola - and by extension Google, which now owns it - is just one facet of a wide-ranging global patent war surrounding smartphone and Internet technology that has drawn in Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co, Nokia and others.At heart, the companies are arguing over who owns the technology and design features behind smartphones, which are now essentially small computers.More particularly, Microsoft has been locked in a battle with Google to ensure that handset makers using Google's free Android phone operating system pay Microsoft a license fee. Most large handset makers, such as Samsung, LG and HTC , have agreed to pay Microsoft a royalty on Android handsets that Microsoft believes may infringe on its patents. Motorola, which was bought by Google last year for $12.5 billion, is the last big holdout.Robart gave each side 16 hours of trial time to present their case to a jury.The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " NEW YORK, Aug 23  - The vague \"connectivity issue\" that Nasdaq said triggered the outage that paralyzed a large part of the U.S. stock market on Thursday originated as a problem between Nasdaq and rival NYSE Arca, a source familiar with the matter said Friday.Nasdaq said the problem started shortly before midday Thursday and quickly cascaded through its Securities Information Processor, or SIP, the system that receives all traffic on quotes and orders for stocks on the exchange, preventing it from disseminating quotes.The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said brief outages between exchanges occur from time to time but are short-lived.In such instances, traders receive alerts from an exchange that essentially tell them to rout their order flow elsewhere for a period. Most of these episodes, which may occur several times a week, are resolved quickly.Nasdaq did not respond to requests for additional information beyond a statement issued to traders on Friday. A spokesman for NYSE Euronext, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange and its NYSE Arca platform, denied Arca was involved.Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld, in television interviews on Friday, declined to identify the source of the connectivity problem.The precise nature of the breakdown remains unclear.But the outage, first flagged at 11:48 a.m. EDT , quickly spiraled out of control and soon left $5.9 trillion of U.S. equities - more than a third of the U.S. stock market - idle for more than three hours. Shares of three of the five largest companies by market value, Apple Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp, typically also among the most active in any session, were unavailable.COMMUNICATION CRITICIZEDA number of market participants and others criticized Nasdaq's lack of an early public statement on the outage. Nasdaq did not issue a formal press release until late Thursday afternoon, well after the trading day had ended.\"As usual the communication could have been a little bit better. They could improve the communication and the amount of communication,\" said Mark Turner, managing director and head of sales trading at Instinet in New York.Nasdaq CEO Greifeld said the exchange sent messages through its trader alert system and was involved in direct communication with clients.Nasdaq's first responsibility was to assure \"fair and orderly markets,\" Greifeld said on Friday on Fox Business Network, and exchange officials worked first to understand and fix the problem and then to communicate with the securities industry to ensure a smooth restart.\"There was active communication going on,\" Greifeld said.\"It has shown how horrible the crisis management side is. Communication was horrid. There is no backup. So we have to focus on the crisis management side,\" Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer of Pimco, said Friday on CNBC.In the end, even those who criticized Nasdaq for the pace of its communications, agreed the reopening of trading did go well.Trading on Friday transpired with no apparent hiccups. Shares of Nasdaq itself, which fell 3.4 percent once trading resumed on Thursday, gained about 1.2 percent.IN THE EYE OF REGULATORSWhile worst-case outcomes may have been averted, the outage still was among the most serious in a series of recent technological failures to hit the U.S. securities business, including a software issue at the Chicago Board Options Exchange this spring that delayed the start of trading there for half a day.It was also the latest black eye for Nasdaq, which in May agreed to pay $10 million, the largest penalty ever against a stock exchange, to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges over its mishandling of Facebook's initial public offering in 2012.The incident has already drawn the attention of regulators, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White said Thursday she would like to press ahead with new market structure regulations that Nasdaq and other exchanges have resisted.White's predecessor, Mary Schapiro, said Thursday's events are a harsh reminder of the shaky nature of modern markets.\"Events like this contribute to investors' concerns about the stability and integrity of the marketplace,\" Schapiro told Reuters in an interview on Friday. \"I have said many times while I was SEC chairman ... investors understand they can make or lose money when they buy a stock and the fortunes of the company change. What they don't understand and shouldn't have to understand, and shouldn't be subject to, are losses based on whether the market structure is stable.\"Many market participants said it was fortunate the outage occurred during a low-volume summer day.\"We were lucky yesterday,\" said Sal Arnuk, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading. \"If the SIP failure occurred on a 10 billion share day or any high VIX, high volume day in October - where say the Fed changes policy, then I seriously doubt they, or any exchange, would have been able to re-open 2,000-plus stocks. That is a statement to the fact that we have created and allowed and encouraged an overly complex market structure.\" "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "      Getting to the core of Apple Friday, 16 Aug 2013 | 10:12 AM ET  The movie \"Jobs\" opens in theaters today. John Sculley, former Apple CEO, weighs in on its debut and Carl Icahn's involvement in the company.    Former Apple CEO John Sculley says Steve Jobs, unlike Tim Cook, probably would not have taken Carl Icahn's call.  Icahn spoke by phone this week with Cook, and then announced he had taken a large position in the tech company, which has been in the doldrums.    Sculley, who was Apple's chief from 1983 until 1993, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that he thinks Icahn's purchase was to take advantage of an undervalued stock rather than as a long-term investment.    \"I doubt if Steve Jobs would have taken Carl Icahn's call or anyone else who is an activist. I think it's a lot about financial engineering,\" he said. \"The bigger story for Apple is always going to be growth and it's going to be about creative leaps in products. It's been dark for a while without any big creative leap, and I think there's a lot of expectation that there are some big things coming.\"  On Apple's products, Sculley suggested that the company's next leap would be wearable technology, such as the much-discussed smart watch, which could allow consumers to make purchases with their credit card through the device.  \"I think Apple has been given a bad rap for a while,\" Sculley said. \"It's a stock that is ready to show some growth if Tim Cook is able to deliver on the products which he has set expectations for and I am pretty optimistic.\"  Sculley said he saw the recently released biopic \"Jobs\" on Thursday night. He said it was \"very loose on the facts\" because of a \"not really fair\" portrayal of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. However, he said that Ashton Kutcher effectively channeled Jobs' personality.   Sculley said the film helps to clear up a particular \"misunderstood fact.\" Many believe that he fired Jobs, and \"the movie shows that I never actually did,\" he said.   By CNBC's Paul Toscano.

Friday, 16 Aug 2013 | 1:01 PM ET  Dissecting this week's market action and the latest economic data with Gregg Fisher of Gerstein Fisher and Matt Litfin of William Blair, who said, \"The market needs to enter the tapering period and find out that it will be OK.\"    As the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P head for a second straight week of losses for just the fourth time this year, two top-rated fund managers have weighed in with some longer-term advice. Gregg Fisher, manager of the Gerstein Fisher Multi-Factor Growth Equity Fund, and Matt Litfin of the William Blair Small Mid-Cap Growth Fund are rated five-star money managers by research firm Morningstar. U.S. stocks are no longer the only game in town, Fisher said. \"Now is a good time to take a look at where you are strategically and trim down U.S. exposure and add exposure to foreign markets, bonds and other asset classes,\" he said during CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Friday. It's a \"good time to rebalance your portfolio,\" he added. Litfin is more sold on sticking with U.S. stocksfor now at leastand said, \"When you step back and look at the U.S. market, it does look pretty attractive to us. Inflation remains lowthat's especially true in food and energy.\"  The models at William Blair show consumer discretionary stocks are stretched, but Litfin said he likes Under Armoureven with the stock up 16 percent over the past month and 43 percent so far this year. Though it won't overtake Nike anytime soon, he said, he thinks the space is big enough for both companies. Litfin is also bullish on financial stocks, especially CBOE Holdings, which he called a \"very strong, durable business franchise.\" CBOE is up 62 percent this year.       Getty Images    Litfin also sees an improving budget picture in the U.S., although still far from ideal. But the shrinking deficit is a good sign, he said, especially for long-term investors. In the short term, he said \" tapering is coming,\" referring to an easing of the Fed's bond-buying program. Litfin said that could mean a drop in U.S. stocks. Once the Fed pares back the program, the market will get used to itmuch like children get used to bathing. \"You beg them to take a bath,\" he said. \"They don't want to. They finally get in and play for half an hour and you can't get them out. The market needs to enter the tapering period, see what it's like, look around and realize we're OK.\" The prospect of tapering makes Gregg Fisher of Gerstein Fisher more wary of U.S. stocks. \"Tapering, interest rates and inflation, these are big issues,\" he said. \"We're looking for assets without exposure to leverage.\" Fisher's top holdings are Apple, IBM and Google, with technology making up 23 percent of his portfolio. His fund is up 19.5 percent this year.  Litfin is up 26 percent year to date, with almost a third of his fund invested in industrials.  By CNBC's Jason Gewirtz "

"title": "Yoshikami: Paulson sold gold? So what!", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Getty Images    After months of reading headlines that John Paulson's perspective on gold had not changed, we suddenly read that he had cut his holdings significantly.  Just three months ago, he was quoted as saying that his thesis remains intact, but then we find that Paulson tactically adjusted his portfolios and reduced his gold position. What gives?  While one might be tempted to conjure up scenarios where words do not match actions, we think it's more a function of examining current conditions and making a new decision. And that is the risk associated with reading headlines and making investment decisions based on the latest comments from anyone: Those opinions can change, and they often do. The market is quite irrational. Gold has become the flag bearer for an environment with less predictability. Gold used to be a fairly predictable trade against inflation and volatility. Now gold trades based on Federal Reserve comments, interest rates, fear, hedge fund liquidity needs, etc.       Closing Bell Exchange  The Dow is down over 200 points on Fed uncertainty and disappointing earnings. Michael Yoshikami of Destination Wealth Management, Keith Fitz-Gerald of Money Map Press, Frank Fantozzi of Planned Financial Services and CNBC's Bob Pisani and Rick Santelli join to discuss the market selloff.      It's quite a puzzle to figure out and one we as an asset manager have decided not to attempt to decipher.  In many ways it's no different than the sentiment-based trading around Apple.  The company still has over $100 billion cash in the bank; the stock in the last 12 months has gone from $700 to $390 to $500, and nothing really has changed on a fundamental basis. This position is trading based on expectations and sentiment, and we expect this to continue in the short term. Long term, Apple will trade based on fundamentals; short-term and trades on mood and feeling; not terribly rational inputs. The market trades based on data, current perception of that data and future expectations. And institutional as well as individual investors either know that fact and invest accordingly, or they are subject to these rapidly changing trading conditions and are victims.    This is why it is important to understand the time horizon is key when determining your investment strategy.  If you are a short-term investor you better have a pretty good handle on mood and sentiment. If you are a long-term investor you better have a pretty good concept of the fundamentals and trends that will affect the asset you are investing in. And perhaps most importantly, remember that when you read headlines or hear interviews that opinions change and often do. Use interviews, columns, insights and protestations from those in the media as information to consider but not gospel and certainly not permanent ideology.  This means that in the end your opinion matters as well as well as your interpretation of others' viewpoints.   So the next time you read a headline that a prominent investor has adjusted a strategy after making previous statements about the wisdom of a particular course of action, remember that perspectives change.  Just because you read it or hear it doesn't mean it's permanent, and you should assume that every opinion that you hear is subject to adjustment prior to relying on that view when you make an investment decision.  Michael Yoshikami is the CEO and founder of the investment committee of Destination Wealth Management. "

"title": "Tesco may launch tablet to rival cheap androids ", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Getty Images   Global supermarket chain Tesco plans to launch a tablet device that will rival the likes of Apple and Amazon, the Sunday Times  newspaper reported on the weekend, with analysts saying a Tesco tablet could prove popular at the cheap end of the market. The newspaper said that Tesco is looking to enter the fiercely competitive tablet market with its own device that will come loaded with books, films and music, and could hit the shelves in time for Christmas.   The tablet is also expected to have apps that allow access to the supermarket's online grocery store and bank deals, as well as Tesco's own music and film download service, Blinkbox.  If successful, the product could help revive Tesco's DVD and book sales market, which has been put under pressure from online retailers like Amazon. However, analysts are mixed in their views on whether the supermarket chain's tablet will impact an already-saturated consumer area.  \"The biggest challenge that Tesco faces is to get consumers to buy the tablet. They need a unique selling point. What are they going to bring to make it different?\" Neil Saunders, retail analyst at Conlumino, told CNBC. \"It won't be a game changer to their sales fortunes and it seems to be more of an experiment.\"  But one analyst said that a Tesco tablet was \"not a bad proposition\" for a certain market.  \"There is a market for iPads and quite separately there is a market for very cheap generic android tablets, and this is where Tesco's device falls,\" Benedict Evans, analyst at Enders Analysis, told CNBC.   He said it was likely the Tesco product would be sold at around 150 pounds  and therefore would appeal to a wide audience.  Extensive details of the tablet were not available, but the Sunday Times cited industry sources who said the product would be \"high quality\" and similar to Amazon's Kindle.       Tesco's new concept store: more than just a gimmick?   Tesco has unveiled a brand new concept store in the UK in Watford. Tesco Extra is the latest experiment in transforming the supermarket into a retail destination.    If Tesco go ahead with the plan, it will not be the first supermarket to take on the tablet market. Asda, the store owned by Walmart, released the Arnova 8 in 2011 costing around 100 pounds.  For Tesco, the tablet would not only be used to drive sales, but would also be key in \"brand building\", according to Chris Lewis, a telecoms and ICT analyst at Lewis Insight.   \"Tesco are putting their device out there so they can use it as a window into the Tesco world and it is part of that brand building,\" Lewis told CNBC. \"They have to use all possible channels to drive the customer through to the product. Tesco will see it as an extension of their brand to reach the customer.\"  Tesco has been trying to appease investors after sales at its UK stores fell 1 percent in the 13 weeks to May 25. The supermarket chain is investing 1 billion pounds  in a turnaround plan to improve its performance in the U.K., where it makes two-thirds of its profits.  Tesco made no comment on the reports that it was launching a tablet device.    By CNBC's Arjun Kharpal: Follow him on Twitter @ArjunKharpal and @CNBCWorld "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Source: OpenDNS  OpenDNS employees take Yoga lessons on their company rooftop.   Most people consider themselves lucky if they can land a job with above average pay, a 401 and a healthy number of paid vacation days. But in Silicon Valley, that's just where the benefits begin.  Start-ups based in San Francisco Bay area are offering novel perksmassages, body analytics, subsidized rents, trips to Tahoe and even helicopter ridesin hopes they will beat competitors to top talent.    \"At big tech firms, you can get your dry cleaning on campus, nails done, breakfast, lunch, dinner, just things that make it easier to work longer,\" said Carolyn Betts, CEO of ,San Francisco-based Betts Recruiting, which specializes in hiring for tech start-ups.    \"With start-ups, it's the same thing. They are trying to do whatever they can to mimic these larger companies so that they can compete for the same talent.\"   Making it personal  While Google, Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants may offer employees huge salaries and their own set of fancy perks, start-ups are taking a more personal approach.  For example, the video monitoring hardware and software company Dropcam offers each employee  a free helicopter ridepiloted by the company CEO Greg Duffyto the destination of their choice.    Weebly, a website creation tool, gives each employee a monthly credit of $50 to Exec, which provides an on-demand errand service. And OpenDNS, an enterprise network security company, takes all of its employeesas well as their familieson a paid trip to Tahoe each year where they stay at the Ritz Carlton.  While the trip to Tahoe allows employees a chance to relax and get to know each other, other perks offered back at the office are meant to make workers' lives more simple, said David Ulevitch, founder and CEO of OpenDNS.  \"The goal with anything perks-wise is about making life easier,\" Ulevitch said. \"Work is stressful, you literally spend the majority of your life at work, so we want to create things that make their lives easier.\"  Some of these benefits include a laundry service, free catered lunches throughout the week, and rooftop yoga twice a week.   Healthy perks  Health and well-being benefits are a common theme among start-up perks, but the companies aren't just giving away gym memberships.  For example, Weebly offers each employee access to two free annual WellnessFX draws, which provides a personalized assessment of a user's blood chemistry and then breaks down the health data in easy-to-understand charts.    The company also pays for massages and yoga classes every other week.  But one of the key ways Weebly and many other start-ups are trying to encourage a healthy lifestyle is by giving employees flexible work schedules and unlimited vacation days.  \"We're not treating everyone like children. We give our employees more flexibility, and people regulate themselves and regulate their work,\" said David Rusenko, Weebly's CEO. \"People definitely rise to the occasion.\"    As long as employees are getting their work done, they can come and go as they please from the office, he said. The company's vacation policy is similar. \"We offer flexible vacation. We ask that employees keep it reasonable, but tell them to take as much vacation as they need,\" Rusenko said. Such liberal leave policies are about more than making sure employees have sufficient time off; they also help promote a healthy work-life balance, said Greg Schott, CEO of MuleSoft, a software and consulting company.  \"Some start-ups have that 24 hour, work every single night schedule. Ours tends to be that our employees can work from home or in evening if they have something to do like go to a parent-teacher conference,\" Schott said.   All you can eat    Source: OpenDNS  OpenDNS office lounge features a fully stocked bar.   The bottom line is that even with flexible work schedules, start-up employees will still end up spending tons of time at the office. But while they're there, they will eat like kings.  Providing employees with free food, as well as alcohol, is probably the most popular perk among start-ups in the Valley. Sure, small start-ups don't have a Google-size cafeteria, but thanks to local catering businesses, the firms are able to provide free meals for their employees.  Thumbtack, a company that operates an online marketplace where people can book local services, has an in-house chef who makes breakfast, lunch and dinner for employees. The company also has a dinner every Wednesday where employees are encouraged to bring their friends and family.  OpenDNS offers free lunch three days a week, which includes a different food truck at its office every Wednesday. Pinterest brings in food from restaurants everyday for lunch and dinner and Weebly has two meals a day catered for its employees.  Along with food, though, many start-ups also keep their offices stocked with alcoholic beverages. OpenDNS, for example, brought in a vintage bar that it keeps full of booze.   The cost   Source: Mulesoft  MuleSoft flies in all of its international employees to a West Coast retreat each year.  While all the free food, booze and trips have no financial impact on the employees, the perks certainly impact the company that is footing the bill. However, it's a small price to pay to maintain a company culture that attracts talent, start-up execs said.  \"Competition for talent is probably about as intense as it has ever been, including during the bubble,\" Schott said. \"It's a really hot hiring climate. People are in high demand. You have to have something superior in order to recruit people.\"  In other words, you have to spend money to make money, a notion that investors in these start-ups support.  "

"title": "UPDATE 1-Conde Nast launches new subscriber service with Amazon", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " NEW YORK Aug 20  - Magazine publisher Conde Nast announced a major partnership with Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday in which the Internet retailer will handle print anddigital subscriptions for glossy publications such as Vogue, Wired and Vanity Fair.Conde Nast is the first magazine publisher to collaborate with Amazon on this type of service, a move that will simplify and eventually save money on its subscription process and give it access to a huge new customer base. Currently, subscriptions involve direct mail and stacks of magazine insert cards.Amazon will allow consumers to purchase, manage and renew their subscriptions for seven of its top titles under a new \"all access\" plan that gives them both print and digital editions of select magazines using their Amazon accounts.For the time being, readers can still subscribe using the old paper-based method, but the idea is that Amazon will eventually handle all Conde Nast's magazine subscriptions if the arrangement is successful.For Amazon, it marks a new step into handling content, following forays into film and lending books. It gives the online retailer a chance to offer subscriptions to its more than 200 million customers and cross-sell goods to Conde Nast subscribers with the easy 'one-click' purchasing system.\"It's part of the Amazon initiative to improve its overall content portfolio,\" said R.J. Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar. \"It's a matter of getting more people to Amazon. It entices them to make more purchases elsewhere on Amazon, which should have some revenue and margin improvement opportunities.\"But it is just one piece of Amazon's ever-growing business, and likely not the lynchpin of any grand new strategy.\"It's a pretty small agreement in the grand scheme of things for Amazon,\" said Aaron Kessler at Raymond James. \"But it's definitely a positive if Amazon can become the backbone for more digital subscriptions.\"Analysts said it would make sense for Amazon to target other publishers' subscription services, but the company declined to give details about its plans.An obvious target would The Washington Post, which Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos bought for $250 million earlier this month.THE PLANConde Nast will offer readers a combined $6 introductory rate for six months of both the online and print versions of one of the following magazines: Vogue, Glamour, Bon Appetit, Lucky, Golf Digest, Vanity Fair and Wired.It plans to add its other 11 consumer titles, including the New Yorker, later in the year.Readers can still subscribe the old way through Conde Nast, and can also subscribe online through existing partner Apple Inc .The digital subscriptions will be made available on several mobile platforms, including the Kindle Fire, Apple's iPad and Google Inc's Android tablets and phones.It will introduce Conde Nast to new readers through Amazon's massive customer base.\"We are using the partnership with Amazon to make purchasing and renewing subscriptions as easy as humanly possible,\" Bob Sauerberg, president of Conde Nast, said in an interview last Wednesday.\"We want to go from selling print subscriptions to selling access to all our content,\" he added, referring to the introductory offer that allows readers to get online and print subscriptions bundled together for individual titles.Currently, online readers count for only about 4 percent of Conde Nast's total circulation of about 18.5 million copies, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. That suggests the glossy magazine as a physical object is not likely to disappear any time soon.\"Magazines have real deep value in both formats,\" said Russ Grandinetti, vice president of Kindle Content at Amazon. \"A lot of consumers want to keep one foot in both camps.\"STRIKING DEALSSauerberg and Grandinetti started to talk about a potential partnership over breakfast during the magazine trade organization MPA's annual conference last year.\"For years we have worked hard at trying to make buying anything really easy,\" Grandinetti said. \"Even though people really love magazines, I would not say they love the process of maintaining their subscription.\"Increasing digital copies is a key part of the magazine's industry future success as more people choose to read on smartphones and tablets, while advertisers are placing more dollars toward digital displays at the expense of print.At the same time, mobile device makers have a huge appetite for media content, including magazines, newspapers and TV shows to spur people to buy tablets and smartphones.Bezos' move to buy The Washington Post ignited speculation that he would transform the paper into a streaming news service delivered to tablets, computers and phones. Grandinetti would not comment on any plans involving the Post, adding that the paper is solely under Bezos' ownership.Even as tech companies court publishers, media companies have had an uneasy relationship with Silicon Valley since watching the music industry dwindle as people flocked to buy songs on iTunes for much less than the price of a CD.For example, Time Inc, a division of Time Warner Inc , the largest magazine publisher in the United States, was one of the last holdouts to join Apple's newsstand. The standoff was because the world's largest technology company did not want to share subscriber data with the publisher of Sports Illustrated and People.Subscriber information is critical to magazine publishers, who use it to give advertisers a better picture about their readers.Conde Nast is usually one of the first to wade into the water with innovations. For instance, it was the first to offer subscriptions through Apple's newsstand with the New Yorker.\"We really try and connect with the tech companies on the West Coast,\" Sauerberg said. \"We know what we're good at and they know what they are good at.\"In the agreement with Amazon, Sauerberg said Amazon is providing the same consumer data Conde Nast would get when a reader subscribes directly through the company.Amazon is taking a cut of the subscription revenue, although both companies declined to provide details. In other arrangements, Amazon typically takes 30 percent. "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " OTTAWA, Aug 21  - The Canadian government is watching smartphone maker BlackBerry Ltd carefully as it explores options including sale of the company but will not comment on its affairs, Industry Minister James Moore said on Wednesday.Loss-making BlackBerry, which has bled market share to Apple's iPhone and phones using Google's Android operating system, said last week it was weighing options that could include an outright sale.The company's new phones, introduced earlier this year, have sold less quickly than expected and BlackBerry expects more red ink for the current quarter at least.Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Moore said it was \"unfortunate\" that BlackBerry's new Q10 and the Z10 smartphones had not taken off with consumers.\"I know that they're facing their challenges and they're adjusting their firm internally in the way that best suits their interests,\" he said. \"And all I can say is, we wish them well, and we're keeping a close eye on the situation.\"Moore declined to speculate about whether a foreign bid for BlackBerry could run afoul of national security regulations. Asked if the government wanted BlackBerry to stay Canadian, he replied: \"We want them to do well, keep employing Canadians, keeping putting out innovative technologies and platforms, and we're paying close attention.\"BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion, made on-your-hip email possible with its first pagers and smartphones, coupled with strong security features.But the company was slow to embrace the important consumer market and rivals are rapidly pushing into the corporate and government market that BlackBerry used to own.

"title": "INSIGHT-At Apple, Tim Cook leads a quiet cultural revolution", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 22  - Shortly after signing on as chief operating officer at Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg was looking to connect with people in a similar role - No. 2 to a brilliant and passionate young founder. She called Tim Cook.\"He basically explained nicely that my job was to do the things that Mark  did not want to focus on as much,\" Sandberg said of the 2007 meeting that lasted several hours with the chief operating officer of Apple Inc.\"That was his job with Steve . And he explained that the job would change over time and I should be prepared for that.\"While Sandberg has enjoyed a steady run at Facebook, it is Cook's job that has changed radically since then. Now, the man who was handed one of the more daunting tasks in business - filling the shoes of the late Steve Jobs and keeping Apple on top - may himself need a spot of advice.Two years into Cook's tenure, Apple is expected to unveil a redesigned iPhone next month. It will be a key moment for Cook. The company he inherited has become a very different creature: a mature corporate behemoth rather than a scrappy industry pioneer, with its share price down 5 percent this year, despite a recent rally. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 15 percent this year.A transition was, perhaps, inevitable after an astonishing five-year run in which Apple's headcount tripled, its revenues rose over six-fold, its profits grew 12-fold, and its stock price jumped from $150 to a peak of $705 last fall.But it's been painful for some.It is unclear whether the spread-sheeting-loving, consensus-oriented, even-keeled Cook can successfully reshape the cult-like culture that Jobs built. Though Cook has deftly managed the iPhone and iPad product lines, which continue to deliver enormous profits, Apple has yet to launch a major new product under Cook; talk of watches and televisions remains just that.Some worry that Cook's changes to the culture have doused the fire - and perhaps the fear - that drove employees to try to achieve the impossible.CAN NICE GUYS FINISH FIRST?Cook is known as a workaholic who guards his privacy closely. People who know him well paint a portrait of a thoughtful, data-driven executive who knows how to listen and who can be charming and funny in small group settings.Lisa Cooper, who went to high school with Cook in Robertsville, Alabama, and remains a friend, still laughs at memories of Cook staging prank photos for the school yearbook and crooning \"The Way We Were\" to her in class.In the day to day at Apple, Cook has established a methodical, no-nonsense style, one that's as different as could be from that of his predecessor.Jobs' bi-monthly iPhone software meeting, in which he would go through every planned features of the company's flagship product, is gone.\"That's not Tim's style at all,\" said one person familiar with those meetings. \"He delegates.\"Still, he has a tough side. In meetings, Cook is so calm as to be nearly unreadable, sitting silently with hands clasped in front of himself. Any change in the constant rocking of his chair is one sign subordinates look for: when he simply listens, they're heartened if there is no change in the pace of his rocking.\"He could skewer you with a sentence,\" the person said. \"He would say something along the lines of 'I don't think that's good enough' and that would be the end of it and you would just want to crawl into a hole and die.\" Apple declined to comment on Cook or the company for this article.Cook's fans say that his methodical manner doesn't get in the way of decisive action. They point to the Apple Maps fiasco, in which Apple replaced Google's mapping product with its own on the iPhone and it quickly became clear that Apple's maps were not ready for prime time.Apple initially downplayed the glitches by saying Maps was a \"major initiative\" and they were \"just getting started.\" But behind the scenes, Cook bypassed Scott Forstall, the mobile software chief  who was responsible for maps, and tasked internet services honcho Eddy Cue with figuring out what exactly happened and what should be done.Cook had a lot of questions, and the episode also prompted him to fast-track his thinking on the future direction of the critical phone and tablet software known as iOS, a person close to Apple recounted.Cook soon issued a public apology to customers, fired Forstall, and handed responsibility for software design to Jony Ive, a Jobs soul-mate who had previously been in charge only of hardware design.\"The vision that Tim had to involve Jony and to essentially connect two very, very important Apple initiatives or areas of focus - that was a big decision on Tim's part and he made it independently and very, very resolutely,\" said Bob Iger, CEO of Walt Disney Co. and an Apple director.Still, employees report some grumbling, and Apple seems to have taken note, conducting a survey of morale in the critical hardware engineering unit earlier this year.\"As our business continues to grow and face new challenges, it becomes increasingly important to get feedback about your perceptions and experiences working in hardware engineering,\" Dan Riccio, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, wrote to his team in February in an email seen by Reuters.Some Silicon Valley recruiters and former Apple employees at rival companies say they are seeing more Apple resumes than ever before, especially from hardware engineers, though the depth and breadth of any brain-drain remains difficult to quantify, especially given the recent expansion in staff numbers.\"I am being inundated by LinkedIn messages and emails both by people who I never imagined would leave Apple and by people who have been at Apple for a year, and who joined expecting something different than what they encountered,\" said one recruiter with ties to Apple.Still, the Cook regime is also seen as kinder and gentler, and that's been a welcome change for many.\"It is not as crazy as it used to be. It is not as draconian,\" said Beth Fox, a recruiting consultant and former Apple employee, adding that the people she knows are staying put. \"They like Tim. They tend to err on the optimistic side.\"SOCIAL SIDEThere does seem to be, under Cook, a new willingness to admit mistakes and a more open approach to problems such as poor working conditions at Chinese contract manufacturers.\"On the social side, the only way for Apple to make a difference in the world in a broad way is to be - I believe strongly - is to be totally transparent,\" Cook said earlier this year at what was, paradoxically, a closed-door talk at his business school reunion.\"When you do that, you make a decision to report the bad and the good, and we hope that by doing that, that it puts pressure on everyone else to join.\"Under pressure from investors, Cook not only agreed to share more of Apple's $150 billion cash hoard with shareholders, he voluntarily tied his own pay more closely to stock performance.Yet critics wonder whether Cook's stated commitments to transparency and workers' rights really amount to much. Cook set up the global manufacturing system being criticized, and the company and its CEO remain highly secretive about matters large and small. Conditions at some Chinese factories have improved -Apple now tracks and reports hours of a million workers to avoid illegal overtime - but allegations of unfair working conditions continue to be made.Apple has also come under scrutiny over its tax structure, under which it has kept billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries so as to pay little or no taxes. Cook defended the policy, which is legal, at a Congressional hearing in May.Shareholders, meanwhile, are focused on the bottom line, and the next big product launch. A sharp drop in China revenue in April-June underscores the challenges Apple faces in its second-largest market as the technology gap with cheaper local rivals narrows and as Samsung Electronics keeps up a steady stream of new models across all price ranges.Cook got a vote of confidence this month when activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed he had amassed a large position in Apple stock.Bob Iger, the Apple director, said Cook had taken on \"a very, very difficult role given the person that he's succeeded and the company he's running.\"\"I think he's done so with a deft hand, a strong sense of himself,\" said Iger, who himself long toiled as the number two to a celebrated CEO, Michael Eisner. \"With that comes a real self-honesty that he is who he is, and not what the world expects him to be, or what Steve was. And I like that.\" "

"title": "Will China embrace the gold iPhone?", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Muriel de Seze    If Apple hopes to woo more Chinese by adding a glitzy coating - some call it champagne, some gold - to its next iPhone, it may be in for a surprise.  While gold is hugely popular as a safe haven and a status symbol - China is set to overtake India as the world's biggest gold consumer this year - shoppers at an Apple store in Beijing weren't all convinced it should be coupled with that pinnacle of mobile gadgetry.  Ni Suyang, a 49-year old worker at a Beijing state-owned enterprise, said that color mattered less to her than the glass surface and silver metallic finish.  \"A gold color looks high-end but is a little tacky,\" she said.    Gold and mobile phones are not strangers. Britain's Gold &amp; Co makes gold-plated iPhones, iPads and BlackBerrys which it also sells in India and China.  In Shenzhen many small local brands make gold-plated feature phones and smartphones. The less well-heeled can adorn their devices with jewel-studded and gold phone covers.  Apple's decision to add a champagne or gold covered iPhone to its range - confirmed by supply chain sources in Taiwan - would be a departure from its black and white norm.  Apple could be not reached for comment.   Commercially it makes sense, said Jerry Zou, Senior VP and Partner at FleishmanHillard, a public relations firm in Beijing. New colors would add \"novelty and variety, both of which are key to winning over fickle Chinese consumers\".  A champagne color \"would convey an image suggesting high-end luxury but a bit more restrained and subtle\".       Is Apple overpriced?   Adrian Drury, principal analyst for media and broadcast at Ovum, and Sharif Sakr, senior European editor at Engadget, discuss Apple stock, and stress that Apple needs a \"knock-out release\" of its new iPhone.   All that glitters...  But browsers at Apple's Xidan store weren't so sure - even on which gender would like it.  \"Gold is for guys, I think,\" said 22-year old Meng Xiang, a retail buyer working in Guangzhou, who said she preferred pink and white. \"I would consider buying a gold iPhone for my boyfriend.\"  Cui Baocheng, a 48-year-old bank manager, disagreed. \"I prefer black to gold,\" he said. \"Men usually like black. Champagne might be very ugly.\"  Indeed, there's a danger that by trying to broaden its appeal Apple may end up undermining what makes the iPhone so desirable in the first place.  Younger Chinese see gold as old-fashioned and tacky, and are increasingly opting for platinum - dubbed \"white gold\" in Chinese - for weddings and gifts.   \"An iPhone with more colors means that Apple is adapting to consumers' tastes, especially a gold color that Chinese people like,\" said Xu Fang, a 28-year old real estate agent. \"However, I think this might undermine the value and uniqueness of the brand.\"  Apple's sales in Greater China, its second biggest market, slumped 43 percent in April-June from the previous quarter. Its market share has almost halved since last year to below 5 percent, according to industry researcher Canalys.  The bigger problem, says Shanghai-based product designer Brandon Edwards, is that while gold added \"cultural relevance on top of Apple's inherent brand value\" and may attract premium users from other brands, \"Apple's main issue in China and emerging markets is centred around acquiring new customers, and this doesn't hit those people at all\".    Indeed, consumers in India, where Apple's market share is just over 2 percent, were just as skeptical. Mumbai phone retailer Manish Khatri said he did occasionally get customers asking for gold-colored phones, but the biggest deterrent to buying an iPhone for most of them was cost.  For others, gold is something to buy, not to slap on a mobile device. Said Vikas Jindal, a 35-year old Delhi businessman and a regular buyer of gold: \"I'll look stupid if I carry a gold-colored phone. A phone should be simple and sober. \"  "

Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one.

It got there in part by raising its dividend 15 percent and boosting its share buyback program six-fold to $60 billion, one of the largest of its kindAs part of that program, it bought about more than $16 billion worth of stock in the June quarter, much more than analysts had expected.Icahn told Reuters at the time that the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer maker has the ability to do a $150 billion buyback now by borrowing funds at 3 percent. And he argued that by increasing its program, Apple's stock could regain the $700 level it touched in September. "

A source familiar with the matter described the problem as a \"data feed issue.\"Rival exchanges halted trading of Nasdaq-listed shares shortly afterward at the request of Nasdaq, the second-biggest U.S. stock exchange operator.Options trading was also halted, the exchange added.The interruption means that investors had very limited market access to trade such familiar names as Apple Inc , Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp. In all, Nasdaq lists about 3,200 shares.\"I can't remember this happening in recent memory,\" said Christopher Nagy, president of consultancy firm KOR Trading and a former head of trading at TD Ameritrade.\"As we continue to eliminate human beings from the execution of security trading, this is the problem you run into,\" said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. \"These events are going to take place, given the level of automation.\"Trading of shares not listed on Nasdaq continued, but transactions could not be executed on the Nasdaq platform.Major market gauges such as the Nasdaq Composite Index and Nasdaq 100 were also affected. The composite had been up 0.87 percent when the disruptions struck and the 100 index was up 0.75 percent.The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which includes around 100 stocks listed on Nasdaq and as a result were not trading, was up about 0.75 percent on the session.Nasdaq declined to comment immediately beyond the electronic alerts it was issuing to traders. When trading resumes, estimated to be around 2:30 p.m., Nasdaq said it will precede the start with a 15-minute period when only price quote traffic will be permitted, not actual trades.The New York Stock Exchange's parent, NYSE Euronext, ceased all trading in Nasdaq-listed shares at the request of Nasdaq.BATS Global Markets, a stock exchange operator that itself was hit with a nearly hour-long outage on Aug. 6 , said it also disabled trading in some Nasdaq securities.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was monitoring developments and in touch with the exchanges.\"I would not want to speculate other than to say this is huge.

Nasdaq's own stock, which had been up 0.8 percent prior to the halt, traded down as much as 5.4 percent after trading resumed.Nasdaq blamed a problem with distributing stock price quotes for the shutdown.

Options trading was also halted.\"I can't remember this happening in recent memory,\" said Christopher Nagy, president of consultancy firm KOR Trading and a former head of trading at TD Ameritrade.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was in touch with the exchanges, with Chairman Mary Jo White overseeing developments from her home office near New York City.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama had also been briefed about the disruption.The interruption means that investors had very limited market access to trade such familiar names as Apple Inc , Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp.

It looks like they've learned their lesson.\"William Lefkowitz, options strategist at National Securities in New York, said options trading in such companies as International Business Machines Corp dried up during the halt. But he said the reopening was \"very orderly and liquidity is back to normal. It is almost like it did not happen.\"Thursday's outage was the latest high-profile glitch in U.S. stock markets.On Tuesday, a technical problem at Goldman Sachs Group Inc resulted in a flood of erroneous orders being sent to U.S. equity options markets.Two weeks earlier, on Aug. 6, stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets was hit with a nearly hour-long outage.Last year, a trading blowup at Knight Capital Group Inc was a contributing factor to the eventual sale of that company.\"The frequency of technical issues affecting trading is a wake-up call to business leaders in capital markets,\" said Lev Lesokhin, executive vice president of Cast, a specialist in business software analysis. \"They need to carefully scrutinize the structural integrity of their software systems.\"Other trading venues were also affected by Thursday's outage, and several \"dark pools,\" which execute orders anonymously, were forced to stop trading, according to several market participants.SECThursday's outage could cause problems for Nasdaq at the SEC, which has recently cracked down on stock exchanges to beef up their compliance with regulations and make sure they are policing themselves.White, who joined the regulator in April, is a Nasdaq veteran, having served on its board as recently as 2006.In June, a month after Nasdaq settled with the SEC over Facebook, the Chicago Board Options Exchange was ordered to pay $6 million to settle SEC charges that it failed to properly enforce short sale rules.The NYSE last year became the first exchange in SEC history to face a financial penalty after it supposedly gave some customers an \"improper head start\" on trading information.In March, the SEC proposed rules to require exchanges and other trading platforms to be better prepared to handle major market disruptions, including those caused by technology glitches. Those reforms are still out for public comment. "

Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one.

The company averted a dispute with hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who sued Apple to try to block a proposal regarding voting on preferred shares. Einhorn later withdrew his lawsuit.Analysts said Icahn's interest in Apple helped cement improving sentiment on the stock, as investors began to anticipate a new line-up of gadgets in the fall, including possibly a cheaper iPhone that can spearheard a deeper drive into fast-growing emerging markets.Speculation has also persisted that the company may be planning some sort of TV or smartwatch product - worn on the user's wrist - in the near future.Cook said last month there will be products \"in new categories\" but gave no details.

Most of that revenue growth came from Pandora's mobile business, which grew 92 percent from last year to $116 million.On average, analysts expected revenue of $156.3 million and earnings of 2 cents per share, according to FactSet.Pandora said that total listener hours rose 18 percent to 3.88 billion in the second quarter, from 3.3 billion a year ago.Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company expects revenue between $174 million and $179 million and adjusted earnings between 3 cents and 6 cents per share. Analysts expect revenue of $171 million and earnings of 8 cents per share for the quarter, according to FactSet.For the fiscal year, the company expects revenue between $640 million and $655 million and adjusted earnings between breakeven and 5 cents per share. Analysts expect revenue of $633.2 million and earnings of 4 cents per share for the year, according to FactSet.The company also said it reversed its decision to limit free listening on mobile devices. In March, Pandora had capped free listening on mobile devices to 40 hours per month to limit royalty costs and convert more listeners into subscribers. While the limit was in place, Pandora said it only affected under 4 percent of its total monthly active listeners.Pandora is facing increased competition this year. It already competes with Spotify, Google Inc. and others in the space, and Apple Inc. plans to launch its own radio service in the fall.Shares of Pandora fell $1.46, or 6.7 percent, to $20.25 in after-hours trading Thursday, after closing up 22 cents at $21.71 during the regular trading session.

"title": "UPDATE 3-Pandora: Sing a song of slumping shares", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 22  - Internet radio service Pandora Media Inc said on Thursday that rising expenditures to acquire music and expand its sales force would push fiscal 2014 earnings below analyst expectations, and its shares slumped 5 percent.The company also backtracked on a 40-hour monthly limit on free music streaming that was announced just six months ago, a measure originally implemented to control rising costs. Pandora said it will lift the monthly cap Sept. 1 after watching its margins improve.The mixed message added to a sense of uncertainty surrounding Pandora, which has otherwise reclaimed favor recently on Wall Street. Aside from Spotify and Rdio, its usual rivals, Pandora will soon face competition from Apple Inc , which is preparing to launch its iTunes Radio offering in the coming weeks.Excluding certain items, Pandora said it expected to earn between 0 and 5 cents per share for the year. That was below the 5 cent profit expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Its shares fell to $20.50 in extended trade.But for the second quarter, Pandora exceeded expectations, posting revenue of $162 million, a 58 percent rise, as it continued to pick up listeners. Its earnings of 4 cents also topped Wall Street expectations of 2 cents.In an interview, Chief Executive Joe Kennedy said he felt confident the company has proven its mobile monetization strategy. But he signaled that earnings would be depressed in the near future as he pursued an aggressive investment strategy. In the past year, for instance, the company has increased its sales force by three-quarters, he said.\"We're taking the increased margin that we're getting and reallocating to invest in future growth,\" Kennedy said on Thursday. \"But everything says we're firing on all cylinders. We're still in the earliest days. We have to invest to make the most of a huge opportunity.\"Kennedy downplayed the threat of competitors, saying that 7 percent of all radio listening was on Pandora, making it the most popular online radio option.\"We've been on the market now for 8 years, and we've had competitors large and small,\" he told Reuters. \"We're still the undisputed leader.\"Kennedy told analysts the company would keep its international expansion plans on hold but continue to aggressively expand at the local level by selling targeted ads for local businesses. But that would mean a significant effort to ramp up sales across the country, he warned.Steven Frankel, an analyst at Dougherty &amp; Co, said it was disappointing to see that \"hard fought monetization gains aren't going to translate into bottom line upside.\"\"This guidance is a reflection that this is a very difficult and expensive business to scale,\" Frankel said. \"Just when we thought we understood all the cost dynamics, there's another layer of complexity here.\"Pandora's shares, which fluctuated wildly for the first year after its June 2011 initial public offering, surged to a record closing high of $21.71 on Thursday.Pandora users listened to the service for a total of 3.88 billion hours during the quarter, an 18 percent increase from 3.30 billion hours a year ago, the company said.Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley &amp; Co, said although Apple's entry into the market could siphon away some listeners, it could ultimately help Pandora by expanding the market for Internet radio advertising.The iPhone-maker has already signed up advertisers including McDonald's, Pepsi and Procter and Gamble ahead of the radio service's imminent launch, according to an AdAge report.\"If Apple can prove to those advertisers that Internet radio works, then you could expect to see a lot of advertising dollars come into the market,\" Sinha said.

"content": " * China Mobile awards initial 4G contracts worth $3.2 bln* Huawei, ZTE get more than half of total* Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent, Nokia Siemens secure a third* China Mobile says 4G tender going smoothlySINGAPORE, Aug 23  - China Mobile Ltd has awarded initial 4G contracts worth around 20 billion yuan , with Chinese firms securing more than half of the biggest prize in the global telecoms industry this year and foreign firms winning about a third, industry sources said.Telecoms equipment makers, such as global leader Ericsson and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, have been waiting for China Mobile's 4G tender to lift the fortunes of an industry that has been hit by a lack of spending worldwide.The development of a 4G network by the carrier, which with more than 700 million mobile customers is the world's largest by subscribers, is also regarded as key to it clinching an agreement with Apple Inc to carry its blockbuster iPhone.\"This is the tender that global telecom equipment vendors have been vying for this year,\" said an industry source.\"Even though we see Huawei and ZTE getting the bulk of the contracts and foreign vendors getting around a third, I'm sure they will keep going back to China Mobile and get a bit more share.\"Shenzhen-based Huawei and crosstown rival ZTE have obtained about 25 percent each of the total 4G procurement in China Mobile's tender this year, said the sources, who are familiar with the negotiations but declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media.European vendors Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent SA and Nokia Siemens Networks  have obtained a share of around 10 percent each, the sources said.The first wave of 4G investments that began in 2010 in Japan and Korea favoured Ericsson and NSN, while the second in the United States went largely to Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent. Huawei won a chunk of Europe's 4G contracts last year.Some western markets have been wary of using Huawei and ZTE equipment on their networks.The European Union has been considering launching an investigation into whether both Chinese firms benefit from illegal government subsidies, while a U.S. congressional committee is probing whether their equipment poses national security risks.STEP TOWARDS IPHONE DEALChina Mobile said in an emailed statement that the tender had indeed begun and the progress had been smooth, with the carrier planning to build 200,000 base stations this year, in line with its previous target.Huawei and Ericsson could not be reached immediately for comment. ZTE declined to comment, while Alcatel-Lucent said it had not yet heard of any official decision from China Mobile.So far, China Mobile has only spent around a third of its full-year capital expenditure of 190.2 billion yuan in the first half, with the market expecting spending to speed up once the tender takes place.ZTE, which is listed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, is expected to post a third quarterly profit for the July-September period due to cost-cutting measures and as it shunned low-margin contracts that resulted in its first-ever annual loss last year.\"We believe telcos' capex will be heavily skewed to the second half of 2013, which will refuel ZTE's carrier networks segment's momentum,\" brokerage CMB International said in a report.\"ZTE withdrew from some overseas market and re-focused on domestic operator's contracts to protect  margin.\"The Chinese government is likely to issue licences later this year, which will help China Mobile compete better with its rivals China Unicom and China Telecom, which have better 3G technologies.And with Apple expected to unveil its next iPhone and a cheaper version next month that will likely support China Mobile's 4G TD-LTE technology, everything seems to be falling in place for the two giants to sign an agreement.China Mobile is the only Chinese carrier without an iPhone contract, which will be key to lifting the percentage of higher-end, data-crunching users on its network.By mid-morning, China Mobile's shares had risen 0.3 percent, while ZTE's stock was down 0.3 percent, underperforming the main Hang Seng Index's 0.5 percent gain.

"title": "Carl Icahn plans dinner date with Apples Tim Cook", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Getty Images  Tim Cook and Carl Icahn   Carl Icahn has spoken again with Apple's Tim Cook and plans a longer discussion with the chief executive over dinner next month about the size of the iPhone maker's buyback program, the activist investor tweeted on Thursday.  The hedge fund billionaire, known for launching aggressive assaults on American boardrooms, caused a sensation last week when he revealed on Twitter he had taken a large position in Apple and was pushing for the company to expand its program of share buybacks -- already one of the market's largest.  That revelation, including comments about how he thought the stock was undervalued, pushed shares of the $400 billion corporation up 5 percent on August 13.    But on Thursday, Apple's stock held steady at about $501.11 in late trade on the Nasdaq, resuming trade after a glitch halted trading in Nasdaq-listed securities for more than two hours.  Icahn's tweet on Thursday, which came during the trading suspension, did not reveal much else apart from the fact that he and Cook had made plans for an in-person tete-a-tete next month.  \"Spoke to Tim. Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one. What will be discussed is magnitude,\" the billionaire said on Twitter on Thursday, without elaborating.    Apple did not respond to requests for comment. In April, the company bowed to Wall Street pressure and said it would return $100 billion to shareholders by the end of 2015 - double the amount set aside previously. It got there in part by raising its dividend 15 percent and boosting its share buyback program six-fold to $60 billion, one of the largest of its kind  As part of that program, it bought about more than $16 billion worth of stock in the June quarter, much more than analysts had expected.  Another assault  Icahn told Reuters last week that the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer maker has the ability to do a $150 billion buyback now by borrowing funds at 3 percent. And he argued that by increasing its program, Apple's stock could regain the $700 level it touched in September.  Icahn, who this year launched strong opposition to Michael Dell's $25 billion effort to take Dell private, did not say how many shares of Apple he holds.  A source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because Icahn hasn't disclosed his holdings in Apple, said the investor's stake was worth around $1 billion, a fraction of the company's market value of more than $400 billion.   He is the second prominent activist to target Apple this year. The company averted a dispute with hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who sued Apple to try to block a proposal regarding voting on preferred shares. Einhorn later withdrew his lawsuit.  Analysts said Icahn's interest in Apple helped cement improving sentiment on the stock, as investors began to anticipate a new line-up of gadgets in the fall, including possibly a cheaper iPhone that can spearhead a deeper drive into fast-growing emerging markets.  Speculation has also persisted that the company may be planning some sort of TV or smartwatch product - worn on the user's wrist - in the near future.  Cook said last month there will be products \"in new categories\" but gave no details.    "

Prior to that, he led numerous divisions, including sales and support and operating-systems development.2000 - Ballmer succeeds Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in January. The two met as students at Harvard University, where Gates lived down the hall from Ballmer. In 1975, 19-year-old Gates dropped out of Harvard and went on to found Microsoft along with Paul Allen.2001 - In November, Microsoft enters the gaming market with the North American release of its Xbox gaming console, competing with game consoles from Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Corp. .2005 - Microsoft launches the next-generation Xbox 360 video game console in November, strengthening its foothold in the video game hardware market.2006 - Microsoft launches Zune portable music player in November. It is the first Microsoft-designed device to compete in a market dominated by Apple Inc's iPod. The music player does not gain enough of a market, and Microsoft discontinues selling it by mid-2012.2007 - In January, Microsoft unveils the Windows Vista, which becomes the company's least popular operating system.2008 -- Ballmer makes an unsolicited $44.6 billion, $31-per-share, cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo Inc's board. Yahoo rejects the bid as too low.2009 - Microsoft revamps its search engine to counter Google Inc's dominance in the Web search and related advertising business. In May, Ballmer reveals the new search engine, dubbed \"Bing\" that is set for a June release.2009 -- In July, Microsoft and Yahoo launch a 10-year Web search deal to challenge market leader Google. Under the deal, the two companies agree that Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. They have been in on-again, off-again talks since Yahoo rebuffed Microsoft's takeover bid.2010 - Microsoft releases its Windows Phone operating system for mobile phones, trying to claw its way into the smartphone market and woo consumers away from Apple's iPhone and Google's Andriod devices.2011 - In February, Nokia and Microsoft strike a deal, in a bid to take on the smartphone market. By 2013, the partnership has yet to produce a product that has taken market share from Google and Apple.2012 - Microsoft, hoping for a hit, launches Surface tablets and its Windows 8 operating system that uses touch commands. The devices do not gain much market share in the tablet market, dominated by Apple's iPad and Samsung's Galaxy mobile devices.2013 - On August 23, Ballmer announces he will step down within 12 months, surprising industry watchers.

"content": "  Stocks kicked off the week with a thud, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 logging their first four-day losing streaks this year, as Treasury yields hit a two-year high amid ongoing worries over when the Federal Reserve might start to reduce its asset purchases.  \"All of last week, people were trying to make the story match the market move,\" said Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital. \"If the pullback last week was due to tapering worries, then I think we may have overdone it. I was more concerned about the actual negative newsweak guidance from Cisco and earnings misses from Macy's, Wal-Mart and Kohl's.\"           Name Price  Change %Change DJIA   ---   S&amp;P 500   ---   NASDAQ   ---     The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 70.73 points to finish at 15,010.74, closing near the psychologically-important 15,000 level, dragged by JPMorgan and Alcoa. Last week, the index suffered its worst weekly decline of 2013, shedding 2.2 percent.  The S&amp;P 500 fell 9.77 points to close at 1,646.06. And the Nasdaq declined 13.69 points to close at 3,589.09. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on track for their biggest monthly declines since May 2012.  The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, jumped above 15.  Most key S&amp;P sectors finished in the red, led by energy and financials.        Major averages slip to start week Monday, 19 Aug 2013 | 3:50 PM ET  The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are at the lows of the session. Brian Belski, BMO Capital Markets, and Chris Hyzy, U.S Trust join to discuss what it will take to get back into positive territory.    \"The movement in the market is a bit exaggerated when volume is light and that's going to be the case over the next couple of weeks,\" said Hogan. \"We don't have much this week but we do have a real concentration of information on Wednesday and Thursday including the Fed's meeting minutesuntil we get some news in terms of what tapering is going to look like, we may be sideways this week.\"  With no major economic data on tap Monday, trading will likely be light as investors look ahead to the minutes of the last Fed meeting, which will be released on Wednesday, for clues as to when the central bank will start scaling back its $85 billion per month stimulus program.  In Asia, China's benchmark index, the Shanghai Composite, climbed 0.8 percent as sentiment recovered, following last week's trading error at Everbright Securities. Plus, the Japanese Nikkei reversed earlier losses after posting a wider-than-expected monthly trade deficit, which cast some doubt on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's aggressive economic policies.    On the earnings front, Saks slipped after the upscale department-store chain posted a winder-than-expected quarterly loss after weak sales. Saks became the latest retailer to post lackluster sales. Last week, Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's and Wal-Martall posted lower-than-expected sales. In July, Saks reached a deal to be acquired by Canada's Hudson's Bay.  Urban Outfitters and Bob Evans are schedule to post results after the closing bell.  Intel rallied after Piper Jaffray lifted its rating on the semiconductor company to \"neutral\" from \"underweight\" and raised its price target to $22 from $20. Google ticked higher on the ninth anniversary of its IPO. The search-engine giant's stock has skyrocketed an impressive 900 percent since going public in 2004 at $85 apiece. Only nine other stocks have outperformed Google in the last nine years. Priceline, Apple, Netflix and Salesforce are among notable names. JPMorgan Chase declined following weekend reports that U.S. authorities have opened a bribery investigation into whether the bank hired the children of Chinese officials to help it win lucrative business.       Are markets complacent about tapering?   Michael Gallagher, director of research at IDEAglobal, discusses the U.S. Treasurys market and how the rally in yield is a \"wake up call\".    In the bond markets, yields on 10-year benchmark Treasurys briefly touched 2.90 percent, the highest since July 2011 amid Fed tapering concerns. So far this month, U.S. bond mutual funds and ETFs have seen outflows of $19.7 billion, according to TrimTabs.  \"Heavy bond fund redemptions and the backup in bond yields should concern all investors, not just bond investors, because the U.S. economy is a highly leveraged economy that will not easily tolerate higher borrowing costs,\" TrimTabs CEO David Santschi said in a report.    Most homebuilders traded in the red, dragged by KBHome and Beazer.  Oil prices reversed their gains to close slightly lower but unrest in Egypt and the loss of Libyan oil exports put a limit on losses. Oil prices are likely to drift higher this week, CNBC's weekly sentiment survey showed. However, price gains may be limited, as analysts said the uptick in political instability in Egypt had already been priced in.  \"There is still too much oil,\" said Thomas McMahon, director of the Pan Asia Clearing Enterprise and former chief executive officer of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange. \"But cheap dollars, technical disconnect and Egypt seems to be sweeping this aside.

Monday, 19 Aug 2013 | 5:20 PM ET  On the ninth anniversary of Google's initial public offering, the CNBC \"Fast Money\" traders weigh in on how they're trading the stock.   Nine years after its initial public offering and a 900 percent gain over that period, Google still has bright days ahead, Stuart Frankel's Steve Grasso said Monday.  \"I'm still a believer in Google. I still love it,\" he said. \"It's probably my all-time favorite trade.\"  On CNBC's \"Fast Money,\" Grasso also said that while he remained long, he had taken profits and sold two-thirds of his position in Google, looking to buy it back on a dip.  Apple, Grasso said, was a different story.  \"The only problem with Apple is that it's become a buyback story,\" he added.       Fast Forward: Home Depot &amp; Best Buy  Home Depot and Best Buy will report earnings on Tuesday. The \"Fast Money\" traders take their positions.    That suited James Lebenthal of Lebenthal Asset Management just fine.  \"I think Apple is where Google was two years ago before the 30 percent run-up,\" he said. \"Google may still have another 15 percent.  \"Hey, Google may still have another 15 percent. I don't know. But I'm more certain that Apple has 15 percent.\"    Josh Brown of Fusion Analytics said that he thought the market was going to take Google stock higher.  \"I don't love any stock,\" he said. \"The market is voting as we speak.\"  Brown noted that Google has been growing at about 18 percent a year and called its stock price \"perfectly reasonable.  \"I can't imagine this stock not getting to $1,000, barring any kind of market cataclysm,\" he added.

Revenue was also above forecasts, and the home retailer also raised its sales and earnings estimates for the full year, reflecting the housing market's improvement.  Best Buy The electronics retailer earned 32 cents per share for the second quarter, excluding certain items, beating estimates by 20 cents. Revenue also beat consensus, although the company does say second half results will be hurt by a number of factors including mobile warranty costs.        Earnings Recap: BBY, JCP &amp; HD  CNBC's Courtney Reagan breaks down the numbers on retailers, Best Buy, JC Penney, and Home Depot, all reporting second quarter results this morning.   J.C. Penney The retailer lost $1.17 per share for the second quarter, bigger than the $1.06 per share loss estimated by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was also below consensus, with Penney hurt by unusually high markdowns and failed prior merchandising and promotional strategies. Separately, Hayman Capital's Kyle Bass has taken a long position in the retailer's secured debt, according to Bloomberg.  Dick's Sporting Goods The sporting goods retailer earned 71 cents per share for the second quarter, three cents shy of estimates. The company cites a \"sluggish consumer environment\" and bad weather as factors in its quarterly results.  Urban Outfitters The company reported second quarter profit of 51 cents per share, three cents above estimates. The teen apparel retailer's results were helped by fewer discounts and higher profit margins, even though revenue was slightly below Street forecasts.  Nokia Bernstein is predicting a \"disastrous\" September quarter for the handset maker, as it repeated an \"underperform\" rating. The firm said Nokia's reliance on newly launched high end models is a \"risky bet\".  Zynga Jefferies began coverage of the online gaming company with a \"sell\" rating. Jefferies sees long term potential but said risks may come to the forefront sooner than new growth initiatives.  JPMorgan Chase The Wall Street mega bank is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into energy market manipulation, according to Dow Jones. In July, the bank agreed to pay $410 million to settle similar allegations by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, although it did not admit to wrongdoing in that case.  BHP Billiton BHP reported second half profit that missed analyst forecasts after falling 15 percent from a year earlier, and its new CEO Andrew Mackenzie is also planning a less ambitious expansion into the potash market than previously planned.  Ann The retailer's shares were upgraded to \"buy\" from \"neutral\" at Janney, which points to improved product offerings and an attractive valuation.  Tesla The automaker's model S received the highest safety rating ever issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Southwest Airlines  The airline is being challenged in some of its markets by Allegiant Air, a smaller airline which has announced a new expansion into some East Coast markets served by Southwest.  Electronic Arts  EA tells Reuters it expects a boost from new gaming consoles being released by Sony and Microsoft later this year. Chief operating officer Peter Moore said the company sees growth even for physical boxed games, a segment that has generally declined as customers switch to online and mobile gaming.  AOL  The Internet portal has won dismissal of a lawsuit that accused both the company and some executives of fraud. The case stemmed from a share buyback, and the subsequent $1 billion sale of a patent portfolio to Microsoft that resulted in a 43 percent single-day surge in AOL's stock.  Apple Apple has hired fitness industry consultant Jay Blahnik, according to All Things D. Blahnik was a key developer of Nike's FuelBand activity tracking device.

"title": "Smartphones: Why one size doesn't fit all anymore", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Getty Images   Whether it's huge screens, miniscreens, flashy colors or novel features, smartphone vendors are making a huge effort to stand out in the sea of devices available on the market.  But while all the specs and fancy functions may look impressive on paper, it doesn't necessarily mean consumers will bite.  Here's a look at what smartphone trends analysts say will actually stick when it comes to mass market adoption.   One size does not fit all   Source: YouTube  Samsung Galaxy Mega  Samsung's latest phone, the Galaxy Mega, is the latest example of trying to stand out. The smartphone, which launches Friday on AT&amp;T for $150, measures 6.3 inches diagonally, making it almost as big as a 7-inch tablet.  Samsung says that the new Mega is meant to work as a hybrid between a phone and a tablet so that consumers don't have to buy two products. However, the size of the phone may be more of a joke to consumers instead of a practical device.  \"It's becoming a little silly,\" said Carolina Milanesi, a vice president of research on Gartner's consumer devices team. \"It seems to me these companies are doing it just for sake of doing it.\" Huawei rolled out its 6.1-inch Ascend Mate smartphone earlier this year, so Samsung had to play catch-up to that, she said.  \"Five inches use to be the best size and then 5 inch became the norm and so companies felt like they needed to go up, and if you do 5.5-inch screen, people are going to catch up to you very quickly. So they jumped to the 6 inches,\" she said.  But with the phones entering the 6-inch range, the line between phone and tablet becomes blurred. Vendors, though, argue the large size solves the problem of having to carry two different devicesa tablet and a smartphoneat the same time.  And while this may be a solution for some consumers, it's really not a problem most people have.  While there is a growing number of tablet users, most of them only use their tablet at home, Milanesi said. In addition, most people still a want something they can fit in their pocket while they're on the go, which is why she said she doesn't see these extra large smartphones having mass appeal.  \"I've always been a skeptic about very large screen smartphones,\" Milanesi said. \"As much as you want people thinking they are getting one device with everything, it's still not quite practical. And as prices on 7-inch tablets continue to [get] lower, you will have more consumers who can afford both so they will buy both.\" But there is definitely a market for the large-screen phones, said Charles Golvin, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. While the sweet spot for a smartphone size remains 4-5 inches, there's a segmented group of consumers who will prefer a bigger device, he said.  \"You can't just have a one size fits all. Now people have a lot more choice, they have a lot more experience, they know what they like, and what they don't like. For some people, bigger is better; they like the bigger screen,\" Golvin said. \"They are definitely not mainstream; most people want something that is more pocketable than that. ... [But] they are still selling.\"  While Samsung is going big, HTC is going smaller. The HTC One Mini, which also launches Friday on AT&amp;T for $99.99 with a two-year contract, features a 4.3-inch screen, making it slightly smaller than the full size version's 4.7 inches.  However, while the Mini may be smaller than some of its competitors, it's still about the same size as an iPhone 5, which has a 4-inch display screen.  \"When the HTC Mini was announced, it made me smile to see something that's 4.3-inches considered a mini, 2.6-inch was once considered a mini,\" Milanesi said. \"If you go back a few years ago, Ericsson had a 2.6-inch mini. It was incredibly small. We haven't had 2.6-inch screen for years now, and now 4.3-inch is not that small.\"   Gold iPhones and other customization   Getty Images  Motorola's Moto X   In addition to custom sizes, consumers are also becoming more concerned about being in control of how their phone looks, sounds and how they interact with their device, Golvin said.  \"Personalization is clearly a continuing trend in this space. The smartphone is the most personal device people carry with them. There is this need for consumers to standout among their peers,\" Golvin said.  A big way vendors are trying to appeal to consumers when it comes to customization is by giving them more control of the color.  Google-owned Motorola Mobility, for example, introduced a variety of color options for the casing of its new Moto X. The HTC One comes in red and is rumored to also come in blue soon. And the latest Nokia Lumia Windows Phone comes in yellow, in addition to the usual black and white.  Apple may soon also be getting in on the color game with its new iPhone, which is expected to launch this fall.    According to a TechCrunch report Monday, Apple will likely roll out its next generation iPhone with a new color option when it reveals its iPhone 5S this autumn. The company is planning to introduce the new phone in a shade of gold, similar to a champagne color, according to the report.  Golvin said while he's not sure Apple will roll out a gold colored iPhone, he does think the company will introduce a new color soon.  \"It's not a matter of if Apple will add more colors, but it's really a matter of when ... and what is that color going to be,\" Golvin said. \"If you look at the competition and what they are offering, it's reasonable to say that Apple has reached the end of the line of just offering black and white.\"   New features aren't just gimmicks      New iPhone on the way?  AllThingsD reported that Apple is expected to unveil its next smartphone at a special event on Sept. 10, reports the \"Squawk on the Street\" crew.   Along with the display screen size personalization options, smartphone vendors are also experimenting with new ways for consumers to interact with their devices.  \"One of the challenges all smartphone makers face today is that there aren't that many areas in hardware where these companies can distinguish themselves,\" Golvin said. \"There's size and pixel density, color depth, but realistically there are only a few screen suppliers out there and they all use them. ... What that leaves is software innovations.\"  Some of the software innovations gaining traction among smartphone makers are voice-controlled commands and gesture-controlled navigation. These functions make smartphones more convenient to use and shouldn't be considered gimmicks, Golvin said.  \"As new capabilities come into these devices, there is a cycle of forcing a change in customer behavior and how they use them,\" Golvin said.  These functions are similar to how the touchscreen was perceived when it first came out, he said. Many people weren't sure if consumers would adopt the technology, but eventually it became embedded in consumer behavior, he said.  However, it's worth noting that voice-control commands, like the Google Now feature on Motorola Mobility's Moto X and Apple's Siri on the iPhone, are moving into the mainstream more so than gesture control functionality, Golvin said.

Japan's Nikkei closed at a near two-month low and China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.6 percent. \"The market did an excellent job of ignoring the overseas market damage this morning,\" wrote Elliot Spar, market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus. \"If the market can have strong close today, my upside target is the gap at 1,685 on the S&amp;P. We really don't want to get there too fast. Many damaged sectors and names need time to repair themselves. A rally in the S&amp;P back to the recent high at 1,709 that is accompanied by numerous negative divergences would not be healthy for the market.\"       Best sector for the next decade?  Mark Tepper, Strategic Wealth Partners, and Robert Luna, SureVest Capital Management, share their picks for the best sector over the next 10 years.  Meanwhile, several retailers bucked the recent downbeat earnings trend. Best Buy surged to lead the S&amp;P 500 gainers after the consumer electronics retailer easily topped Wall Street expectations.  Urban Outfitters soared after the specialty retailer posted earnings that beat expectations. At least four brokerages lifted their price targets on the company.  JCPenney posted sales that continued to fall sharply last quarter, but the troubled retailer said the back-to-school season has so far been \"encouraging.\" The company also said sales trend had improved every month in the quarter. Shares traded higher.  And Dow component Home Depot posted second quarter earnings that topped expectations and raise its full-year guidance, citing the rebounding housing market.    Analog Devices and Intuit are among notable companies scheduled to post earnings after the closing bell.  Apple dipped after S&amp;P Capital IQ downgraded the iPhone maker to \"buy\" from \"strong buy.\" S&amp;P Capital IQ equity analyst Scott Kessler said the stock was nearing his target price of $550, and noted that it had already risen 30 percent off a low set on June 27. Sony will release its PlayStation 4 console on November 15 in North America. The company said pre-orders for the new console has already exceeded one million.  Barclays declined after a U.S. appeals court said investors may revive a lawsuit that alleges the bank misled them about its subprime mortgage exposure.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   iLexx | E+ | Getty Images    Stickers used in messaging applications are delivering healthy revenues for Asian technology firms, and as the craze starts to sweep the Western world, more companies are looking for a slice of the cash.The stickers, otherwise known as emojis are more advanced siblings of emoticons and have been a firm part of Japanese tech culture for the last ten years. After spreading first to the rest of Asia, they are now reaching the Western world, boosted by Apple's  inclusion of them in its iOS5 software. Stickers can be anything from simple smileys to dancing pandas, and can express a range of emotions. Their global acceptance was underlined last week with the release of pop star Katy Perry's latest music video, which heavily featured the colorful images.   But behind the cuteness lies cash. Japanese company Line, credited as one of the first companies to monetize the trend, announced core revenue of 9.77 billion yen  in its second quarter. Sticker purchases made up 27 percent  of revenue, and the company hopes to have 300 million subscribers by the end of the year. In a press conference on Tuesday, Line revealed there have been over 7 billion messages and 1 billion stickers sent as of August 2013, according to industry blog SD Japan. Korean rival, Kakao Talk, is having a similar boom. Its mobile games service generated 348 billion Won  in revenue during the first half of 2013. \"You can see how many tens of millions they are doing every quarter, it's very profitable,\" Riku Salminen, CEO of Jongla, a Finnish messaging app provider, told CNBC.  Jongla launched its first messaging app last year, after the company was established in 2009. Salminen has instituted the \"Jongla Way\" at the firm, using local content from local illustrators around the globe, who create graphics suited to separate cultures.   The firm's instant messaging app is free to download, and 50 percent of the stickers are free. But the 50 percent that aren't free drive nearly all of the company's revenues, despite selling for less than two dollars per pack.        Here's what's trending on CNBC.com  The Asia Squawk Box team takes you through the latest top stories on CNBC.com.   Fledgling U.S. startup Messageme has also jumped on the bandwagon, as too has Facebook, which has started offering an array of free emojis and has integrated a \"sticker store\".  Tessa Mansfield, senior vice president at research firm Stylus, said that from a marketing perspective, the stickers were best used in promotions and merchandising, linked in with a new movie release or pop song.  \"The rise of stickers and emoticons is absolutely rooted in the ubiquity of the modern smartphone, and the emergence of a tech-literate generation of teenagers,\" she told CNBC.  \"This fun, quirky communication method has developed as a kind of 'digital slang' for young teens, delivering the rapid, image-led messaging mirrored in apps such as Snapchat. It also appeals to the desire to collect and accumulate - allowing teens to curate individual collections of special edition and celebrity-led stickers to personalize their digital conversations.\"  By CNBC.com's Matt Clinch.

Beaten down over the spring and summer, shares of Apple have upside potential in both the near- and long-term, Steve Milunovich of UBS said Wednesday.  \"Apple's like a fighter that's been taking punch after punch over the spring and summer, and finally it's going to start fighting back,\" he said. \"I think psychologically this stock could go higher.\"  Milunovich raised his Apple price target to $560 per share from $500 and kept his \"buy\" rating on the stock, largely on the expected strength of the iPhone 5C, the lower-cost version of its wildly popular smartphone.  On CNBC's \"Fast Money,\" he said that Apple was expected to ship 17 million iPhone units in fiscal 2014, with Asia's telecom behemoth China Mobile accounting for 10 percent of that total.  \"We're assuming most of those will be the 5C, the lower-end phone,\" he said. \"And we believe in general there's maybe 100 million people in China that can afford an Apple phone.\"  A deal with China Mobile could come by the end of 2013, Milunovich added.       Halftime Pops &amp; Drops  Insight on stocks making the biggest moves in the market today, with the Fast Money traders.   That, along with new products set to be unveiled next month, would create a short-term boost for the stock and a stronger long-term product.   \"I think the stock has a lot of wood to chop to get back toward that $700 level. You need to believe earnings are going to be $50 plus, not that far away. We're now at about $48 for fiscal '15,\" he said. \"Directionally, we do want to stay in the game. This is the time to own the stock, when you've got new products coming out. People are a bit skeptical. We think that this is a time to begin to buy Apple.\" Milunovich also weighed in on activist investor Carl Icahn's big bet on Apple, saying that his holdings amounted to less than 1 percent of outstanding shares.    \"Apple's relatively recently announced a $60 billion buyback. But the point is that they clearly do more,\" he said. \"We believe that they could easily increase their buyback by 50 percent, which would be accretive to earnings by about $2 per year. I just don't think having done something recently the company's going to feel the need to do more.\"  By CNBC's Bruno J. Navarro. Follow him on Twitter @Bruno_J_Navarro.

Since scaling to a five-year high of $95.45 in July, it's been all downhill since then as the stock has tumbled 9 percent.  Exxon's steep slide has cost investors in more ways than one. The oil big was once the world's most valuable company in terms of its market capitalization. Now, at $382 billion, Exxon's market capitalization is well behind technology giant Apple, which enjoys a market cap of about $458 billion.  Over the past 20 sessions, the energy giant has become the worst-performing component of the 30 blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow Jones industrial average.        ExxonMobil: Biggest loser in the Dow  \"Fast Money\" traders Joe Terranova and Stephanie Link debate whether ExxonMobil is still a buy as its earnings dropped 57 percent from last year. And Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank explains why he is \"very much on the sidelines of Exxon.\"    Exxon's point impact on the Dow over that period is second only to Chevron, the world's second-largest oil company: XOM has shaved approximately 52 points off the Dow while CVX has sliced more than 60 points off the index. Together, Exxon and Chevron accounted for 25 percent of the Dow's 565-point decline over the past 20 sessions. Although the U.S. is in the midst of an oil and gas renaissance that is transforming energy markets worldwide, that boom is largely dominated by small and midsize companies.  By CNBC's Javier E.

Stocks initially spiked lower following the minutes but rebounded within a half hour to wipe out all of the day's losses. Selling renewed aggressively into the close, with the major averages closing near session lows.          Name Price  Change %Change DJIA   ---   S&amp;P 500   ---   NASDAQ   ---     The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 105.44 points to close at 14,897.55, finishing below the psychologically-important 15,000 mark for the first time since July 3. Alcoa and Hewlett-Packard were the biggest Dow laggards.  The blue-chip index has plunged nearly 700 points, or approximately 4.5 percent, since hitting its record high of 15,658.36 on Aug. 2.  The S&amp;P 500 dropped 9.55 points to finish at 1,642.80. And the Nasdaq fell 13.80 points to end at 3,599.79,  The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, jumped near 16.

Mike Vogelzang, Boston Advisors; and Mark Martiak, Premier Financial Advisors, take a look at sectors that have been the best performers over the years including energy. They also pick sectors that will shine years from now.   Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting showed almost all the policymakers on the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee agreed that a change to the stimulus was not yet appropriate, though some hesitation remained. \"The Fed must be feeling significant political and global pressure to begin tapering because their language described in today's minutes release does not correspond to the current macro economic climate of the country,\" wrote Todd Schoenberger, managing partner at LandColt Capital. \"Bottom line: Wall Street traders are angry and confused by today's release.\"  Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields hit a fresh session high of 2.895 percent following the minutes. Yields have surged recently to two-year highs on expectations the Fed will soon slow its $85 billion monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Other assets around the world have also been hit, with riskier emerging markets getting especially hammered.          Fed impact on housing  Following the release of Fed minutes, Ken Rosen, of Rosen Consulting Group, joins Zane Brown, Lord Abbett; Gina Sanchez, Chantico Global; and CNBC's Steve Liesman, Bob Pisani and Rick Santelli to discuss the Federal Reserve's impact on the housing market.   Among earnings, Target declined after the retail giant warned its annual earnings will likely be near the lower end of its previous forecast as the company anticipates ongoing cautious consumer spending.  Staples plunged to lead the S&amp;P 500 laggards after the office supplies retailer posted earnings and revenue that missed projections, citing weakness in its retail stores and international operations.  American Eagle Outfitters dropped sharply after the teen apparel retailer issued disappointing guidance for the crucial back-to-school quarter. Additionally, the company said same-store sales will drop by a mid-to-high single digit percentage in the current quarter. Rivals Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Aeropostale also declined.  Meanwhile, Lowe's rallied to lead the S&amp;P 500 gainers after the home-improvement company topped quarterly expectations and boosted its full-year outlook. The news came a day after rival Home Depot posted strong earnings results.  Hewlett-Packard edged lower after the company reassigned Dave Donatelli, the executive vice president in charge of the firm's enterprise group to a new role. Donatelli's new role will be announced when the company posts its quarterly results after the closing bell.  L Brands, parent company of Victoria's Secret, is also slated to post earnings after the closing bell.  Apple climbed, bucking the downward trend of the broader markets, after UBS raised its price target on the iPhone maker to $560 from $500.  Goldman Sachs experienced a glitch on Tuesday that resulted in a large number of erroneous single stock and ETF options trades. Many of the trades may wind up being erased, but the error could still cost the firm over $100 million, according to a person familiar with the situation.  On the economic front, existing home sales jumped 6.5 percent in July to an annualized rate of 5.39 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Economists in a Reuters survey expected a total of 5.15 million annualized units versus 5.08 million annualized units in June.

Then let's look behind the scenes at the intensifying battle to fill Ben Bernanke's $3.6 trillion shoes. Larry Summers and Janet Yellen are duking it out, as the WaPo details.  Big business is a cutthroat world where sometimes the only rationale for doing something is to hurt the other guy. That may be the case with Apple's iTunes Radio, which Minyanville thinks is just for \"keeping its users from other Internet radio products.\"    When all was said and done, the prosecution of Bradley Manning for funneling confidential documents to WikiLeaks was \"a colossal waste of time,\" according to Time. Despite the 35-year sentence, Manning, 25, could be in his 30s by the time he gets out of prison, making him ripe to have his own intelligence-leaking reality show.  Well, as if you didn't know: Even with the supposedly anemic inflation level we've seen since the end of the Great Recession, most Americans have less buying power now than they did four years ago.  The Fed's likely reversal of its monetary easing is kicking the heck out of emerging market currencies and economies. Here's what tapering looks like from abroad.

Global data encouraging, Fed fears linger Economic data is what drove markets on Thursday. The latest jobless claims report showed a rise in initial claims to 336,000, a bit higher than the 330,000 economists were looking for. July leading indicators were better than expected and Markit's \"flash\" U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index posted its best showing since March. \"I do think the economy is in better shape than most people think, and that's why I think this setback over the last few days is a buying opportunity,\" Jim McCaughan of Principal Global Investors said.

European markets closed higher after Germany's PMI for August climbed in July. Broader euro zone PMI data also beat expectations. \"They're certainly good numbers, and we've been seeing this for the last four or five months in Europe,\" Richard Jerram, chief economist at the Bank of Singapore, told CNBC. \"It does seem that as the headwinds from fiscal tightening fade, then the economies are starting to lift.\"          Economy in better shape than people think: Expert  Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors CEO, explains why he thinks the U.S. economy is improving.  There remains ongoing uncertainty as to when the Fed will start tapering its massive stimulus program, however.

UBS economist Maury Harris told CNBC, \"The Fed is just apparently unable to send any kind of consistent message about what they're up to.\" Harris expects tapering to start in the fourth quarter, but it could be a \"tiny taper\" and \"hardly enough to make any kind of difference.\"  The annual Fed symposium will start in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Thursday evening.

For the remaining period of time, NASDAQ OMX, other exchanges, regulators and market participants coordinated with each other to ensure an orderly re-opening of trading in NASDAQ-listed securities.    Trading resumed and the balance of the trading day finished in normal course.    NASDAQ OMX will work with other exchanges that are members of the SIP to investigate the issues of today, and we will support any necessary steps to enhance the platform.    "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Jin Lee | Bloomberg | Getty Images    Nasdaq said it halted trading for three hours Thursday after a \"connectivity issue between an exchange participant\" and a system that disseminates all stock prices for the industry.  According to Nasdaq, the problem \"led to a degradation in the ability of the SIP to disseminate consolidated quotes and trades.\" Nasdaq did not identify which exchange had the issue connecting with the Securities Information Processor, also known as SIP. In its statement, it did say the \"cause of the issue has been identified and addressed.\"       Nasdaq: Identified &amp; addressed 'connectivity issue'  CNBC's Josh Lipton reports the Nasdaq has identified and addressed a connectivity issue in regards to today's trading glitch.   Nasdaq said once it became aware of the problem, it halted trading in all Nasdaq-listed securities to \"protect the integrity of the markets.\"  The SIP's technical issues were resolved in the first 30 minutes, Nasdaq added. The remaining time was needed to coordinate with other exchanges, regulators and market participants for an \"orderly re-opening\" of trading.  Trading resumed at 3:25 pm ET after the longest shutdown at the exchange in recent memory. It halted trading in such high-profile companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.  Despite the freeze, Nasdaq said that it would not cancel orders.   SEC Chair Mary Jo White said in a separate statement the \"serious\" interruption underlines the need to address \"technological vulnerabilities.\" The exchange closed at its normal time of 4 pm ET. Despite the troubles, stocks closed slightly up for the day.    There were reports Thursday morning that NYSE Euronext was telling traders its electronic exchange Arca was having technical issues with some Nasdaq-listed stocks. Nasdaq stopped routing orders to Arca temporarily, but reportedly the issues were resolved before Nasdaq halted all trading. Nasdaq officials would not comment when asked if the \"exchange participant\" that had the \"connectivity issue\" was Arca. The NYSE also had no comment. Once Nasdaq resumed trading, there were some technical issues when Arca went to reconnect, an NYSE spokesman said. He made the comment in response to a question before the latest Nasdaq statement.       Nasdaq 'flash freeze' fallout  A major technical glitch halted the Nasdaq this afternoon. The \"Fast Money\" traders and CNBC's Bertha Coombs and Bob Pisani.   The shutdown brought sometimes vehement criticism from across Wall Street. \"This is such an embarrassment to the entire financial community. To have the Nasdaq go down as it has; to be down three hoursit's one thing to be down for five minutesto be down for three hours is absolutely inexcusable,\" said Dennis Gartman, editor and publisher of The Gartman Letter.   \"It reminds me of sitting at the US Airways terminal and hearing nothing from nobody and you're getting angrier by the hour,\" he said. Former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt told CNBC: \"It looked like Nasdaq was clueless about how to deal with this emergency.\"  \"Nasdaq has, in my view, serious issues and there are two particular problems here. The first is, is there technology up to the task. That's number one and then the second is, that when technology goes bad, do they have an established crisis management program?,\" Pitt said.   Within an hour of the shutdown starting, the Nasdaq options markets issued a \"system update\" saying they were recommending firms route all open orders elsewhere. An average of 1.6 billion shares have been traded on the Nasdaq every day this August, according to statistics from Sandler O'Neill.        Nasdaq: Halts trading in all tape C securities  CNBC's Bob Pisani and Bertha Coombs report the Nasdaq has halted trading in options market as of 12:20p.   The New York Stock Exchange halted trading in all Nasdaq securities at its request and canceled orders. The NYSE otherwise declined comment. The CME said it saw 'no impact' from Nasdaq's trading halt.  \"You can't trade if you can't get the quotes out,\" said Rich Repetto of Sandler O'Neill Partners.   \"If I was back in the days of 10 years ago managing 300 traders I'd put the directive out to every one of them 'we don't put any orders in at the open' ... no one trades for 60 minutes,\" said Joe Terranova, chief market strategist for Virtus Investment Partners and a CNBC contributor.The shutdown of exchanges without an external crisis is rare, but a stray squirrel shut down the Nasdaq in 1987, according to the New York Times. - Written by CNBC's Matt Hunter and Alex Crippen.

"title": "As Nasdaq gets another black eye, industry under scrutiny", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Getty Images    Wall Street's latest trading fiasco is not expected to have a lingering impact on the market, but it certainly dealt a longer term blow to the Nasdaq's reputation. Trading in Nasdaq-listed stocks and options on those stocks were frozen for three hours Thursday, paralyzing a large cross section of the U.S. stock market. The financial hit to Nasdaq could be just several hundred thousand dollars in lost revenues, according to some analysts, but after its high-profile fumble trading the Facebook IPO, Nasdaq is under scrutiny, as is the entire market's vulnerability.   Such a noticeable technology breakdown on Wall Street is also another blow to investor confidence, shaken by the financial crisis but also by high speed trading and trading debacles, like the 2010 \"flash crash.\" Nasdaq is home to such high profile tech names as Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft.    Securities and Exchange Commissioner Mary Jo White weighed in Thursday evening, taking a hard tone. She said she would call a meeting of exchange leaders and other market participants and would push an SEC proposal for new standards for trading and other market systems. \"Today's interruption in trading, while resolved before the end of the day, was nonetheless serious and should reinforce our collective commitment to addressing technological vulnerabilities of exchanges and other market participants.\"  In the last several years, there have been a series of computer-related trading calamaties, including the most dramatic the \"flash crash,\" which sent the Dow into a rapid 1000 point decline, before it recovered. Glitches and failures large and small have occurred across the industry. The CBOE had a delayed opening in April for internal systems issues, and BATS Global Markets last year experienced a software glitch so severe that it canceled its IPO. A flawed Goldman Sachs computer system just this week generated a large amount of erroneous options trades.   This latest snafu, which occurred just after noon Thursday, was resolved within a half hour, according to Nasdaq, but it took the remaining time to coordinate with other exchanges, regulators and market participants to ensure the orderly re-opening of trading, Nasdaq said.  Traders complained that they received little information from Nasdaq while they waited for it to reopen. \"It's just frustrating. You can't get any answer from Nasdaq as to what actually happened,\" said Andy Stein, head of equity trading at Cowen, just after trading resumed at about 3:25 p.m. \"We have concern for any international orders we were working over the day.\"  Trading was slow once the market reopened. \"I think a lot of people stayed on the sidelines after they reopened the market,\" Stein said.   Steve Massocca of Wedbush Securities said the failure of exchange technology unfortunately is a trend that could continue. \"I just see it as part of the foreseeable future. I don't see it change. This is a recurring theme. These automated systems have issues on occasion,\" he said.        Death by regulations?  Discussing the Nasdaq's \"flash freeze,\" and whether The Regulatory Improvement Act will solve regulatory problems, with Thomas Stemberg, Staples founder and former CEO. Also, Stemberg answers whether a company like Staples could have been built in 2013.   The Nasdaq index was higher when the halt occurred and closed 38 points higher at 3638. The stock of exchange parent Nasdaq OMX stock wasn't so lucky, losing 3.4 percent on the day. The S&amp;P was up 14 points at 1656, just above its 50-day moving average, and the Dow was up 66 at 14,963.  Nasdaq said it halted trading after it became aware price quotes were not being disseminated by the Securities Industry Processor, basically a quote disseminator. Nasdaq is the operator of the SIP for the industry on its listed issues, while the NYSE operates SIPs for its stocks and ETFs.   \"If it was a Nasdaq problem with a Nasdaq system, the other exchanges could have kept trading the four-letter symbols but because the industry tape uses  price dissemination and Nasdaq operates it, they called a regulatory halt,\" said Richard Repetto, analyst with Sandler O'Neill. \"One interesting thing, it's not because the market is all fragmented. it's the one system that's not fragmented.\"  In the early evening Thursday, Nasdaq followed up with another statement, this time pointing to issues between an exchange participant and the SIP. \"There was a connectivity issue between an exchange participant and the SIP, which lead to a degradation in the ability of the SIP to disseminate consolidated quotes and trades. The cause of the issue has been identified and addressed,\" it said.  Nasdaq officials declined to comment beyond the statement.   Well before the Nasdaq halt, there were reports Thursday morning that NYSE Euronext was telling traders its electronic exchange Arca was having technical issues with some Nasdaq listed stocks. Nasdaq had stopped routing orders to Arca temporarily. But those issues were reportedly resolved before Nasdaq halted all trading. Once Nasdaq resumed trading, there were some technical issues when Arca went to reconnect, an NYSE spokesman said. He made the comment, in response to a question, before Nasdaq issued its statement.  \"The difference between Facebook and now, and everything we know about this, it doesn't look like there's big direct damage,\" said Repetto. \"They  shut down and they shut the entire industry down and people knew their positions. the direct monetary damages look limited at the moment. Its brand, its reputation and the listing business could see other indirect effects. The amount of people suing them is going to be limited. They shut the whole market down and they allowed people when they came up to cancel their bids.\"   As for trading Friday, Scott Redler of T3live.com said stocks could attempt to press higher again. \"We closed higher than where we were before the halt. That tells me this oversold bounce can continue,\" he said. \"For equities, it was almost like a yawner. It was ridiculous it took them three hours to get back up.\"  New home sales for July are reported at 10 a.m. ET.  Traders will also be watching the Fed Friday, as officials meet for their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will not be there, but other Fed officials are in attendance.  By CNBC's Patti Domm. Follow here on Twitter @pattidomm.  "

As the Nasdaq tries to figure out why it couldn't process trades for hours on Thursday, investors outside the exchange are trying to figure out what to name the event. Three years ago we had the Flash Crash. A year ago there was the Facebook Flub.  But this?  CNBC contributor Josh Brown suggests we call the meltdown \"The Flash Freeze,\" because what started as a flash froze ... all afternoon. How hard could it be to fix the problem? As @apsduke tweeted, \"NASDAQ I.T. head just has to answer 'my first pet's name?' \"       A lot of disgust from traders: Jeff Cox on Nasdaq  Troy Gayeski of Skybridge Capital and CNBC's Jeff Cox provide commentary on activity after Nasdaq's trading halt.   Perhaps the event deserves a name that encompasses all the problems in electronic trading recently. Even Hitler is shocked that such things could still happen in 2013. Yes, even before the shutdown was over, it had been parodied in the well-worn clip from \"Downfall.\" Click here to watch it.  This is a big deal. Trading in Apple stopped for three hours. No Apple for three hours. Panicked investors discovered for the first time that there are 499 other stocks in the S&amp;P 500.  So what to call it?

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  U.S. stock index futures signaled a flat to higher open on Friday a day after trading in Nasdaq securities was halted for more than three hours. Nasdaq OMX Group CEO Robert Greifeld told CNBC that the exchange has fixed the technical issues that led to Thursday's trading halt, but cannot guarantee there would be no future problems.. Microsoft shares are surging in early trading after the company said its CEO Steve Ballmer will retire within 12 months. He will remain CEO until a successor is named. The board has formed a special committee to consider both internal and external candidates.  The Federal Reserve will be in focus on Friday, with officials meeting for an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will not be present, but traders will still listen for any indication of when the central bank might start tapering its $85 billion per month asset purchases.    \"There is still some uncertainty as to whether the Fed will scale back QE3 [its third round of quantitative easing] in September or December, and how precisely tapering will be conducted,\" said Capital Economics' Jessica Hinds, in a research note.  Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart told CNBC that the data needs to show \"sustainable\" economic growth in order for the central bank to start cutting back on its monthly bond purchases. But he wouldn't rule out some sort of September move.   James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed, meanwhile, told CNBC the central bank should take its time and assess the situation before reducing stimulus. \"Inflation is running low, you've got mixed data on the economy, so I'd be cautious and I wouldn't want to pre-judge the meeting,\" he said.  Data out on Thursday pointed to improvement in the global economy. U.S. PMI posted its best showing since March, while euro zone PMI data also beat expectations. Both followed China's HSBC PMI figure, which hit a four-month high in August. The data helped push U.S. shares to a higher close, despite the Nasdaq trading halt.    On Friday, new home sales for July will be reported at 10 a.m. Any marked changes could move markets, as the Fed has said that its decision on when to start scaling back asset purchases will be based on U.S. economic indicators. Economists forecast a 1.4 percent drop to an annualized rate of 490,000 units in July, after an 8.3 percent rise in the previous month.  Turning to earnings reports, Pandora Media shares were falling after the company warned that earnings for fiscal 2014 would fall below analyst estimates as expenses to buy music rights and expand its sales personnel rise.  Retailers were also in focus again with solid results from Gap, Ann and Foot Locker and a weak print from Aeropostale.  Other stocks to watch on Friday include Apple, after billionaire investor Carl Icahn tweeted that Apple CEO Tim Cook was planning a bigger buyback. Icahn revealed last week that he had taken a large position in Apple, which is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion. In addition, several images were leaked on Thursday of what appears to be Apple's new line of iPhones.   Bank stocks will also be in focus, after Moody's Investors Service warned it might cut the credit ratings of the six biggest U.S. banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo saying the government may be unlikely to bail them out should they face trouble in the future.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Adam Jeffery | CNBC     A day after trading on the Nasdaq was halted for three hours, analysts say the stock exchange's credibility is likely to bear the brunt of the fall-out with the implications limited for broader trading in U.S. stocks.  Nasdaq on Thursday said a \"connectivity issue between an exchange participant\" had prompted it to stop trading. The trading halt was the longest shutdown at the exchange in recent memory, sparking confusion that impacted some of the biggest companies in the U.S. such as Apple and Facebook.   Analysts say Nasdaq will now have to work hard to restore its reputation as a stock exchange operator, with Thursday's incident following trading problems with the initial public offering  of Facebook in May last year.  \"This is an issue about the Nasdaq and how it can it compete against other exchanges it comes on top of the Facebook issue a while back,\" Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the consultancy The Lindsey Group, told CNBC Asia's \"Squawk Box.\"  \"If you're a company, you get to decide: do you want to list on the Nasdaq or the NYSE [New York Stock Exchange]? So from a competitive standpoint Nasdaq needs to do a lot of work to regain its reputation,\" he added.        What the Nasdaq freeze means for investors  Peter Boockvar, Chief Market Analyst at The Lindsey Group explains why Thursday's 3 hour closure on the Nasdaq won't hurt the exchange operator's share price too badly.   Shares of Nasdaq OMX, the company that operates the tech-heavy Nasdaq, fell to their lowest level since early May when trading on the exchange resumed on Thursday and closed more than 3 percent lower at $30.46.    \"Clearly the NYSE should benefit from this, but the NYSE is not fool-proof either as that also relies more on technology. So the NYSE should benefit from a reputational standpoint, but they've also had problems from a technical standpoint,\" Boockvar said.  The trading glitch comes at a bad time for financial markets, where trade has been volatile in recent months as investors anticipate a potential pull-back in the U.S. Federal Reserve's asset-purchase program aimed at supporting the economy.  \"The trading halt doesn't change our view on investing in the U.S. markets as we take a long-term view,\" Alex Friedman, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, told CNBC.  \"What it does do is hurt sentiment when you need sentiment to be heading in a positive direction. These things [technical problems] do happen in markets, so I don't think it's as big a deal as it seems right now,\" he added.  U.S. markets closed higher on Thursday, with all three major stock indices holding onto their gains after the Nasdaq re-opened from the trading halt. Asian markets were generally higher on Friday, suggesting the Nasdaq trading halt had limited impact on broader market sentiment.    \"Technical problems do happen. On a broader note, exchanges do need to look at how they can make trading more efficient,\" said David Poh, regional head of asset allocation at Societe Generale Private Banking.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  LOS ANGELES, Aug. 1, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- In today's complex global marketplace, the need for a truly masterful litigation attorney is clearer than ever. At the Los Angeles-based Adli Law Group, P.C., you'll find a team that includes an intellectual property attorney for nearly any company's patent, trademark and IP needs. Clients of the firm benefit from the world-class experience of founder Dr. Dariush Adli, Ph.D., Esq., who oversees a firm with impeccable skill in fields like patent, trademark, copyright, life sciences and entertainment law. That's why, for those seeking an entertainment lawyer that can also navigate the complexities of science and technology-related patents with efficiency and effectiveness, the legal counsel of Adli Law Group, P.C. is invaluable. When many entrepreneurs or inventors set out on achieving their goals, a common mistake is to assume ingenuity and ambition are enough to find success. While it's true that both those traits are necessary for any successful professional, the attorneys at Adli Law Group, P.C. know from firsthand experience that an expert knowledge of business law is also essential. No matter how effective or influential your company may be, without legal protection of one's ideas, logos and symbols, your company's products or message could be lost before ever reaching its intended audience. One recent case illustrating the complexities of patent and trademark law also deals with one of the most influential tech companies in the world today Apple Inc. This past spring, to the surprise of many, Apple was denied a patent for their iPad mini device. While the decision to grant Apple a trademark for their tablet device seemed clear after all, the iPad is already an iconic device for the renowned tech company. Yet, in a letter from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the tech giant was notified they would need to make it clear they seek only to trademark the term \"iPad mini\" and not the actual word \"mini.\" The disclaimer is designed to ensure that Apple won't attempt to deny other companies to use the descriptive term in the title of their own products. For a company with a reach as wide as Apple, the denial of their trademark request will likely serve as a minor hiccup, but for most companies, this delay could cause a great deal of stress and income lost. With the legal counsel of Adli Law Group, P.C., though, these sorts of crises can be handled efficiently and discreetly when they arise, or even before they come up at all.  Many were surprised to see this trademark denial leveled at such a high-profile company but such is the nature of trademark, patent and business law. Fortunately for their many professional clients, Adli Law Group, P.C. recruits only the highest caliber attorneys in order to assist companies ranging from small start-ups to multi-national Fortune 500 companies in a variety of modern business concerns. If you or your business is in need of the finest business expertise, contact the Los Angeles office of Adli Law Group, P.C. today at 1.800.817.2949 or visit them online at www.adlilaw.com.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "    CHICAGO, Aug. 2, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon.com Inc. , Netflix Inc , Apple Inc. , Credit Suisse Group AG  and The Blackstone Group L.P. .   Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.  Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:  Amazon to Produce 5 Kids Shows Amazon.com Inc.  announced that its film production division, Amazon Studios plans to produce pilots for 5 more original children shows in an effort to make its Prime Instant video service more attractive to its customers. These include Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street, a live-action adventure show, Grid Smasher, Hard-Boiled Eggheads, an animated action-comedy for the age group of 6-11, The Jo B. &amp; G. Raff Show and an animated series, Wishenpoof!. Management stated that all 5 pilots will be available on the Amazon Instant Video streaming service where viewers can watch them free of cost. Amazon Studios will take a call on which shows to produce going forward depending on viewer feedback. Amazon Instant Video is a digital video streaming and download service that lets users rent, buy or subscribe to a range of video content. These pilots will further extend the archive of children shows on Amazon's video streaming library, making it a significant force in the video streaming segment and increasing competition for Netflix Inc  and Apple Inc. . The completed pilots will be exclusively available to Prime members through Prime Instant Video and Lovefilm in the UK for no additional cost. Lovefilm is Amazon's European DVD and streaming movie service, which has almost 2 million subscribers. Recently, in June, Amazon had announced its decision to produce 5 original TV series from a group of 14 pilots that were earlier produced by its film production division, Amazon Studios. These 5 TV series, which include 2 comedy series and 3 children shows, will be available on the Amazon Instant Video streaming service later this year and in early 2014. In fact, many technology companies are getting into content production, including Hulu and Netflix, to reduce their reliance on traditional media companies. Amazon has been working on this for a while now and we believe these efforts will bring in millions of dollars and help the company to increase its market share. Amazon is one of the leading players in an extremely fast-growing market. In the second quarter, Amazon's top and bottom lines missed our expectations. The company is making huge investments in fulfillment and technology &amp; content, which might continue to impact the company's bottom line going forward. Currently, Amazon shares retain a Zacks Rank #5 . Credit Suisse to Vend Private Equity Unit In an attempt to discard its non-core businesses, Credit Suisse Group AG  plans to vend its private-equity unit Customized Fund Investment Group to Chicago-based Grosvenor Capital Management LP. The deal is expected to be announced at the end of the current week. The agreement is anticipated to be valued at an amount exceeding $200 million in the form of cash and other considerations that would comprise future payouts based on the performance of private-equity investments. Moreover, the agreement between Credit Suisse and Grosvenor Capital is yet to be finalized.  Like other banks, Credit Suisse has been affected by the implementation of new rules on capital requirements and investment activities. This has compelled the bank to shed its non-core business units in order to conform by stricter rules for managing capital and risk. Credit Suisse's private equity unit manages revenue-generating client assets invested in third-party private equity funds and collects fees on these assets. At present, Credit Suisse manages revenue-generating assets worth $20 billion. Additionally, it has $10 billion in commitments and other assets.  On the other hand, Grosvenor Capital, a privately owned investor in hedge funds, oversees client assets invested in hedge funds worth $23 billion. On successful completion of this transaction, Grosvenor Capital's client assets are expected to double in size, thereby expanding the company's business.  Of late, Credit Suisse has been shedding its private-equity units that allocate money to hedge funds and other investment managers. Earlier in Apr 2013, Credit Suisse declared its intention to sell its secondary private equity business, Strategic Partners, to The Blackstone Group L.P. . The deal, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2013, is subject to customary closing conditions.  Upon completion, the deal is expected to reduce Credit Suisse's expenses. Moreover, by discarding its non-core businesses, the company will be able to focus more on its core operations. Additionally, it would help the firm in fulfilling the stringent regulatory requirements. Credit Suisse currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 .

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  HOUSTON---- With Apple  reportedly looking into acquiring a 3D printing company, Quantum International Corp.  is well positioned for growth as it continues exploring the innovative three-dimensional printing technology for the manufacturing of its iPad case.  3D printing has gained momentum over the last 18 months as innovators discover the best ways to use the latest additive manufacturing technology to print everything from small toys to large buildings. The market topped $2 billion in revenues in 2012 and, with projections topping $5 billion in less than three years, 3D printing is an industry that technology giants such as Apple are said to be currently exploring.

According to the industry specific Wohlers Report 2013, the market for 3D printing in 2012, consisting of all products and services worldwide, grew 28.6 percent  to $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion in 2011 when it grew 29.4 percent.

"title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights:Google, Apple, Earthlink, Facebook and Everest Re Group", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  CHICAGO, Aug. 5, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Google Inc. , Apple Inc , Earthlink , Facebook  and Everest Re Group, Ltd. .   Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:  Google's First Smartphone: Moto X In order to gain traction in the hardware market, Google Inc.'s  Motorola Mobility introduced its new smartphone, Moto X, which is expected to be released in the U.S. by the end of this month. Following the news, Google's share price surged 1.86%. Moto X is the first smartphone designed by Motorola since it was acquired by Google. Powered by its Android OS, Moto X will come with a 4.7 inch display, better screen resolution, a camera designed for a quick boot-up and a better battery life. Features in the Moto X include design customization options whereby users can personalize their handset with their choice of colors and materials. It also has a Touchless Control feature, which uses Google Voice to add voice-recognition capabilities and turns on the phone even without touching. The phone will cost $199 with a two-year contract and be available on all four major U.S. carriers and US Cellular. Google had bought Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2012 and stated that it would continue to run as a separate unit, with its phones based on the Android OS. The deal was the biggest in its 13-year history and propped up Google's portfolio with more than 17,000 patents. To Google's misfortune, Motorola has been continuously losing market share to its competitors and has been unable to regain it. In the last couple of years, the once-significant cell phone maker, Motorola Mobility, fell behind in the competitive smartphone market, which is now dominated by Apple Inc's  iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy range, which runs on Google's Android platform. According to a report by research firm IDC, Android and Apple's iOS operating systems together held approximately 92.3% of smartphone market share in the first quarter of 2013. Moreover, Apple and Samsung together hold a 62.2% share of the U.S. smartphone market, while Motorola has a mere 7.8%, which was down 7.1% from the prior quarter. As a result, it becomes important for Motorola to introduce competitive products that can address the needs of its target market. We believe that the Moto X features position the phone at the lower end and expect Google to come up with better versions as time goes by.. At any rate, Motorola still has some way to go to retain its lost glory. Google is a market leader in online advertising and its mobile strategy has been bang on target so far. Its Android OS has gone a long way toward cementing its position in the mobile segment. However, the Motorola hardware segment has not done well. In the last quarter, the segment was down 2.0% sequentially and accounted for around 7% of revenues. Management did not say much about Motorola's future plans. Google currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 . Stocks that have been performing well in its sector and are worth considering include Earthlink  and Facebook . While Earthlink carries a Zacks Rank #2 , Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #1 . Everest Re Ratings Affirmed Last week the rating agency, A.M. Best affirmed the issuer credit ratings  of \"a-\" of Everest Re Group, Ltd. . The company's debt ratings were also affirmed along with the ratings of its subsidiaries. All the ratings carry a Stable outlook. This rating affirmation indicates Everest Re's strong balance sheet profile and better-than-average underwriting performance, along with its ability to perform favorably amidst tough market conditions, a seasoned management team and huge market share in the insurance and reinsurance industry. Everest Re has adequate capital flexibility, which shields the company from market uncertainties. Moreover, its combined ratio, signifying an insurer's profitability, remained below the breakeven levels over the past decade. The company also has a liquid investment portfolio that has a short duration maturity. It has kept its investment portfolio conservative by investing just 10% of the total investment money in equities. A low incidence of equity in the investment portfolio will protect the company from equity market volatility. The company has also successfully increased its cash flows year-over- year. The rating agency noted that Everest is well-run by a seasoned and experienced management team, which has kept the company's operating costs under control and successfully delivered underwriting profitability year after year. The company is also well-diversified across different regions with a wide product portfolio, which helps it to garner a greater market share. The rating agency also praised Everest Re for managing its enterprise risk effectively over the years. The company's effective risk management capability has helped it to reduce risk across its business, and at the same time enabled it to allocate capital efficiently. Nevertheless, factors negating the positives include Everest Re's exposure to catastrophe losses, which impart volatility to its earnings. Though the company uses catastrophe models and has maintained risk limits to control catastrophe losses, occurrence of such incidents reduce the company's earnings.  Everest Re also carries net asbestos and environmental  exposure of approximately $426 million, which has been going down recently. Reserves against these policies are monitored on a quarterly basis and the current review shows that the company has adequate reserves against these liabilities. Going forward, the rating agency is likely to give a positive review to Everest Re's ratings if it continues to deliver consistent underwriting profitability as well as maintain strong capital profile. However, reduced profitability and capital levels, along with greater-than-expected exposure to catastrophe loss and declining capital reserves may compel the agency to provide a negative rating.  Everest Re currently retains a Zacks Rank #2.  Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.

Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro offers the latest 3D modeling, visualization and cloud-based collaboration technologies to help efficiently close the estimated $30 trillion gap worldwide between desperately needed infrastructure and the funding required to deliver it.  The ability to rapidly produce proposals by creating and aggregating project information, which can then be viewed within the InfraWorks environment as it might appear in the real world, helps make Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro a powerful tool for winning new business and accelerating the project approval process. Shown here is an Autodesk InfraWorks model of San Francisco's Presidio Parkway roadway accessed via the cloud and being reviewed on an Apple iPad. Image courtesy of Autodesk.   To expand access to the critical BIM solutions that design professionals need to address this challenge, the new solution is available via a quarterly plan, making it ideal for firms to test-drive Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro, or use it for short-term project needs.  Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro enhances BIM workflows by providing desktop software and cloud-based capabilities that enable multi-discipline infrastructure project stakeholders in geographically dispersed offices to publish, store, collaborate and manage large models centrally in the cloud via desktop or mobile devices. The ability to rapidly produce proposals by creating and aggregating project information, which can then be viewed within the InfraWorks environment as it might appear in the real world, helps make Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro a powerful tool for winning new business and accelerating the project approval process.  The must-have technologies weve combined to create Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro are fundamentally transforming the way projects are completed by accelerating the ability to quickly design, collaborate and visually communicate design intent via 3D models created at the beginning of an infrastructure projects lifecycle, said Amar Hanspal, senior vice president, IPG Product Group, Autodesk. With Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro, we can now bring the power of Autodesk InfraWorks to users who may have been concerned about committing to a long-term purchase or subscription.  As more civil engineers embrace 3D modeling techniques and adopt BIM workflows, the use of design-time visualization to improve infrastructure project outcomes is growing, said Jeff Lyons, business unit leader of the AEC Solutions Group at Cole Engineering. For example, we recently won a major water distribution project thanks to the ability to quickly create and share compelling 3D visualizations using Autodesk InfraWorks cloud-enhanced technologies.  Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro contains breakthrough 3D modeling and visualization technology that goes beyond traditional computer-aided design  by helping users quickly create compelling simulations and visualizations of design alternatives. With its ability to import a variety of existing conditions data including GIS, satellite imagery, and point clouds , Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro helps make it possible to design within the context of real site conditions from the start of a project lifecycle.  Users of Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro will benefit from newly released capabilities for the desktop software that include enhanced terrain grading and shaping to help users easily create and maintain level sites, as well as near-photorealistic rendering that allows users to apply high quality graphics or choose faster rendering to more quickly navigate large models.  Cloud for Collaboration and Computational Intensive Jobs  Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro leverages the power of the cloud to transform the way infrastructure professionals manage big data, create 3D models and collaborate on infrastructure projects. Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pros cloud-based technology provides nearly anywhere, anytime access via desktop or mobile devices for stakeholders to view and/or collaborate on project models. To help users quickly and easily access and download the data they need to build site-specific models, a link for direct access to a curated WeoGeo.com portal comes with Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro enabling customers to access and acquire free or for-purchase geospatial data. In addition, computationally intensive processes, such as analysis, simulation and rendering of high resolution models, can be performed using the virtually unlimited power of the cloud.  Pricing and Availability  Autodesk InfraWorks 360 Pro will be available in this month for purchase on a quarterly basis, which includes 150 cloud credits . To accommodate long or short project needs, users have the flexibility to renew at the end of each quarter.

"content": "  ALEXANDRIA, Va., Aug. 6, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- In new videos and a game launched today on www.NSTeens.org, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and Sprint  are challenging tweens  to think about the choices they're making online. The new content added to the free Internet-safety site tackles issues like cyberbullying and online enticement. Its goal is to empower kids to be safer and smarter online. \"Recent studies have found that most children are using the Internet every day by age 8. As they get older the amount of time spent online will only increase,\" said John Ryan, CEO of NCMEC. \"We have to help our kids understand, from a young age, that what they are doing online can have a lasting impact on their lives. Threats from potential predators are real, but kids also have to consider how they will react to cyberbullying and what they are leaving online for people like college admission officers and employers to see. With Sprint's help, we're asking kids to think, not just about their safety, but about the kind of people they want to be online.\" The new content available today includes: 6 Degrees of Information, a video that asks teens to think about the information they share online and how comfortable they are with people finding it. In the video, Matt, an Internet researcher, asks five teens to participate in an experiment where he will try to find out as much as he can about them online in just six clicks.  Rescue Run, a new game where players must avoid obstacles while racing to stop their friends from meeting face-to-face with people they first met online. During the game, players receive tips about how to handle requests to meet offline. Tweens can play at NSTeens.org or download the mobile version from the Apple iTunes stores or the Google Play Android store.  Stand By or Stand Up?, the first interactive, role-playing comic on NSTeens.org. The comic addresses cyberbullying and engages tweens through a \"choose-your-own-adventure\" style of story in which their decisions help shape the comic's outcome. The new content, along with previous Internet-safety games and videos, is available for free at www.NSTeens.org. The site also includes activity cards and discussion guides to help educators and parents engage tweens in a dialogue about the issues.  \"Sprint is committed to addressing the impacts of an increasingly connected and mobile society,\" said Debby Ballard, director of Community Affairs for Sprint. \"When we see statistics that tell us 95 percent of all teens are online and 80 percent are users of social media sites, we have to pay attention to the potential risks that come along with navigating an expansive online world. At Sprint, we believe it is more important than ever to make sure that our products and services are being used in the safest manner possible, particularly when in the hands of those who may be the most vulnerable. Together with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, we provide free resources to educators, parents and young people nationwide so that working, learning and playing online can be a safe experience. \" NCMEC and Sprint launched www.NSTeens.org in 2007. It is part of NCMEC's popular Internet safety resource, NetSmartz Workshop . It is funded as part of Sprint's Internet safety initiative, 4NetSafety , through Sprint's charitable phone-recycling program, Sprint Project Connect. 4NetSafety is an important part of Sprint Good Works, an initiative that encompasses Sprint's community and philanthropic outreach across the country.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  DALLAS, Aug. 8, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- There's a lot more to Hollywood magic than smoke and mirrors popular movie and TV shows about zombies, superheroes, spaceships and true crime only come to life because of science, technology, engineering and math . To view the multimedia assets associated with this release, please click: http://www.multivu.com/mnr/54048-texas-instruments-stem-behind-hollywood-program-with-mayim-bialik That's why Texas Instruments  is launching \"STEM Behind Hollywood,\" an exciting new education program developed with assistance from The Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange, a program of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as actress, neuroscientist and STEM education advocate Mayim Bialik.  Aimed at getting middle and high school students excited about STEM subjects and careers, \"STEM Behind Hollywood\" makes math and science come to life in a series of free online classroom activities available at www.stemhollywood.com that help teachers demonstrate the real-world concepts behind four popular Hollywood themes: Zombies, Space, Superheroes and Forensics. Each activity can be downloaded to the TI-Nspire CX graphing calculator, Student Software or TI-Nspire Apps for iPad, allowing students to visualize and interact directly with sci-fi influenced representations of the math and science to gain a deeper understanding of the real-world concepts. \"We are helping teachers draw young people into STEM by showing the 'cool factor' of real-life science and math behind the magic they see in movies and on TV,\" said Melendy Lovett, president of Texas Instruments Education Technology. \"We are very excited to work with The Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange and our STEM education brand ambassador Mayim Bialik on this initiative to capture students' imaginations and cultivate a lifelong interest in STEM subjects and careers.\" These activities were developed with the help of scientists and experts from The Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange who consult on Hollywood films and TV shows to ensure the accuracy of science and mathematics depicted on screen. And Bialik, who is not only the Emmy-nominated actress portraying a scientist on The Big Bang Theory but is also a scientist in real life, helps students make the connection between what they see on screen and real concepts. \"The Science and Entertainment Exchange is a nonprofit outreach of the National Academy of Sciences that brings scientists and entertainers together to make the movie magic as realistic as possible,\" said Rick Loverd, Program Director of The Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange. \"When entertainers have questions about anything from robotics to physics to genetics as they're making feature films, TV and videogames, we'll bring in field experts who can help them develop whole worlds and characters and stories with real science behind them. One of our goals of this effort is to inspire the next generation of kids into STEM careers, and Texas Instruments' approach to getting kids engaged in math and science by using Hollywood as an entry point, it's really exciting.\"  In the first activity, Zombies, Bialik teams up with Steven C. Schlozman, PhD, Harvard Medical School professor and renowned author of \"The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks from the Apocalypse,\" to help students explore several real-life scenarios of math and science including what factors would impact the outbreak and spread of a \"zombie pandemic,\" much like the plot of the summer's blockbuster film World War Z, and what a \"zombie brain\" teaches about a real, healthy human brain's functions.  \"It's important to know zombies aren't real but that doesn't mean we can't think out loud in the classroom about what makes them sick and have teachable moments with students on epidemiology and neurology,\" said Dr. Schlozman. \"This first activity takes scary, real-life scenarios like avian flu or Ebola outbreaks and turns it into something we can talk about and have some fun with, while still learning and exploring some very serious science concepts.\" In addition to Zombies, \"STEM Behind Hollywood\" activities will feature themes of Space, Superheroes and Forensics with the help of noted field experts, including: Space: Dr. Randii R. Wessen, Senior Technical Staff at the Jet Propulsion Lab  Innovation Foundry  Superheroes: Jim Kakalios, PhD, University of Minnesota professor, author of The Physics of Superheroes, and Exchange consultant for Watchmen and Green Lantern  Forensics: Diane L. France, Ph.D., D-ABFA, Forensic Anthropologist and Director of the Human Identification Laboratory of ColoradoTeachers, students and parents can visit www.stemhollywood.com to learn more about the \"STEM Behind Hollywood\" program, access the free activities, and sign up to receive notifications when new activities are available.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  SEATTLE---- U.S. District Court Judge William H. Orrick has rejected Apples  attempt to disqualify intellectual property law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP from representing Flatworld Interactives, LLC in a patent lawsuit alleging that Apples devices infringe patents relating to touchscreens.  Apple leveled a series of accusations again Hagens Berman, including a charge that an attorney working for a firm employed by Apple passed confidential information to Hagens Berman attorneys. The company and its attorneys asked the judge to disqualify Hagens Berman from representing Flatworld in its lawsuit due to an alleged conflict of interest.  In his ruling, handed down Aug. 7, 2013, Judge Orrick dismissed this claim among others concluding that Hagens Berman did not receive confidential information from McAleese that enabled it to gain an advantage in the litigation.  Apple concocted a witchs brew of allegations, comprised of half-truths, conjecture and leaps of dubious logic, said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman. We are grateful that Judge Orrick saw the claims for what they were and dismissed them.  Berman noted that his firm will seek a Rule 11 sanction, which allows a court to punish attorneys who submit pleadings that contain frivolous arguments.  We told Apple that the claims were without merit, illustrated that to them in our pleading and told them if they persisted, we would seek sanctions, and that is what intend to do, Berman said.  Berman also noted that since the ruling, Apple has hired another firm to join its already large legal team in defending the claim. We have gone toe-to-toe with Apple and bested them at each turn, he said. We dont believe that adding a hundred additional attorneys will make a whit of difference; the facts of the case will carry the day.  Apples motion came just before a crucial Markman hearing, in which the terms in the patent would be construed by the judge.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Pandora Media, Inc. , Ford Motor Co. , SIRIUS XM Radio Inc. , Apple Inc.  and Monsanto Company .   Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.  Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:  Rising Demand for Pandora in U.S. Pandora Media, Inc.  continues to gain popularity in the U.S. on the back of solid growth of Internet radio listeners. The launch of innovative products and services coupled with improving car sales has resulted in such robust growth. Based in Oakland, CA, Pandora provides Internet radio services in the U.S. Recently, Pandora Media reported key audience metrics for the month of July, wherein hours listened to Pandora music increased 14% to 1.28 billion hours from the prior-year period. Moreover, active audience for the month was 71.2 million, up 30% year over year. Such massive growth of listeners has driven the company's share of in the total U.S. radio audience to 7.08% against 6.13% in the same month last year.  During the second quarter of 2014, the total audience listening to Pandora music was 3.88 billion as compared with 3.3 billion in same period last year, while average active listeners during the same period was 71.03 million against 54.9 million in the second quarter of 2013. To tap the automobile market, Pandora is continuously forming strategic partnerships with automobile companies as people usually listen to music while driving. Pandora started with radio system installation in Ford Motor Co.  in 2010 and has already installed it in more than 100 vehicles.  The company believes that the current fiscal year will be profitable as it expects at least 33% of the total cars sold in the country to have Pandora radios. Two months back, Pandora introduced a new service through which people can listen to radio at home through multiple devices. Through tv.pandora.com one can easily connect any gaming consoles or TV to listen to music.  Hence, we believe that such strategic moves undertaken by the company will not only boost its Pandora fan base but will also help the company to take an unprecedented lead over popular radio service providers like SIRIUS XM Radio Inc.  and Apple Inc. . Apple Inc.'s upcoming iTunes online radio service will offer hands-free voice control in automobiles. Currently, Pandora has a Zacks Rank #3 .  Monsanto Hikes Dividend 14.7% Monsanto Company , an agricultural products manufacturer, has recently announced a quarterly dividend hike. The company will be utilizing its free cash to boost stakeholders' returns. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 14.7% to 43 cents  from 37.5 cents a share . The increased dividend will be paid on Oct 25, 2013, to shareholders of record as of Oct 4. This is the fourth dividend hike by Monsanto since 2010, which has resulted in a cumulative increase of roughly 60%. Monsanto last hiked its quarterly dividend to 37.5 cents from 30 cents in Aug 2012, reflecting an increase of 25%. Monsanto has been rigorously taking steps to increase shareholders' values. In June this year, the company announced a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, spread over three years.  The company's commitment toward increasing shareholders' returns reflects its free cash flow-generating capability, sound liquidity position and defined future prospects. Monsanto boasts a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion, exiting the third quarter of fiscal 2013. The company expects to generate high cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion for full fiscal 2013. Looking ahead, the company remains confident of its growth potential, suggesting enhanced value for shareholders. We expect Monsanto to benefit from the rise in the corn seed portfolio pricing in fiscal 2014, leading to higher revenues.  Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ShoreTel reports all required financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States , but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult to understand if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Many investors have requested that ShoreTel disclose this non-GAAP information because it is useful in understanding the company's performance as it excludes non-cash charges, other non-recurring adjustments and related tax adjustments, that many investors feel may obscure the company's true operating performance. Likewise, management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider stock-based compensation charges and amortization charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets, which are non-cash charges, or other non-recurring items in managing its core operations. ShoreTel has provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures following the text of this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  JERSEY CITY, N.J., Aug. 9, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- ANTENNA, the authority on enterprise mobility, today announced it has been positioned by Gartner, Inc. in the \"Leaders\" quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms  for the second consecutive year. Antenna is the only company listed in the report that has been positioned as a leader in mobile application platform Magic Quadrants  four out of the last five years.[i] Antenna's positioning by Gartner is based on its completeness of vision and ability to execute. The company also believes it is a reflection of its agility both from a product and company standpoint. As the mobile channel has become more of a strategic priority for businesses in recent years, Antenna has continually evolved its products and services in anticipation of growing market demand and more rigorous enterprise requirements. Since 1998 Antenna has helped companies mobilize their business, and with the most recent version of AMPchroma, the company's flexible and scalable mobility Platform-as-a-Service, it is easier than ever for global 1000 organizations to build and manage mobile applications with Antenna.  According to the report, \"Selecting mobile application development platforms  has become an urgent issue for many CIOs. Less than seven years after the introduction of Apple's iPhone, the worldwide installed base of smartphones and tablets will surpass that of PCs in 2013. As a result, mobile technologies ranked as a top technology priority in Gartner's last three annual CIO surveys. Building mobile applications is an important component of an enterprise's mobile strategies, because applications provide much of the potential business return on investments in mobile infrastructure. Enterprises build mobile websites and apps to engage customers wherever they are. Similarly, they build mobile applications to improve employee efficiency and effectiveness. However, selecting a MADP is not easy.\"[ii] \"Last year we witnessed a true sea change in the enterprise mobility marketplace with a flood of both large and small companies entering the red-hot mobile applications market. Gartner has the unenviable task of sifting through this large and complex ecosystem and helping its clients identify the right partner for the right job,\" said Jim Hemmer, president and CEO of Antenna Software. \"We are thrilled that the firm has once again recognized Antenna as a leader in its MADP market assessment, and we believe this cements our understanding of an ever-changing market, and our ability to deliver a flexible, end-to-end mobile platform that enterprises want and need.\"  To download a complimentary copy of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms report, please click here or go to http://bit.ly/MQMADP13.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  LONDON, August 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- We asked 500 of our students two simple questions: where do you study with EF Englishtown now, and where would you like  to learn?   Answers to the first question weren't that surprising: 70% currently studied at home, 15% in bed  and 12% managed to study at work. However, when we asked where our students would like to do their studying, the responses changed dramatically. They ranged from the pragmatic - 30% want to study on their way to work and 21% on a plane - to the exotic: 30% want to study on a lounge chair on a beach in the Maldives and 20% whilst relaxing on a slow boat. Especially creative responses included the desire to study in the Tibetan mountains, at Times Square or the Grand Canyon and, well, on the moon! Learning on public transport and beyond: the world is your oyster The common denominator, whether the answer was practical or aspirational  is that people want to fit learning around their lifestyles. Now they can. Today EF Englishtown is launching an Android tablet app to complement the existing EF Efekta 13 iPad app launched in 2012. There are a lot of language learning apps on the market, but ours is different. It isn't just courseware, it includes teacher-led classes that set us apart from our competitors and help students to communicate at a much quicker rate. The app also functions online or offline so progress isn't interrupted when you go through a tunnel, when the seat belt sign comes on or when you've managed to get away from it all to a truly remote location like Mount Everest base camp! If this story piques your interest, why not see what all the fuss is about? If you would like a free trial of the app, simply email EFEnglishtown.Press@ef.com and we will set you up. It's EF Englishtown, and it's based wherever you are. The Android tablet App launches today. About EF Englishtown EF Englishtown is the world's largest and most trusted online English school. Originating from a collaboration between Apple Computer and EF Education First, EF Englishtown has reinvented the way busy people learn English by pioneering 24 hour, teacher-led online learning.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  DUBLIN---- Research and Markets  has announced the addition of the \"Global Data Center VOD Market 2012-2016\" report to their offering.  The analysts forecast the Global Data Center Video on Demand  market to grow at a CAGR of 13.87 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increasing demand for HD programming and on-demand content. The Global Data Center VOD market has also been witnessing innovation in server technology. However, inefficient streaming of VOD content due to limited bandwidth could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.  The key vendors dominating this space include ARRIS Group Inc., Concurrent Computer Corp., Dell Inc., EMC Corp., Harmonic Inc., Harris Corp., HP Co., IBM Corp., NetApp Inc., and SeaChange International Inc.  The other vendors mentioned in this report are Alcatel-Lucent SA, Apple Inc., Blinkbox, Cisco Systems Inc., Comcast Corp., Edgeware, Espial Group Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., Google Inc., Grass Valley USA LLC, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Hulu.com, LOVEFiLM.com, Motorola Mobility Inc., Netflix Inc., Panasas Inc., RGB Networks, Thomson Video Networks, Verizon FIOS, and ZTE Corp.

Netflix and LoveFilm offer unlimited online streaming videos for a subscription of a few dollars a month. Users can also rent unlimited DVDs per month for a very low subscription. Moreover, games on-demand has a very strong growth potential. The set-top box is becoming popular, and operators have started to cover games in their packages.

Kids are permanently attached to their electronics - but far too many have experienced that heart-sinking moment when their device falls into the toilet between classes, gets caught up in a soda spill over lunch, or is dropped down the stairs during a mad dash to football practice. With so many devices lost to split second accidents, it's a good idea to protect them from the unexpected: drinks, food, dirt and drops. With LifeProof cases for both Apple and Android, parents can feel confident sending their student back to school with the latest and greatest smartphone or tablet, knowing that their investment is safe in the classroom, on campus and everywhere in between.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  New cross-platform notification service is a fast, scalable and cost-effective way for mobile apps to proactively keep their users aware of critical events and relevant information  SEATTLE---- Amazon Web Services, Inc. , an Amazon.com company , today announced Amazon Simple Notification Service  with Mobile Push, a fast, fully managed, cross-platform push notification service in the cloud. With one simple API, application developers can easily send notifications to Apple iOS, Google Android and Kindle Fire devices. All AWS customers can begin using Mobile Push for Amazon SNS at no charge and send up to one million notifications each month for free. After that, customers pay $.50 for every million messages published, and $.50 for every million messages delivered . To learn more about Amazon SNS Mobile Push, visit: http://aws.amazon.com/sns.  Supporting push notifications at large scale has been incredibly complicated for mobile app developers. Each popular mobile platform maintains a different free relay service that delivers notifications through persistent connections to devices running the platforms they own. This means that to support millions of users on multiple mobile platforms, developers must integrate with each of these platform-specific relay services, which introduces operational complexity and cost. In addition, the nature of mobile app distribution is such that successful apps can become popular almost overnight, exacerbating these challenges for customers.  Many customers tell us they build and maintain their own mobile push services, even though they find this approach expensive, complex and error-prone, said Raju Gulabani, Vice President of Database Services, AWS. Amazon SNS with Mobile Push takes these concerns off the table with one simple cross-platform API, a flat low price and a free tier that means many customers wont pay anything until their applications achieve scale.  Crittercism is a mobile application performance management company. \"Crittercism helps companies of all sizes monitor their apps performance and identify problems as theyre happening, but quickly communicating to large user bases has always been a challenge for the mobile industry, said Andrew Levy, CEO of Crittercism. AWS services like DynamoDB and now SNS Mobile Push are key building blocks that help us deliver the best experience possible across 600 million mobile devices. SNS Mobile Push means our customers can now notify tens of millions of users in a matter of seconds about critical app performance issues.  Urban Airship offers market-leading advanced services for some of the worlds biggest brands to build relationships using push notifications, and Amazon is a key partner for us, said Scott Kveton, CEO of Urban Airship. We've supported push on the Kindle since it first launched, and we employ AWS heavy lifting to support many of our services today. Leveraging AWS allows us to continue to focus on delivering great mobile experiences. The raw transmission of push notifications is itself a heavy workload - AWS has proven it can handle huge-scale workloads.  WeatherBug customers expect immediate notification of alerts anywhere in the world, on any platform and on any device,\" said Thomas Spendley, Vice President of Engineering of Earth Networks. \"In the past, we built the push service for each specific mobile platform but it was expensive and time-consuming. Amazon SNS with Mobile Push is an easy choice because it is both less expensive  than our self-managed service was, and also saves us valuable time that we can reinvest into other priorities.  Amazon SNS with Mobile Push can send messages to individual users on specific devices or broadcast identical messages to many subscribers at once, and can easily scale from a few notifications a day to hundreds of millions. Mobile Push is built into Simple Notification Service, which developers already use to notify their customers via SMS text message and e-mail. With Amazon SNS with Mobile Push, developers can focus on engaging their customers instead of the devices those customers happen to choose. Amazon SNS with Mobile Push is available in all public AWS regions. To get started visit: http://aws.amazon.com/sns.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  DUBLIN---- Research and Markets  has announced the addition of the \"Global Education PC Market 2012-2016\" report to their offering.  The analysts forecast the Global Education Personal Computer  market to grow at a CAGR of 12.08 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the need for creative and innovative learning in the Education industry. The Global Education PC market has also been witnessing an increasing use of tablet devices in the education vertical. However, the shrinking education IT budget could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.  The key vendors dominating this space include Acer Group, Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Lenovo Group Ltd.  The other vendors mentioned in this report are Acer Group, Aleutia Ltd., AMAX Information Technologies Inc., Apple Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., AXIOO International, BenQ Corp., Concurrent Technologies, Dell Inc., Elitegroup Computer Systems Co.

Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: One of the main trends witnessed in the Global Education PC market is increase in usage of tablets in the education vertical. Tablets have changed the way by which teachers interact with their students. Tablets allow storing a large volume of information that a student can have an access to at any time. At a secondary or higher education level, tablets reduce the need for a student to refer to many textbooks for each subject. Moreover, with the increasing number of applications being developed that focuses on the Education vertical, teachers can engage students with interesting educational applications.  According to the report, one of the main factors driving the market is the need for creative and innovative learning. In recent times, creativity in the learning process has become extremely essential.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  DUBLIN---- Research and Markets  has announced the addition of the \"Global Semiconductor Foundry Market 2012-2016\" report to their offering.  One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the customer's need to restock inventory. The Global Semiconductor Foundry market has also been witnessing an increased adoption of expansion strategies. However, the fluctuating revenue of the Semiconductor market could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.  The key vendors dominating this space include GlobalFoundries Inc., Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., and United Microelectronics Corp.  The other vendors mentioned in this report are Apple Inc., Dongbu HiTek Co. Ltd., IBM Microelectronics, Magnachip Semiconductor Corp., Powerchip Technology Corp., Samsung Semiconductor Inc., Tower Semiconductor Ltd. , Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp., and WIN Semiconductors Corp .  Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The Global Semiconductor Foundry market is witnessing an increasing consolidation and strategic alliances between market players, which are expected to continue even in the future. Both existing vendors and new entrants prefer the acquisitive route to either enter the market or broaden their portfolio of offerings. For instance, Hua Hong NEC Electronics and Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. completed their merger in 2011. In addition, IBM, Global Foundries, and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. have formed an alliance in the market. Since the market is highly fragmented and competitive, players are adopting strategies such as alliances, agreements, and mergers to sustain the competition.  According to the report, one of the main drivers is the restocking of inventory by customers. As the demand for semiconductor devices is increasing, customers are replenishing the stock to keep pace with the current as well as near-future market conditions. For the past few years, this has been one of the major contributing factors to the growth of the market.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  NEW YORK, Aug. 14, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Snap Interactive, Inc.  , a leading social dating developer, today announced financial and operational results for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. On a sequential basis, total revenues for the second quarter of 2013 decreased 9% to $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $3.5 million for the first quarter of 2013;  On a sequential basis, bookings for the second quarter of 2013 increased 5% to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2013, marking the Company's first increase in bookings since the first quarter of 2012;  Total revenues decreased 40% to $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $5.2 million for the comparable period in 2012;  Quarterly bookings decreased 42% to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $5.3 million for the comparable period in 2012;  Net loss was $1.5 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted common share for the second quarter of 2013 as compared with a net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted common share, for the comparable period in 2012;  Available sources of liquidity  totaled $3.0 million at June 30, 2013.\"We are excited to report that quarterly bookings for the second quarter of 2013 were up 5% sequentially, when compared to the first quarter of 2013, and only down 42% when compared to the comparable period in 2012. Even more encouraging is that the sequential increase in bookings occurred despite a 16% reduction in advertising and marketing spend for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2013, demonstrating that AYI.com's new social features are resonating with its users and generating increased user engagement. We have seen an increase around the conversion of new users into paying subscribers since the launch of certain social features in March 2013,\" said Jon D. Pedersen, Sr., SNAP's Chief Financial Officer. \"Once again, our year-over-year results reflect a significant reduction in advertising and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2013 from the comparable period in 2012, which primarily results in decreased new user acquisition. We reduced our user acquisition from the second half of 2012 through January 2013 as we focused on rebuilding, testing and optimizing the redesigned AYI.com application. As we moved past the transitional phase of the re-launch, bookings began to improve during the first quarter of 2013, which continued during the second quarter of 2013.  Mr. Pedersen continued, \"In addition to the improved core business metrics noted above, there are other developments that we are excited about around managing our expenses moving forward. We recently announced that we completed a data center move that we expect to save the Company approximately $500,000 a year while improving operational flexibility and site performance. We have also continued to execute our hiring plans of assembling a top-notch product and engineering team, with nearly half of our employees being engineers now. With the majority of the team now in place to execute against our product roadmap, we expect our recruiting costs to decrease during the second half of 2013. Recruiting expenses totaled approximately $300,000 during the first half of 2013 and nearly $600,000 during 2012. We plan to redeploy that cost savings toward user acquisition and marketing to seek to grow our revenue during the second half of 2013 and beyond.\" Financial Highlights     Three Months Ended      Six Months Ended      June 30,      June 30,    GAAP Results      2013    2012    Change    2013    2012    Change  Total revenues    $   3,151,989    $   5,212,637       %    6,621,549    10,958,088       %  Advertising and marketing expense    $   952,248     3,023,656       %    2,083,929    7,543,897       %  Deferred revenue     $   2,031,702     3,654,943       %    2,031,702    3,654,943       %  Net loss    $       $       42   %               %  Net cash used in operating activities    $            972   %            56   %                  Non-GAAP Results                   Bookings    $   3,114,169    $   5,335,772       %    6,085,683    11,213,482       %  Overall liquidity     $   2,992,944     7,200,158       %    2,992,944    7,200,158       %   Management Commentary \"During 2012, we made a strategic decision to focus on investing in new hires and talent to support the long-term growth of the redesigned AYI.com, which is built around connecting via users' friends and interests. As we went through the transitional period, we purposely limited advertising and marketing expense,\" said SNAP's President and Chief Executive Officer Clifford Lerner. \"Overall advertising and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2013 remained substantially lower compared to the comparable period in 2012, resulting in declines in revenues, bookings and subscribers. Although a correlation exists between revenue and advertising and marketing expense, our revenue for the second quarter of 2013 declined only 40% while our advertising and marketing expense declined 69% versus the comparable period in 2012. We're excited to see our long-term vision begin to take hold since we've launched the new social-based features. This is most evidenced by the 5% sequential growth in bookings for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2013, despite a 16% reduction in advertising and marketing expense when comparing such periods.\" \"The AYI product's new feature-set, which leverages a user's social and interest graph to better connect people, has been a key driver of improving AYI.com's core metrics and user conversion rates. In additional to the increased conversion of new users to paying subscribers, we're also seeing increased messaging between users when users have friends and interests in common. Perhaps the most exciting data point since the re-launch, is that women in particular are embracing the social-based features. Women are more than twice as likely to contact a man when there is a friend in common, and 36% more likely to contact a man when she shares a common interest.\" \"We have also taken other steps to improve our internal analytics and user engagement and conversion,\" Lerner continued, \"We completed several new initiatives during the first quarter, including a deeper integration of Splunk to enable more real-time and granular analytics around user engagement and conversion rates. In addition, we made a number of organizational changes that enabled us to focus on improving specific user engagement metrics and prepared us for future growth, For example, we now have a team dedicated to optimizing existing features and testing new ideas. The impact of these changes was only partially realized during the second quarter of 2013, but we expect to experience the full positive impact during the remainder of 2013. Mr. Lerner concluded, \"As we move forward we will continue to focus on increasing conversion, tightly controlling fixed costs and growing the brand around the success of our social-based dating features. With the core feature set around friends and interests fully integrated into the experience, the data is showing that AYI.com is specifically filling a need for single women, as on-site engagement from women is higher when there are friends and interests in common with another user. As a result, we are as excited as ever about our future as we move into the second half of 2013.\" The Company has also released an updated investor presentation, which can be found at http://investors.snap-interactive.com/presentations About Snap Interactive, Inc.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results to assess operational performance and to determine our future capital requirements. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because it allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics we use in making operating decisions and because our investors and analysts use such information to help assess the health of our business. Some limitations of bookings and overall liquidity as financial measures include that: Bookings does not reflect that we defer and recognize revenue from subscription fees and micro-transactions over the length of the subscription term;  Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate bookings and overall liquidity differently or choose not to calculate bookings and overall liquidity at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures; and  Overall liquidity does not reflect the Company's ability to convert restricted cash into cash and cash equivalents. Because of these limitations, you should consider bookings and overall liquidity along with other financial performance measures, including total revenues, deferred revenue, net income , cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, net cash used in operating activities and our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  NEW YORK, Aug. 14, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Network-1 Security Solutions, Inc.  today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. Network-1 had revenue of $1,907,000 and $5,971,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared with revenue of $1,966,000 and $ 6,391,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively.  Network-1 reported net income of $782,000 or $0.03 per share  and $0.03  for the second quarter ended June 30, 2013 as compared $737,000 or $0.03 per share  and $0.02  for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012.

At June 30, 2013 the remaining deferred tax asset was $5,878,000. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, Network-1 acquired thirteen  patents as well as six  pending patent applications. Network-1 continues to review potential patent acquisitions and strategic relationships with third parties to monetize their patents. \"It was another strong quarter for Network-1,\" commented Corey M. Horowitz, Chairman and CEO of Network-1. \"Importantly, during this quarter we acquired a patent portfolio from Mirror Worlds, LLC which has significant licensing potential and at the same time continued to develop our content recognition patent portfolio acquired during the first quarter. Combined with our ongoing Remote Power Patent licensing initiatives, we are strongly positioned for continued growth in our overall technology licensing activities,\" he added. During the quarter, Network -1 initiated patent litigation against several vendors of document system software and computer systems in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,006,227 . Named as defendants in the lawsuit are Apple, Inc., Microsoft, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Lenovo Group Ltd., Lenovo, Inc., Dell, Inc., Best Buy Co., Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Samsung Telecommunications America L.L.C. Network-1 seeks, among others things, monetary damages based upon reasonable royalties.  The lawsuit alleges that that the Defendants have infringed and continue to infringe the claims of the '227 Patent by selling and offering to sell Mac OS and Windows operating systems as well as personal computers and tablets that include versions of those operating systems. The '227 Patent was among nine  patents and five  pending patent applications acquired by Network-1, through its newly formed subsidiary, Mirror Worlds Technologies, LLC, from Mirror Worlds, LLC  during the quarter. The '227 Patent entitled \"Document Stream Operating System\" relates to methods that enable unified search, indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system. The inventions described in the '227 Patent resulted from the work done by Yale University computer scientist, Professor David Gelernter, and his then graduate student, Dr. Eric Freeman, in the mid-1990s. Both Professor Gelernter and Dr. Freeman entered into consulting agreements with us as part of our acquisition of the MW Patent Portfolio.  Professor Gelernter and Dr. Freeman are currently associated with Lifestreams Technologies Corporation , a company that develops next generation applications and methodologies aimed at organizing and displaying digital data. Lifestreams is a licensee of the MW Patent Portfolio. In connection with the acquisition of the MW Patent Portfolio, we also acquired an equity interest in Lifestreams. In addition, in July 2013 we made an additional equity investment in Lifestreams and, as part of an amended license agreement with Lifestreams related to the MW Patent Portfolio, we received a warrant to purchase 7.5% of the outstanding common stock of Lifestreams on a fully diluted basis.

"title": "Fitch: Record Breaking Corporate Bond Volume Possible for 2013", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  NEW YORK---- Corporate bond volume thus far this year suggests record issuance for 2013, according to Fitch Ratings. New bonds totaling $547.4 billion were sold from Jan. 1 through July 31 - $220.8 billion of that amount was priced during the second quarter despite June's tapering-induced retreat.  The cost of borrowing continues to be a key driver of issuance. Despite talk of rising interest rates, company financing cost remains attractive. Growth in specific sectors also buoyed bond volume.  Computers and electronics, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and energy have been big players this year. Those three sectors accounted for 35% of industrial activity in the first half and have experienced significant growth since early 2010. Borrowing by entities in the computer and electronics sector has expanded 105% ; healthcare and pharmaceuticals is up 64%; and energy 60%. Notably, the speculative-grade component of outstanding energy bonds has grown at a faster rate  than the investment-grade portion .  The par weighted average coupon of fixed-rate U.S. corporate bonds dropped further to 5.5% at the end of June, from 5.6% at the end of March and 6.0% a year earlier. The 8% year-over-year decline now spans both financial and industrial bonds, with the two broad areas registering average coupons of 5.1% and 5.7%, respectively.  Sectors with a strong investment-grade profile have enjoyed even more significant year-over-year declines in their interest costs. These include food, beverage, and tobacco; computers and electronics; healthcare and pharmaceuticals; and industrial/manufacturing. Each saw their average coupon shrink more than 10% over the past year.  The volume of financial bond issuance is virtually unchanged from the beginning of the recovery, but Fitch thinks the pace is likely to change. Issuance picked up in July with $34.6 billion sold. Stronger demand for commercial and industrial loans, improved demand for consumer loans and a greater willingness among banks to lend could also propel issuance.  Of course, the economy's trajectory in the second half and reaction to the Federal Reserve's policy directives will play a role in just how much companies are willing to borrow from investors, but given the trends noted above, we believe corporate bond volume could break a record this year.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  FORT MILL, S.C., Aug. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent study on shopping behaviors confirmed what most know instinctively: it's no fun to wait in line at check out, and three out of four shoppers say this is what they hate most about shopping . Honeywell  today announced two new tools for retailers to shorten check out times and make shopping more personalized for customers and store owners. Honeywell's Captuvo SL42 and SL22 are encasements for the Apple iPhone 5 and fifth generation iPod Touch mobile digital devices, respectively, turning the consumer devices into selling tools that allow retail workers to look up inventory, scan barcodes and securely process payment, bringing the check out to the shopper so no one has to wait in line.   Both new products feature Honeywell Adaptus 6.0 imaging technology, which accurately reads virtually any bar code, including coupons or loyalty club bar codes increasingly found on the reflective screens of mobile devices. \"Mobile POS enablers like our Captuvo line are quickly changing the way customers and stores do business, and you will continue to see innovation from Honeywell in this area,\" said Peter Fehl, vice president of global marketing for Honeywell Scanning &amp; Mobility. \"What sets apart Honeywell devices is our technology with the industry's best scanning capability, security features and durability.\"  Scanning performance, durability and ease-of-use were key factors that led executives from Sportsman's Warehouse  to equip workers in each of its 46 stores with the Captuvo SL22 for iPod Touch mobile digital devices. The company's big-box stores across the United States are a one-stop shop for outdoors enthusiasts, selling sporting goods, clothing, footwear and supplies to campers, fishers and hunters.  \"The Honeywell Captuvo SL22 is a great fit for our low-key shopping environment: it extends our workers' product and inventory expertise, and is much easier for customers and our workers to use than a traditional aisle-based check-out lane,\" said Mike Van Orden, chief technology officer for Sportsman's Warehouse. \"And because it's based on the Apple iOS, our employees already are familiar with the user interface, so there is very little training needed, even for temporary or seasonal help.\"  The Captuvo SL22 is now shipping, and the SL42 will ship this month. The first generation Captuvo SL22 sled for iPod Touch 4 was released in July 2012.  For more information, please visit www.honeywellaidc.com.

The company reported strong financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 . Why Kept at Neutral? We believe that Qualcomm will continue to perform well due to a significant surge in the demand for smartphones and tablets. Management has raised its outlook for fiscal 2013 and is quite confident that it will be able to retain its current rate of revenue and earnings growth, going forward. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of the company remain intriguing given the increasing demand for LTE-enabled mobile handsets in the developed countries, rapid transition from 2G to 3G and 4G in China and India and increasing licensing revenues. Qualcomm has a very healthy cash position, helping it to undertake several R&amp;D activities for the next-generation products. Qualcomm is a major chipset supplier to Samsung, which is currently the largest seller of smartphones globally and a major chipset supplier to Apple Inc.  for its popular iPhones. Google Inc.  has decided to use Snapdragon processor for its latest Nexus 7 tablets. Qualcomm has been favored by the Windows 8 operating system of Microsoft Corp. . During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, Qualcomm shipped 172 million MSM chipsets, up 22% year over year. This figure was far better than the company's guidance of a mid-point of 168 million. Average selling price of mobile handsets with an in-build Qualcomm chipset during this quarter was around $227-$233. This sequential increase registered a substantial hike of $13 from the last quarter's mid-point. Nevertheless, the ongoing global economic volatility may severely impact the telecommunications industry, which in turn may negatively affect the demand for Qualcomm developed chipsets. Qualcomm's future growth depends on the continuous deployment of CDMA/OFDMA-based network technologies. If the emerging markets fail to maintain the current rate of installing high-speed 3G, next-generation 4G or any hybrid 3G-4G wireless networks, the demand for smartphones will decline, which will affect Qualcomm's financials. Elizabeth Arden Downgraded to Strong Sell Zacks Investment Research downgraded Elizabeth Arden, Inc.  to a Zacks Rank #5  on Aug 13, following dismal fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 results announced last week. Why the Downgrade? Elizabeth Arden has witnessed sharp downward estimate revisions after reporting lower-than-expected fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results. Shares of this makeup and skin care company crashed after the announcement and given its weak outlook for the upcoming fiscal year it has more downside left. On Aug 8, Elizabeth Arden reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 10 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 68.8% and the year-ago earnings by 64.3% due to lower revenues and poor margins. Revenues rose only 0.8% to $267.9 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $289 million. The fiscal 2013 earnings and revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates and fell short of the company's expectations. The company's growth expectations for the Elizabeth Arden brand one of the most widely recognized beauty brands in the world proved to be too optimistic leading the company to perform below expectations in the year. Additionally, lower-than-expected orders from one of the largest North American mass retail customers and a weak performance in Europe, especially in the U.K., pulled down revenues in both fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. In addition, Elizabeth Arden issued a relatively weak outlook for fiscal 2014. For full year 2014, sales are expected to grow between 3.0% and 5.0% year over year, much lower than the growth seen in fiscal 2013. Earnings are expected in the range of $2.15 to $2.30, representing approximately 4% growth at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 decreased a sharp 22.1% to $2.19 per share over the last 7 days as all the estimates were revised downwards. Estimates for fiscal 2015 went down 23.6% over the same timeframe. Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  FORT COLLINS, Colo.---- OtterBox, maker of premium protective cases for mobile technology, has won another battle in the ongoing war against counterfeiters. A U.S. District Court judge recently issued a permanent injunction against a New York-based company and ordered it to pay OtterBox $2 million related to the sale of counterfeit cases.  The court found that S &amp; P Trading Inc. violated provisions of the Lanham Act when it purchased and then sold no less than 146,025 counterfeit cases, infringing on federally registered trademarks for which OtterBox owns all rights. This is the latest judgment in a series of actions OtterBox has taken to protect its brand.  Counterfeit consumer product goods continue to be a drain on the global economy. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection  seized counterfeit goods totaling $1.26 billion in retail value.* Like so many other premium consumer brands, OtterBox aggressively fights against intellectual property theft.  OtterBox was built on bringing our customers innovative, first-to-market products, said OtterBox CEO Brian Thomas. A lot of design, engineering and testing goes into each of our custom protective cases, which is why we take a hard line with companies creating and selling fake cases, as well as those infringing on our patents and trademarks. Counterfeit products damage our reputation for delivering premium quality products because many consumers arent aware that they purchased a fake OtterBox. If a deal seems to be too good to be true, it probably is.  OtterBox currently has more than 110 trademark registrations worldwide with several pending. Additionally, the company holds more than 190 patents in the U.S., placing it among the top innovators in the wireless communications space just between Apple Inc. and BlackBerry. In 2012, OtterBox, in collaboration with CBP, confiscated more than 118,000 counterfeit items and was awarded judgments and settlements totaling nearly $11 million.  About OtterBox:  Starting with something as simple as a box, OtterBox was founded in 1998 with a line of indestructible dryboxes. Today, OtterBox is the No. 1-selling case for smartphones** and offers an extensive lineup of premium screen protectors and other device-enhancing accessories that complement various consumer lifestyles.  OtterBoxs strong relationships with the leading mobile device manufacturers, retailers and wireless services providers delivers unrivaled value, world-class customer service and a continued commitment to premium product quality.  OtterBox has been a five-time honoree on the Inc. 5000 ranking of fastest growing private companies in the U.S., recognized by Forbes Magazine on Americas Most Promising Companies and is a repeat honoree in the Great Place to Work annual survey published by FORTUNE Magazine. The family-owned, private company has global headquarters in Fort Collins, Colo. and offices in Boston, San Diego, Cork, Ireland and Hong Kong.  For more information, visit otterbox.com.

"title": "OBJE App Revenues Rise as Google Play Overtakes Apple", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "  SARASOTA, Fla.---- Phantasmic, the first gaming app developed by OBJ Enterprises  and Novalon Games, appears to have hit the Google  Play app market at just the right time to capitalize on a boom in usage of Android devices.  Last week, USA Today reported that Google Play app downloads were 10 percent higher than traditional industry leader Apples  App Store in the second quarter of 2013. While this reversal serves as another sign of Google Plays ascendant dominance, the numbers for gaming apps are even more stark: Games make up more than 80 percent of the revenue on Google Play, compared to 75 percent on the App Store.  Games are the fuel that has powered Google Plays revenue lead in this crucial vertical, said OBJE CEO Paul Watson. While we look forward to working with the App Store soon, too, there is no place better to offer a hot new gaming app like Phantasmic than Google Play. Thats why it was the first app market in which it was made available.  Phantasmic is only the beginning of OBJEs gaming app ambitions. The company expects to release two new, must-have gamesCreature Tavern and Bluff Wars 2.0on both the App Store and Google Play before the end of the summer.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": "   Kamarul Akhir | AFP | Getty Images  US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel speaks at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur on August 25, 2013   The Pentagon is prepared to carry out military options on Syria should President Barack Obama order them, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Sunday.  Hagel echoed White House statements cautioning that America was still gathering the facts about the Syrian government's alleged use of poison gas against civilians.    But he noted that the U.S. military, which is repositioning its naval forces in the Mediterranean to give Obama the option for an armed strike, was ready to act if asked.        Did Syria cross red line?  NBC's Steve Handelsman reports critics in Washington are complaining that President Obama's delay of any U.S. military response is giving Syria a green light to use weapons again. Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, Huffington Post; Avik Roy, Manhattan Institute; and Mark Simone, WOR radio talk show host, share their opinions on what they want President Obama to do.    \"President Obama has asked the Defense Department to prepare options for all contingencies. We have done that and we are prepared to exercise whatever option - if he decides to employ one of those options,\" Hagel told reporters at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur.  American and European security sources have said U.S. and allied intelligence agencies made a preliminary assessment that chemical weapons were used by Syrian forces in the attack. The United Nations has requested access to the site.  Hagel, whose week-long trip to Asia is being overshadowed by Syria tensions, participated remotely in a meeting on Saturday that Obama held with his top military and national security advisers to hash out options on Syria.  Asked whether, after that meeting, he was personally convinced chemical weapons had been used in Syria, Hagel said: \"We, along with our allies, are continuing to assess the intelligence, and the specifics of that intelligence, on the use chemical weapons.\"  \"I wouldn't go any further than that until we have more intelligence, based on facts,\" he said.  Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria's civil war, but reports of the killings near Damascus have put pressure on the White House to make good on the president's comment a year ago that chemical weapons would be a \"red line\" for the United States.  Hagel did not enter into detail about what options the United States was weighing, but noted that any scenario carried risks. He noted on his flight to Malaysia that if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces intentionally used chemical weapons, \"there may be another attack coming\".  \"There are risks and consequences for any option that would be used -- or not used. For action or inaction,\" Hagel said on Sunday.  \"All of those assessments are being made. They will be driven by \u007f the facts, what our intelligence assessment produces, law, legal issues, international support.\"  "

Emerging markets are still a source of global growth, Walter Bucky Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of assets at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said by phone. Stocks in developing-nations were so oversold that some money came in to take advantage of the bounce, he said. The gauge of developing nations is trading at 9.8 times estimated earnings, below the valuation of developed markets of 13.6. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index, a measure of options prices on the fund and expectations of price swings, slid 7 percent to 24.20.

Brazils Ibovespa  rose for the first time in three days as Vale SA paced gains among Brazils commodity exporters amid speculation about stronger demand from China, the countrys top trading partner. Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, rallied as newspapers reported that the government will allow the state-controlled oil producer to increase fuel prices.

The vendor matrix ranked companies on several criteria related to both product Implementation and vendor Innovation. The overall winner in this tablet Competitive Assessment was Samsung Electronics. The Korean-based computing and consumer electronics conglomerate bested all other tablet vendors in the Innovation category while scoring second overall in the Implementation category. Clearly king of the hill when it comes to tablet shipment volumes, Apple trailed Samsung on tablet Innovation landing in second. The two leading makers have continued to distance themselves from other tablet vendors, reflected visually in the results grouping of vendors for this assessment. In third place, overall, for the vendor matrix is Xplore Technologies. A specialist in rugged tablets for vertical business audiences, Xplore recently launched the first rugged Android tablet. The company came out ahead of the majority of vendors assessed in this vendor matrix with a good balance between Implementation and Innovation. Samsung bested all other tablet vendors in the Innovation category with great scores for its breadth of tablet portfolio, leadership in owning much of the component technology used in its products, and support for incremental user interfaces beyond the touch display. Following Samsung on Innovation was Apple and Xplore Technologies. Apple topped the pack of tablet vendors with its Implementation scores for the success it has had over the past year with its iPad. Beyond its production prowess, Apple has done an amazing job educating the marketplace through TV, print, and digital marketing about tablets and how these devices appeal to user audiences. The company also received perfect scores for its geographic market reach in all regions of the world. Runners up in Implementation are Samsung and Lenovo. Chinas Lenovo was squarely focused this past year on its home market and made impressive gains in mind and market share. Apples success with iPad tablet shipments is undeniable, says senior practice director Jeff Orr. Looking ahead, the breadth of Samsungs product portfolio and technology ownership give it a leadership role for future tablet development.

"author": "Aaron Ricadela", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "//'); //]]> You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play // HP Shakes-Up Management as Profit Slumps on Sales The roadblocks to Hewlett-Packard Co. s turnaround are mounting. Meg Whitman, hired as chief executive officer almost two years ago to revive the storied Silicon Valley computer maker, had said revenue would rise next year as personal-computer sales stabilized. She scrapped that prediction yesterday. PC shipments are slumping for longer than Whitman had foreseen, theres weak demand for enterprise hardware and services, and Dell Inc.  and other competitors are siphoning away sales with aggressive pricing. Cost-cutting is also reaching its limit amid a move to eliminate 29,000 jobs. Whitman is still facing hurdles after three years of write-offs, management upheaval, strategy shifts and slowing growth. The signs are clear that 80 percent of their business will have headwinds in fiscal 2014 -- thats PCs, printers, and services, said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc., who has an underperform rating on the shares, the equivalent of a sell. Management had some bullish expectations about the environment and theyre not materializing now. Whitman took the helm in 2011, asking investors to be patient and scaling back her predecessors growth projections that she said were too cheery. The stock had risen 78 percent this year on signs that a turnaround may be taking hold. Results for the fiscal third quarter showed revenue declines across most of Hewlett-Packards businesses, and the companys forecasts for the period through October fell short of some analysts estimates. Spending Environment Earnings excluding some items will be 98 cents to $1.02 a share for the fiscal fourth quarter through October, the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a statement yesterday. Analysts were predicting $1.01 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the 2013 fiscal year, earnings will be $3.53 to $3.57 a share, compared with the companys previous forecast of $3.50 to $3.60. Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 10 percent to $22.83 at 9:49 a.m. in New York, for the biggest decline since November. In yesterdays conference call with analysts, Whitman cited a weak enterprise spending environment, with sales challenged in Europe and China. Pointing to difficulties in Hewlett-Packards enterprise and PC businesses, she now projects that year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2014 is unlikely. Whitman had previously said she expects sales growth in the next fiscal year. PC Slump PC shipments fell in the second quarter for a fifth straight period, sliding 11 percent, market researcher Gartner said in July. Consumers are increasingly opting for tablets instead of traditional desktops and notebooks, and businesses are holding onto old machines for longer. For the fiscal third quarter which ended in July, sales fell 8 percent to $27.2 billion, compared with analysts average estimate for $27.3 billion. Earnings excluding some items were 86 cents a share, compared with the average projection of 87 cents. Net income was $1.39 billion, compared with analysts $1.19 billion estimate. Sales in the group that includes PCs fell 11 percent to $7.7 billion. Hewlett-Packard is missing out on three of the biggest trends in technology: The rise of smartphones and tablets, businesses move to online computing services from on-site hardware and software, according to Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co., who rates the shares a sell. If HP could just convince the Street that theyre going to participate in any one of these trends, it would lead to a resurgence in revenue and profit growth, Kreher said. Management Shuffle The enterprise division, which includes computer servers, data-storage devices and networking equipment, reported revenue shrank 9.4 percent to $6.79 billion in the fiscal third-quarter, while earnings before taxes fell 19.5 percent to $1.03 billion. Declines in the high-end servers and lucrative technology support services sapped profits, the company said. Whitman is shaking up her team again, seeking to rescue the turnaround effort by promoting Chief Operating Officer Bill Veghte as head of the enterprise group, replacing Dave Donatelli. Henry Gomez, chief of communications, is replacing Marty Homlish as chief marketing officer. Donatelli is leaving his job after prolonged tensions with Whitman, said people with knowledge of the matter. The appointments are the latest executive moves being made by Whitman. In June, she moved Todd Bradley, the head of the personal-computer and printer division to another job. Donatelli and Homlish are being given new roles. Fresh Ideas Whitman said in a statement she was shuffling management as the industry is undergoing profound change and you need to rapidly respond with fresh ideas and bold execution. Veghte, a former Microsoft Corp.  executive, is also taking on responsibility of Hewlett-Packards cloud-computing services, an area where its struggled to gain market share. Whitman has also shaken up Hewlett-Packards board. The company added three directors in July, including former Microsoft software head Ray Ozzie, Jim Skinner, the former CEO of McDonalds Corp. and current chairman of Walgreen Co., and Dob Bennett, the ex-CEO of Liberty Media Corp. The changes come after former chairman Ray Lane resigned his position in April, and Hewlett-Packard is searching for a new chairman. I view this as a marking-time quarter in the process of them re-allocating their assets and shoring up the various divisions, said Chris Bertelsen chief investment officer at Global Financial Private Capital, in Sarasota, Florida, which bought Hewlett-Packard stock last year and pared its position this year after a run-up in price. Its a restructuring and execution story.

"content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Qualcomm, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Elizabeth Arden PR Newswire CHICAGO, Aug. 15, 2013 CHICAGO, Aug. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Qualcomm Inc., Apple Inc., Google Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Elizabeth Arden, Inc..  Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free. Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog: Qualcomm Remains Neutral We reiterate our long-term Neutral recommendation onQualcomm Inc.. The company reported strong financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 . Why Kept at Neutral? We believe that Qualcomm will continue to perform well due to a significant surge in the demand for smartphones and tablets. Management has raised its outlook for fiscal 2013 and is quite confident that it will be able to retain its current rate of revenue and earnings growth, going forward. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of the company remain intriguing given the increasing demand for LTE-enabled mobile handsets in the developed countries, rapid transition from 2G to 3G and 4G in China and India and increasing licensing revenues. Qualcomm has a very healthy cash position, helping it to undertake several R&D activities for the next-generation products. Qualcomm is a major chipset supplier to Samsung, which is currently the largest seller of smartphones globally and a major chipset supplier toApple Inc. for its popular iPhones.Google Inc. has decided to use Snapdragon processor for its latest Nexus 7 tablets. Qualcomm has been favored by the Windows 8 operating system ofMicrosoft Corp.. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, Qualcomm shipped 172 million MSM chipsets, up 22% year over year. This figure was far better than the company's guidance of a mid-point of 168 million. Average selling price of mobile handsets with an in-build Qualcomm chipset during this quarter was around $227-$233. This sequential increase registered a substantial hike of $13 from the last quarter's mid-point. Nevertheless, the ongoing global economic volatility may severely impact the telecommunications industry, which in turn may negatively affect the demand for Qualcomm developed chipsets. Qualcomm's future growth depends on the continuous deployment of CDMA/OFDMA-based network technologies. If the emerging markets fail to maintain the current rate of installing high-speed 3G, next-generation 4G or any hybrid 3G-4G wireless networks, the demand for smartphones will decline, which will affect Qualcomm's financials. Elizabeth Arden Downgraded to Strong Sell Zacks Investment Research downgradedElizabeth Arden, Inc. to a Zacks Rank #5  on Aug 13, following dismal fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 results announced last week. Why the Downgrade? Elizabeth Arden has witnessed sharp downward estimate revisions after reporting lower-than-expected fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results. Shares of this makeup and skin care company crashed after the announcement and given its weak outlook for the upcoming fiscal year it has more downside left. On Aug 8, Elizabeth Arden reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 10 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 68.8% and the year-ago earnings by 64.3% due to lower revenues and poor margins. Revenues rose only 0.8% to $267.9 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $289 million. The fiscal 2013 earnings and revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates and fell short of the company's expectations. The company's growth expectations for the Elizabeth Arden brand one of the most widely recognized beauty brands in the world proved to be too optimistic leading the company to perform below expectations in the year. Additionally, lower-than-expected orders from one of the largest North American mass retail customers and a weak performance in Europe, especially in the U.K., pulled down revenues in both fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. In addition, Elizabeth Arden issued a relatively weak outlook for fiscal 2014. For full year 2014, sales are expected to grow between 3.0% and 5.0% year over year, much lower than the growth seen in fiscal 2013. Earnings are expected in the range of $2.15 to $2.30, representing approximately 4% growth at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 decreased a sharp 22.1% to $2.19 per share over the last 7 days as all the estimates were revised downwards. Estimates for fiscal 2015 went down 23.6% over the same timeframe. Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.

"content": "Honeywell Helps Retailers Get Mobile With New Scanning And Payment Accessories For iPod Touch And iPhone 5 Mobile Devices Sportsman's Warehouse to Begin Rollout of 500 Devices in Stores Across the United States in Time for Holiday Shopping Season PR Newswire FORT MILL, S.C., Aug. 15, 2013 FORT MILL, S.C., Aug. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --A recent study on shopping behaviors confirmed what most know instinctively: it's no fun to wait in line at check out, and three out of four shoppers say this is what they hate most about shopping . Honeywell  today announced two new tools for retailers to shorten check out times and make shopping more personalized for customers and store owners. Honeywell's Captuvo SL42 and SL22 are encasements for the Apple iPhone 5 and fifth generation iPod Touch mobile digital devices, respectively, turning the consumer devices into selling tools that allow retail workers to look up inventory, scan barcodes and securely process payment, bringing the check out to the shopper so no one has to wait in line.  Both new products feature Honeywell Adaptus 6.0 imaging technology, which accurately reads virtually any bar code, including coupons or loyalty club bar codes increasingly found on the reflective screens of mobile devices. \"Mobile POS enablers like our Captuvo line are quickly changing the way customers and stores do business, and you will continue to see innovation from Honeywell in this area,\" said Peter Fehl, vice president of global marketing for Honeywell Scanning & Mobility. \"What sets apart Honeywell devices is our technology with the industry's best scanning capability, security features and durability.\" Scanning performance, durability and ease-of-use were key factors that led executives from Sportsman's Warehouse  to equip workers in each of its 46 stores with the Captuvo SL22 for iPod Touch mobile digital devices. The company's big-box stores across the United States are a one-stop shop for outdoors enthusiasts, selling sporting goods, clothing, footwear and supplies to campers, fishers and hunters. \"The Honeywell Captuvo SL22 is a great fit for our low-key shopping environment: it extends our workers' product and inventory expertise, and is much easier for customers and our workers to use than a traditional aisle-based check-out lane,\" said Mike Van Orden, chief technology officer for Sportsman's Warehouse. \"And because it's based on the Apple^ iOS, our employees already are familiar with the user interface, so there is very little training needed, even for temporary or seasonal help.\" The Captuvo SL22 is now shipping, and the SL42 will ship this month. The first generation Captuvo SL22 sled for iPod Touch 4 was released in July 2012. For more information, please visit www.honeywellaidc.com.

"author": "Alex Barinka", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "Stocks and metals gained on data showing improvement in manufacturing and the U.S. labor market as a computer error halted trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The dollar rose as signs of an improving global economy increased speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus. The Standard & Poors 500 Index  added 0.8 percent at 3:17 p.m. in New York. The Nasdaq rose 0.9 percent to 3,631.17 today before trading halted around 12:20 p.m. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1 percent. Copper jumped 0.7 percent to pace gains in commodities. The yield on 10-year Treasuries reached a two-year high. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index added 0.2 percent after a 0.6 percent advance yesterday. Germany led growth in manufacturing and services in the euro area, while a gauge for Chinas factory output unexpectedly showed expansion. The fewest workers in more than five years applied for U.S. jobless benefits over the past month, indicating the labor market continues to improve, and an index of leading indicators rose in July by the most in three months. Were seeing better economic data out of Europe and China, with several positive surprises, Thomas Haerter, who helps oversee about $54 billion as chief strategist at Swisscanto Asset Management AG in Zurich, said in a telephone interview today. Getting better-than-forecast numbers out of Europe is even more positive for stocks than better-than-forecast data out of the U.S., as the growth problem is mainly in Europe. Trading Halt Computer errors shook American equity markets again this week as malfunctioning software that feeds data between exchanges prompted Nasdaq to halt trading in stocks and options. Buying and selling in many of the countrys most heavily traded shares from Apple Inc. to Intel Corp. and Facebook Inc. ground to a virtual halt as brokers were unable to execute orders. Nasdaq said trading for all its listed stocks will resume by about 3:25 p.m. The disruption, coming two days after options markets were roiled by mistaken trades sent by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is the latest in a series of computer malfunctions that have raised questions about the reliability of electronic markets. Fed Minutes The S&P 500 fell 0.6 percent yesterday to the lowest level since July 8 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined for a sixth day, the longest losing streak in 13 months, after the release of minutes from the Feds latest meeting. The report showed policy makers were comfortable with Chairman Ben S. Bernankes plans to start reducing bond buying this year should the U.S. economy improve. Fed stimulus helped push the S&P 500 up as much as 153 percent from its March 2009 low. The number of jobless claims in the month ended Aug. 17 declined to 330,500 a week on average, the least since November 2007, Labor Department figures showed today. Compared with a week earlier, claims rose by 13,000 to 336,000, in line with the median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Conference Boards gauge of the outlook for the next three to six months increased 0.6 percent after no change the prior month, the New York-based group said today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.5 percent advance. Homebuilders Rise A gauge of homebuilders added 2 percent after a report showed U.S. house prices rose in June. Newmont Mining Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. advanced more than 1.3 percent as copper rose. Yahoo Inc. climbed 2.7 percent after data showed it attracted more U.S. visitors than Google Inc. in July. Hewlett-Packard Co.  dropped 12 percent as the worlds second-biggest maker of personal computers issued a forecast for fiscal fourth-quarter profit that missed some estimates. More than five shares advanced for every one that declined in the Stoxx 600, which rebounded 1 percent from a three-week low. Royal Ahold NV rallied 5.2 percent after the Dutch owner of the Stop & Shop supermarket chain reported second-quarter earnings that beat analysts estimates. Euro-area services expanded in August for the first time in 19 months, led by Germany, and manufacturing gained for a second month, London-based Markit Economics said today. We are probably either at or just past the mid-point of the economic cycle, Ashish Misra, who helps oversee $17 billion as head of investment policy and research for Lloyds TSB Private Banking in London, said in a phone interview. The negative influence of rising interest rates will be, or is being, offset by the positive influence of the reasons behind the rise in interest rates. Emerging Markets The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 0.2 percent, extending its six-day slump to 4.7 percent. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index tumbled 6 percent as trading resumed after a three-day closure. The Jakarta Composite Index dropped 1.1 percent, declining 20 percent from a record-high three months ago. Benchmark gauges in Turkey, Malaysia and South Korea declined at least 1 percent. Indias Sensex rose 2.3 percent after a four-day 7.6 percent slump sent the gauge to an 11-month low. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in Hong Kong advanced 1.1 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent. A purchasing managers index of preliminary China manufacturing data unexpectedly rose to 50.1 for August, from 47.7 in July, according to HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. That compares with a 48.2 median estimate by 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion. Rupee, Lira Indias rupee and the Turkish lira slumped to all-time lows. The rupee dropped 0.9 percent to 64.63 against the dollar, after reaching 65.56, and the lira slipped as much as 0.9 percent to $1.9959. Thailands baht and the Malaysian ringgit dropped to three-year lows. South Africas rand gained 0.8 percent and Australias dollar jumped 0.4 percent after the Chinese manufacturing report boosted trade prospects. Norways krone weakened for an eighth consecutive day against its Swedish counterpart, sliding as much as 1.2 percent to 1.0676 kronor, the weakest level since March 2004. Swedens currency gained against 14 of its 16 main counterparts after a report showed unemployment unexpectedly fell last month. The euro was little changed at $1.3350 while the yen weakened 0.9 percent to 98.59 per dollar. Treasury 10-year note yields rose one basis points to 2.90 percent after climbing eight basis points yesterday. The rate reached 2.93 percent, the most since July 2011. German bonds fell for a second day, sending 10-year yields up five basis points to 1.92 percent. Copper rose 0.7 percent to $3.3345 a pound on the Comex in New York. China is the biggest buyer of the metal, followed by the U.S. and Germany. West Texas Intermediate oil advanced from a two-week low, gaining 1.1 percent to $105.02 a barrel.

Lenovo computers bundled with Pokki will begin to hit stores in the next several weeks, starting with English-speaking countries, and eventually to all of the computers that the Chinese computer giant sells globally, said Chester Ng, the co-founder and chief marketing officer at SweetLabs.SweetLabs has been distributing the software on its own through its website, and more than 3 million Windows 8 users have downloaded it. The average user opens it 10 times a day, Ng said. The software also includes an app store, which competes with Microsoft's Windows Store.When details started leaking out before the release of Windows 8 that Microsoft might scrap the iconic Start button and menu, SweetLabs scrabbled to develop an alternative. The startup, which is backed by Intel Capital and Google Ventures, was ready to release Pokki when Windows 8 went on sale in October.After a speech Ng gave at an Intel Capital conference, he was approached by representatives from Lenovo about working together. SweetLabs is now in talks with other computer makers on similar deals, he said.In addition to easing customers' transition to Windows 8, Lenovo may have another incentive for using Pokki: cold, hard cash. Zynga and other app vendors pay for prominent placement in the app store, and the startup will share the wealth with Lenovo, Ng said. \"We make the user experience better and help them make more money,\" he said."

"title": "HP Profit Forecast Misses Some Estimates on PC Slump - Bloomberg", 
"author": "Aaron Ricadela", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "Hewlett-Packard Co.  issued a forecast for fiscal fourth-quarter profit that missed some analysts estimates, and Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman rescinded a projection for growth in fiscal 2014 as ebbing demand for personal computers and lower business spending hamper her turnaround efforts. The second-biggest PC maker and largest printer supplier also unveiled a shake-up of its top ranks, naming Chief Operating Officer Bill Veghte as head of its enterprise business, replacing Dave Donatelli. Chief of Communications Henry Gomez was promoted to chief marketing officer, replacing Marty Homlish. Earnings excluding some items will be 98 cents to $1.02 a share for the period which ends in October, the company said in a statement today. Analysts predicted $1.01 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the 2013 fiscal year, earnings will be $3.53 to $3.57 a share, compared with the companys previous forecast of $3.50 to $3.60. The stock fell in extended trading. Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California, is suffering from an extended decline in PC demand and shifts to mobile technologies that have sapped its sales, even as its eliminating 29,000 jobs, delivering new products and paying down debt to improve its competitive position. A fifth consecutive quarter of declining global PC shipments crimped profit at the company, which hasnt expanded quickly enough in new devices like smartphones and tablets. In Retreat In a conference call with analysts, CEO Whitman cited a weak enterprise spending environment, with sales challenged in Europe and China. Pointing to difficulties in Hewlett-Packards enterprise and PC businesses, she said she now projects that total company year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2014 is unlikely. Whitman had previously said she expects sales growth in the next fiscal year, which begins in November. Shares fell as much as 6.4 percent to $23.75 in late trading after closing down 1.8 percent at $25.38 in New York. The stock has climbed 78 percent this year compared with a 15 percent gain in the Standard & Poors 500 Index. For the fiscal third quarter through July, sales fell 8 percent to $27.2 billion, compared with analysts average for $27.3 billion. Earnings excluding some items were 86 cents a share, compared with the average projection of 87 cents. Net income was $1.39 billion, compared with analysts $1.19 billion estimate. Marking Time I view this as a marking-time quarter in the process of them re-allocating their assets and shoring up the various divisions, said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer at Global Financial Private Capital, in Sarasota, Florida, which bought Hewlett-Packard stock last year and pared its position this year after a run-up in price. Under Whitmans executive changes today, Donatelli and Homlish are being given new roles. Donatelli will focus on identifying early-stage technologies, the company said in a statement, while Homlish will take on a new position as chief customer experience officer. In a statement, Whitman said she was making the new appointments as the industry is undergoing profound change and you need to rapidly respond with fresh ideas and bold execution. Tense Times Donatelli is leaving his position after prolonged tensions with Whitman, said people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isnt public. In June, Whitman reorganized the PC and printer group, replacing longtime head Todd Bradley with one of his deputies, former Lenovo Group Ltd. executive Dion Weisler. Whitman has also shaken up Hewlett-Packards board. The company added three directors in July, including former Microsoft Corp. software head Ray Ozzie, Jim Skinner, the former CEO of McDonalds Corp. and current chairman of Walgreen Co., and Dob Bennett, the ex-CEO of Liberty Media Corp. The changes come after former chairman Ray Lane resigned his position in April, and Hewlett-Packard is searching for a new chairman. Todays management changes come as sales and profit in Hewlett-Packards enterprise computing group are sliding. Revenue declined 9.4 percent to $6.79 billion, and earnings before taxes dropped 20 percent to $1.03 billion. Sales in the group that includes PCs fell 11 percent to $7.7 billion. Veghte is also responsible for Hewlett-Packards cloud-computing services, an area where its struggled to gain market share, said Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co., who has a sell rating on the shares. Missing Out Hewlett-Packard is missing out on three of the biggest trends in technology: The rise of smartphones and tablets, businesses move to online computing services from on-site hardware and software, and the replacement of its stock-in-trade photo printing with Web services from Facebook Inc. , Google Inc. and others, Kreher said. If HP could just convince the Street that theyre going to participate in any one of these trends, it would lead to a resurgence in revenue and profit growth, said Kreher. At the same time, PC shipments fell in the second quarter for a fifth straight period, sliding 10.9 percent, market researcher Gartner said in July. Consumers are increasingly opting for tablets instead of traditional desktops and notebooks, and businesses are holding onto old machines for longer. Dell Inc., the third-largest PC maker, is preparing to go private in a $24.9 billion leveraged buyout by CEO Michael Dell and his partner Silver Lake Management LLC. The deal would give the company the flexibility to invest in becoming more competitive in PCs, servers and other areas. Industry Landscape Hewlett-Packard, the No. 2 PC maker after Lenovo, has added tablets running Windows and Google Inc. s Android operating system. Its also delivering new printers, including the Officejet Pro X that delivers laser-printer speed and quality using cheaper liquid-ink technology. In its enterprise-computing group, which includes servers, storage and networking equipment, the new Moonshot server and 3Par data-storage systems are improving Hewlett-Packards competitive position and boosting margins, Maynard Um, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said in an Aug. 13 note to clients. The company is facing competition in its data-center group from Cisco Systems Inc., EMC Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. Hewlett-Packard plans to hold a meeting with financial analysts in San Jose, California, on Oct. 9, at which its expected issue guidance for next year, Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, said in an Aug. 14 research note.

"content": "Former Apple CIO Launches Los Angeles Investment Management Firm Steve Johnson, CFA brings to Adherence Capital Management the same conservative investment philosophies used while Apple's investment subsidiary, Braeburn Capital, Inc., grew over $100 billion in just five years. LOS ANGELES, Calif., Aug. 20, 2013  -- via PRWEB - Adherence Capital Management is an emerging Los Angeles boutique investment management firm built on the co-founders' record of using disciplined investment strategies to preserve capital and build wealth. Steve, most recently the chief investment officer  of Apple's Inc.'s wholly owned investment subsidiary, Braeburn Capital, Inc., has partnered with Mark Lewis, former managing director and principal at Wilshire Associates. Together, they combine over 40 years' experience, both buy-side and sell-side, leading businesses, institutions, governments and high net worth investors to prudently grow portfolios. Johnson and Lewis both believe in careful data-driven decision making in adherence to a disciplined approach to investing. Careful calculation of a client's risk tolerance, and then measuring and understanding portfolio risks are the basis for the client-adherent portfolios Adherence Capital crafts. \"At Apple, everyone needed to bring data, not just opinions,\" Steve Johnson said. \"Nobody wanted that 3 AM phone call from Steve Jobs. It seems to me that any number of individuals and organizations would benefit if they adhered to this kind of discipline.\" Johnson brings a distinguished background to Adherence Capital Management. Between 2007 and 2012, Johnson led Braeburn Capital's consistent growth during turbulent times in global financial markets. From a one-person operation in charge of $13 billion, Johnson managed the growth of Apple's investment management firm into a $113 billion enterprise with a staff of five. Braeburn Capital managed Apple's cash, short-term and long-term investments. \"In my opinion, Steve Job's greatest design was how he designed Apple itself,\" Johnson said. \"The company was taking plenty of risk on the product side so we kept the investment portfolio pristine. The number one rule was 'never invest in something you don't understand.' Each risk had to be measured and explained. In some cases we would study an investment for more than a year before we would pull the trigger. I'm excited to bring some of those same risk-management skills from the board room to main street.\" Prior to Apple, Johnson was chief investment officer  for the City of San Diego, managing operating funds and bond proceeds for America's seventh largest city. As a managing director for the investment management, consulting, and technology firm Wilshire Associates, Mark Lewis managed the fixed-income analytics business development and client relations teams in Santa Monica, Chicago, New York, London and Singapore. Wilshire's clients included central banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, state retirement boards, universities and governments. At Adherence Capital Management  the co-founders have unique experience in a complex global market, and they conduct rigorous daily research using the same robust risk management tools used by Fortune 50 companies. The resulting investment strategies are tailored for clients who seek diversified all asset investment portfolios, institutions seeking fixed income portfolio management and advice, or individuals wanting tax-exempt municipal bond portfolios.

"content": "RBCC and n3D Market New iPhone App to Dramatically Shorten Drug Toxicity Testing Business Wire NOKOMIS, Fla. -- August 21, 2013 Biotech innovator Rainbow Coral Corp.  and its joint venture partner Nano3D Biosciences  are combining on the worldwide marketing and distribution of a new technology that makes testing a drugs potency and toxicity faster and easier. Nano3D is the developer of a new automated toxicity assay that harnesses the multi-function computing power of the Apple  iPod to test a drugs effects by capturing and charting cell migration data. The Experiment Assistant app, when used with n3Ds n3Dock Station and 3D cell culturing technology, organizes and takes time-lapse images of 3D cell culture growth and migration in the presence of a drug. Through automation, the BiO Assay system can produce drug toxicity results with minimal effort from researchers in 24 hours, in contrast to the 10 days such tests require using current methods. The Experiment Assistant app is going to absolutely slash the time necessary to conduct drug testing, which means pharmaceutical companies will soon be able to get their cutting-edge products to the millions who need them faster, said RBCC CEO Patrick Brown. Were currently consulting with n3D on a worldwide marketing and distribution plan that could make this technology the new standard in testing labs all over the globe.

"content": "//'); //]]> You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play // Nasdaq Halt Shows Failsafes Not Enough, Trader Says Computer breakdowns shook American equity markets again today as malfunctioning software that feeds data between exchanges prompted Nasdaq Stock Market to halt trading in thousands of stocks and options. Nasdaq said trading for all its listed stocks will resume by about 3:25 p.m. following a 15-minute quote-only period, according to a statement on its website. Nasdaq said earlier that trading in shares it lists had been stopped amid issues at its Securities Information Processor, the feed that disseminates quotes and prices. The second-biggest stock market operator in the U.S. halted transactions in what it calls Tape C, which comprises all Nasdaq-listed securities. Buying and selling in many of the countrys most heavily traded shares from Apple Inc. to Intel Corp. and Facebook Inc. ground to a virtual halt as brokers were unable to execute customer orders. The Nasdaq 100 equity index stopped moving shortly after noon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., continued to update. The disruption, just two days after options markets were roiled by mistaken trades sent by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is the latest in a series of computer malfunctions that have raised questions about the reliability of electronic markets. Nasdaq faced criticism last year when its computers mishandled the public debut of Facebook, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for its member firms. Headache This is just another one of those headaches that are going on with this electronic stuff, Frank Ingarra, head trader at Greenwich, Connecticut-based NorthCoast Asset Management LLC, said in a phone interview. Thats why it is important that you have multiple venues. The action froze stocks both on Nasdaqs platforms and dozens of other markets around the country that trade securities it lists. Companies from Bats Global Markets Inc. in Lenexa, Kansas, to Jersey City, New Jersey-based Direct Edge Holdings published notices saying they were adopting Nasdaqs halt. Even though the action was specific to stocks Nasdaq hosts, it depressed volume marketwide. Securities on Nasdaq have a combined market capitalization of more than $5 trillion, based on the value of the 2,446-member Nasdaq Composite Index. For securities that list on the New York Stock Exchange, it was business as usual, according to Sara Rich, a spokeswoman. Trading Breakdowns The breakdown is one of a growing number of trading failures that have coincided with the expanding complexity of global financial markets. U.S. equity trading, which began with on Wall Street more than two centuries ago and was dominated by the New York Stock Exchange, has become dispersed among more than 50 computerized platforms accessible around the world. It has essentially halted trading, Ian Winer, director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc., said in an interview. We cannot execute customer orders in any Nasdaq security so we are basically in a wait-and-see mode from Nasdaq. Signs of strain appeared earlier when NYSEs Arca canceled orders for Nasdaq shares and other exchanges routed orders away from the electronic platform through a procedure known as self-help. Just before 12:30 p.m., shares of Yahoo! Inc. briefly plunged more than a dollar over about a dozen trades. Intel surged 20 cents or more in a handful of transactions. Close Contact We are monitoring the situation and are in close contact with the exchanges, SEC spokesman John Nester said. Options markets were bombarded with erroneous orders two days ago when an internal computer at Goldman Sachs malfunctioned. Options officials at Nasdaq as well as NYSE Amex and CBOE Holdings spent almost a day reviewing orders for cancellation.. In May, Nasdaq agreed to pay $10 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges related to the initial public offering of Facebook. Regulators cited it for its poor systems and decision-making during the IPO in May 2012 that was delayed when software the collects orders fell into a loop. Nasdaq agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SECs findings. Facebook Fine The SEC penalty was imposed because Nasdaq failed in its obligation to ensure that systems, processes and contingency planning are robust and adequate to manage an IPO without disruption to the market, the agency said. Legislation that created the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934 also deemed the main venues self-regulatory organizations, or SROs, overseeing their member firms and trading. Critics said the Facebook mishap shows how changes in the structure of markets have made old regulations obsolete and that firms such as Nasdaq should be regulated by any other for-profit company. Exchanges have close to absolute immunity for actions taken as part of their regulatory duties. The doctrine arose when exchanges were not-for-profit organizations owned by their member firms. The shield protects them from lawsuits related to the exercise of powers delegated by the SEC and prevents financial losses that could jeopardize institutions seen as vital to the U.S. economy.

"title": "Disney Opening Sabotaged by Fake Tickets, Balky Plumbers - Bloomberg", 
"author": "Christopher Palmeri", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "Walts dream is a nightmare. Crowds gripe over long waiting lines. Opening day was a confused mess. These were the first newspaper reviews of Disneyland, the California theme park that debuted one scorching day in July 1955. As a junior publicist hired a month earlier, Marty Sklar had an inside view of the event which included womens heels stuck in the hot asphalt, not enough water fountains due to a plumbers strike and attendance double what was planned because of ticket counterfeiting. He remembers Davy Crockett star Fess Parker, mounted on his steed, pleading: Marty, help me get out of here before this horse kills somebody. Sklar escorted them both backstage. Disneys PR staff turned things around by inviting the press to come back at night, when the park wasnt so crowded. Sklar went on to become president of the Walt Disney Co. s Imagineering unit, which designs the companys parks and hotels, and has now written a memoir called Dream It! Do It! . In an interview, he described the companys early days and why the worlds largest licensor may never lend its name to a car. Palmeri: What was it like to work with Walt? Sklar: He was not the kind of person who would pat you on the back and say Great idea. He just expected it. Dick Irvine  was a master at getting something in position, something Walt could build on. Walt loved plus-ing other peoples ideas. That was exciting to be around. No Games Palmeri: What were meetings like? Sklar: I remember we had an idea for an electronic shooting gallery set in outer space. We spent an hour describing it and the characters. Walt didnt say a word. Finally, he got up and said Is that all they do? We all understood the signal. It never was a game. Palmeri: Another idea that didnt work was a Disney car. Sklar: We found that teenage boys had no interest in riding in a Disney car. No one wanted to hear that a kid was killed or injured in an accident. It was something you dont want to have to deal with. Palmeri: Disney has taken a lot of chances, though. Sklar: We learned by doing. We tried a lot of things at Disneyland that didnt work. The things that worked became traditions. The biggest thing about Walt Disney was that he did not do sequels. He did not want to follow himself. Movie Links Palmeri: In the early days Disney created original park attractions like Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion. Today a new ride is much more likely to be linked to movie content. Sklar: When you can attach great stories to an attraction, why not? Having great Pixar stories to use, or other Disney films, its really quite an advantage. Cars Land -- what a fabulous addition. I love going there at night, all those neon signs. And the ride itself is one of the best weve done. Palmeri: One of the things that comes out in your book is that some countries want their park to reflect the local culture and some dont. Sklar: The Japanese said dont Japanize us. We came to you for Disney. We came to you for America. Tokyo Disneyland didnt even have a Japanese restaurant when it opened. The French said, We have the greatest culture in the world. You get different attitudes in different places. All of Walts stories were out of Europe. Snow White was German; Mary Poppins, English. In Shanghai theyre paying a lot more attention to the Chinese culture. Palmeri: Your career has taken some turns. You started out as a publicist and ended up running a group that included engineers, designers and M.B.A.s. Sklar: Too many M.B.A.s. I tell young people: Learn as much as you can, about as much as you can, when youre young. Thats the time to find out what you really want to do. If youre not having fun in the fun business, find something else to do. To buy this book in North America, click here.  Muse highlights include Ryan Sutton on dining and Patrick Cole on philanthropy.

"author": "Alex Barinka", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "U.S. stocks fell, giving the Dow Jones Industrial Average its longest slump in 13 months, as minutes of the Federal Reserves July meeting showed officials support stimulus cuts this year if the economy improves. Staples Inc.  plunged 15 percent after declines in its retail and international business sparked in a reduction in its earnings forecast. Target Corp. slid 3.6 percent as profit fell 13 percent amid consumers caution in the face of higher taxes and unsteady employment. Lowes Cos. jumped 3.9 percent after the second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer raised its full-year projection amid a housing recovery. The Standard & Poors 500 Index  lost 0.6 percent to 1,642.80 at 4 p.m. in New York, the lowest since July 8. The Dow dropped 105.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 14,897.55. The measure retreated for a sixth day, the longest losing streak since July 2012. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges today, 11 percent below the three-month average. The Fed minutes continue to show this clear uncertainty as to when the monetary tightening will begin, Erik Davidson, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank in San Francisco, said in a phone interview. His firm oversees $170 billion. It will be a seminal moment when they move from the easing theyve been in for years toward some incremental tightening steps. The minutes are quite clear in the sense that the Fed doesnt know that we are there yet where the process can begin. Mixed Reaction The S&P 500 fluctuated after the Fed released its minutes at 2 p.m. in Washington, with the gauge at one point erasing losses of as much as 0.8 percent. Growing concern that the Fed would reduce stimulus this year contributed to the indexs 3.4 percent drop from a record close on Aug. 2 through yesterday. Fed monetary support helped propel the benchmark gauge up more than 150 percent from its bear-market low in 2009. The Federal Open Market Committees minutes from the July 30-31 gathering released today showed officials were broadly comfortable with Chairman Ben S. Bernankes plan to start reducing bond buying later this year, with a few saying tapering might be needed soon. FOMC participants continued to expect economic growth to pick up in the second half of 2013 and strengthen further. After the July meeting, policy makers affirmed a pledge to continue stimulus until seeing signs the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially. July hiring data, released after the meeting, showed the smallest jobs gain in four months and the lowest jobless rate in more than four years. Economic Data Data tomorrow is expected to show that initial jobless claims rose last week, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A report today indicated that sales of previously owned U.S. homes climbed more than forecast in July to the fastest pace since November 2009 as more buyers entered the market. Speculation about the stimulus has whipsawed stocks since May, when Bernanke first indicated cuts could start this year. The benchmark index tumbled 5.8 percent from a record high on May 21 through June 24. It then rebounded as much as 8.7 percent to the latest closing record of 1,709.67. Everybody is edgy right now, Mark Lehmann, president of JMP Securities LLC in San Francisco, said in a phone interview. People are not convinced about what to do, so youre susceptible to big intraday market swings like today, he said. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX , jumped 6.9 percent to 15.94 today, the highest since July 3. The equity volatility gauge erased an earlier gain of 11 percent, falling as much as 1.6 percent before reversing. Earnings, Dividends Investors have also been keeping an eye on corporate earnings, which have helped the S&P 500 rally 16 percent this year through yesterday. Of the 474 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported results this period, 72 percent have posted profit that surpassed estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. All 10 S&P 500 main industries fell today. Utility and phone stocks dropped the most, sliding 1.2 percent, as yields on 10-year Treasury notes traded near the highest level in two years, cutting demand for dividends. Utility companies offer a dividend yield of 4.1 percent, ranking the highest among 10 industries after telephone stocks. The two groups slumped more than 7.6 percent in the past three months, the most in the index. Staples tumbled 15 percent, the most in more than two years, to $14.27. The worlds largest office-supplies chain, which suffers from waning consumer demand for products such as ink and toner and computer accessories, cut its outlook after second-quarter results were weaker than it expected. Target, PetSmart Target dropped 3.6 percent to $65.50, the lowest since March 1. The second-largest U.S. discount retailer joins Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Macys Inc. in reporting results that showed the bumpy economy and increased Social Security taxes are making consumers reluctant to spend beyond necessities. PetSmart Inc.  dropped 5.3 percent to $71. The pet-store chain forecast earnings of 83 cents to 87 cents a share in the third quarter. Analysts, on average, estimated 87 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey. American Eagle Outfitters Inc. plunged 9.9 percent to $14.76. The clothing retailers second-quarter sales fell short of analyst estimates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell 1.5 percent to $157.11. A programming error caused the firm to send unintentional stock options orders in the first minutes of trading, pushing prices on dozens of contracts to a dollar each, according to a person briefed on the matter yesterday and data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Trades Any losses for Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, wont be known until exchanges determine which contracts should be canceled, said the person, who requested anonymity because the information is private. Lowes  rose 4.3 percent to $45.97. The second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer posted second-quarter profit that topped analysts estimates and raised its forecast for the year as the housing recovery fuels spending on remodeling. Garmin Ltd.  climbed 5.6 percent to $40.59 for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. The largest maker of navigation devices was boosted to neutral from sell at Goldman Sachs. Incyte Corp. surged 35 percent to $36.45, the highest since November 2000. The drugmaker said a Phase 2 study indicated its Jakafi inhibitor showed a benefit for treating patients with pancreatic cancer.

"content": "//'); //]]> You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play // Detroit Dominated by Pitbulls as 50K Dogs Roam Free As many as 50,000 stray dogs roam the streets and vacant homes of bankrupt Detroit, replacing residents, menacing humans who remain and overwhelming the citys ability to find them homes or peaceful deaths. Dens of as many as 20 canines have been found in boarded-up homes in the community of about 700,000 that once pulsed with 1.8 million people. One officer in the Police Department's skeleton animal-control unit recalled a pack splashing away in a basement that flooded when thieves ripped out water pipes. SLIDESHOW: Detroit's Abandoned DogsThe dogs were having a pool party, said Lapez Moore, 30. We went in and fished them out. Poverty roils the Motor City and many dogs have been left to fend for themselves, abandoned by owners who are financially stressed or unaware of proper care. Strays have killed pets, bitten mail carriers and clogged the animal shelter, where more than 70 percent are euthanized. With these large open expanses with vacant homes, its as if you designed a situation that causes dog problems, said Harry Ward, head of animal control. Symbiotic Suffering The number of strays signals a humanitarian crisis, said Amanda Arrington of the Humane Society of the United States, based in Washington. She heads a program that donated $50,000 each to organizations in Detroit and nine other U.S cities to get pets vaccinated, fed, spayed and neutered. Arrington said when she visited Detroit in October, It was almost post-apocalyptic, where there are no businesses, nothing except people in houses and dogs running around. The suffering of animals goes hand in hand with the suffering of people. She said pet owners who move leave behind dogs, hoping neighbors will care for them. Those dogs take to the streets and reproduce. Compounding that are the estimated 70,000 vacant buildings that provide shelter for dogs, or where some are chained without care to ward off thieves, Ward said. Most strays are pets that roam, often in packs that form around a female in heat, Ward said. Few are true feral dogs that have had no human contact. Ward said Detroits three shelters -- his and two non-profit facilities -- take in 15,000 animals a year, including strays and pets that are seized or given up by owners. Fearing Humans They are among the victims of a historic financial and political collapse. Detroit, a former auto manufacturing powerhouse, declared the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy on July 18 after years of decline. The city has more than $18 billion in long-term debt and had piled up an operating deficit of close to $400 million. Falling revenue forced cutbacks in police, fire-fighting -- and dog control. With an annual budget of $1.6 million, Ward has four officers to cover the 139-square-mile  city seven days a week, 11 fewer than when he took command in 2008. He has one dog-bite investigator, down from three. We are really suffering from fatigue, short staffed and work too much overtime, he said in an interview. The officers, who wear bulletproof vests to protect themselves from irate owners, are bringing in about half the number of animals that crews did in 2008, Ward said. In July, the pound stopped accepting more animals for a month because the city hadnt paid a service that hauls away euthanized animals for cremation at a cost of about $20,000 a year. The freezers were packed with carcasses, and pens were full of live animals until the bill was paid. Famous Fighter Pit bulls and breeds mixed with them dominate Detroits stray population because of widespread dog fighting, said Ward. Males are aggressive in mating, so they proliferate, he added. One type of fighting pit bull has become known as far as Los Angeles as the Highland Park red, named after a city within Detroits borders, Ward said. Their prevalence was clear as Ward and officers Moore and Malachi Jackson answered calls Aug. 19. On a block where vacant houses and lots outnumbered occupied ones, they found four dogs in an abandoned house -- a male and three females, including a pregnant pit bull with a prized blue-gray coat. Ward said it appeared the dogs were fed by someone who used the house to hide stolen items. Walking Small Aggressive dogs force the U.S. Postal Service to temporarily halt mail delivery in some neighborhoods, said Ed Moore, a Detroit-area spokesman. He said there were 25 reports of mail carriers bitten by dogs in Detroit from October through July. Though most are by pets at homes, strays have also attacked, Moore said. Its been a persistent problem, he said. Mail carrier Catherine Guzik told of using pepper spray on swarms of tiny, ferocious dogs in a southwest Detroit neighborhood. Its like Chihuahuaville, Guzik said as she walked her route. At two nearby homes, one pet dog was killed recently and another injured by two stray pit bulls that jumped fences into yards, said neighbor Debora Mattie, 49. Last year, there were 903 dog bites in Detroit, according to Ward, adding that most go unreported to police. He said 90 percent are by dogs whose owners are known. After Attack Many de facto strays are called pets by owners who let them wander, said Kristen Huston, who leads the Detroit office of All About Animals Rescue, a non-profit that obtained the Humane Societys $50,000 grant last year to feed, vaccinate and sterilize pets. Some dogs run away from their neighborhoods and threaten people, she said. Technically, its illegal to let a dog roam, but with the city being bankrupt, whos going to do anything about it? Huston said. Huston said she walks through some of the poorest neighborhoods to talk to pet owners about how to care for their animals, sometimes giving them bags of food or even a free doghouse. Ward said more needs to be done to educate pet owners. He said his crews are too few, but help keep dogs in check. Four months ago, a woman sitting on her porch on the east side was attacked by two strays that tore off her scalp, Ward said. We got those dogs, he said. Its a big difference to that lady that those dogs were gone that day.

"content": "//'); //]]> You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play // FOMC Minutes Show Support for Bernanke Taper Plan Federal Reserve policy makers considering when to reduce bond buying were broadly comfortable with Chairman Ben S. Bernankes plan to taper this year if the economy strengthens, with a few saying a reduction may be needed soon, minutes of their last meeting show. Almost all committee members agreed that a change in the purchase program was not yet appropriate, and a few said it might soon be time to slow somewhat the pace of purchases as outlined in that plan, according to the record of the Federal Open Market Committees July 30-31 gathering released yesterday in Washington. A few members emphasized the importance of being patient and evaluating additional information on the economy before deciding on any changes to the pace of asset purchases, the minutes show. Almost all participants confirmed that they were broadly comfortable with the committee moderating the pace of its securities purchases later this year. The Feds debate over when to taper $85 billion in monthly bond buying has roiled financial markets from Jakarta to Mumbai to New York. Some policy makers have said the purchases, while helping reduce unemployment, are stoking excessive risk taking in assets such as junk bonds and leveraged loans. The minutes suggest that Fed officials are still in line for September tapering, said Michael Gapen, a senior U.S. economist at Barclays Plc in New York, referring to the FOMCs Sept. 17-18 meeting. On Table Theres nothing in the minutes to say its going to September definitively, but then theres little to suggest it isnt on the table, said Gapen, a former researcher in the Feds Division of Monetary Affairs. They didnt seem to want to push the needle much. Stocks extended declines following release of the minutes. The Standard & Poors 500 Index fell 0.6 percent yesterday to 1,642.80, increasing its decline to 3.9 percent since closing at a record on Aug. 2. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 0.08 percentage point to a two-year high of 2.89 percent. Fed officials yesterday also discussed the rise in interest rates following the June FOMC meeting. Some participants indicated that overall financial-market conditions had tightened significantly, the minutes said. They expressed concern that the higher level of longer-term interest rates could be a significant factor holding back spending and economic growth. Several others said the rise in rates was likely to exert relatively little restraint. In addition, these participants thought that rising stock prices and easier bank lending standards would offset the impact of higher borrowing costs. Some of the officials welcomed the rise in rates insofar as those developments were associated with an unwinding of unsustainable speculative positions. Median Estimate The FOMC will probably reduce its monthly purchases at its meeting next month, according to 65 percent of 48 economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey. The median estimate called for a cut to $75 billion each month. Theyll probably start to taper in September, said Josh Feinman, the New York-based global chief economist for Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, which oversees $400 billion. They know that thats widely anticipated, and they havent done anything to deflect those expectations. The Fed staff continued to work on tools for the exit from record stimulus, briefing FOMC participants on the possibility of a fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility as an additional tool for managing money market interest rates. Wide Range Such a tool would allow the FOMC to offer an overnight, risk-free instrument to a wide range of market participants, and possibly improve their ability to keep short-term rates at desired levels, the minutes said. FOMC participants continued to expect economic growth to pick up in the second half of 2013 and strengthen further. The minutes said a number of participants were somewhat less confident than they were in June due to higher mortgage rates, higher oil prices, slow growth in U.S. export markets and the risk that fiscal restraint might not decrease. The FOMC affirmed a pledge on July 31 to continue bond buying until seeing signs the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially. While employers in July expanded payrolls by 162,000 workers, the smallest gain in four months, the jobless rate fell to a more than four-year low. Job Growth Payroll growth over the past six months has averaged almost 200,000, compared with a 141,000 average in the six months before September, when the FOMC announced a third round of bond buying. Also, jobless claims fell to 320,000  in the week ended Aug. 10, the least since October 2007. With inflation well below the FOMCs 2 percent target, policy makers have leeway to press on with bond buying that has pumped up the Feds balance sheet to a record $3.65 trillion. Their preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures index, increased 1.3 percent in the 12 months ended in June. Excluding food and energy, the index rose 1.2 percent. FOMC participants predicted in June that gross domestic product will grow this year from 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent. During the second quarter, GDP rose at a 1.7 percent annualized rate, after a 1.1 percent gain in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department. Stronger U.S. growth and speculation the Fed will scale back bond purchases has helped erase about $1.37 trillion from the value of emerging-market equities in the past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Emerging-market stocks dropped for a fifth day. Indias S&P BSE Sensex and Indonesias Jakarta Composite Index both fell to 11-month lows this week, while Turkeys lira fell to a record low versus the dollar. Fed policy makers are generally much more behind Bernanke than in June, said Derek Holt, vice president of economics at Scotiabank in Toronto. While the prior meeting had almost the hint of a rebellion, that seems to have been reined in this time around and they seem much more supportive of Bernankes public guidance about out how they will proceed.

"content": "U.S. stocks rose on data showing improvement in global manufacturing and the American labor market amid a three-hour trading halt on the Nasdaq Stock Market after a computer error. A gauge of homebuilders added 2.1 percent after a report showed house prices rose 7.7 percent in June from a year ago. Yahoo Inc. rallied 3.2 percent as data showed it attracted more U.S. visitors than Google Inc. in July. Hewlett-Packard Co. slid 12 percent after the personal computer makers quarterly profit forecast missed some analysts estimates. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. plunged 17 percent as second-quarter earnings that fell short of forecasts. The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 1,657.70 at 3:31 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 78.50 points, or 0.5 percent, to 14,976.05. Trading in S&P 500 stocks was 29 percent below the 30-day average at this time of day. Computer errors shook American equity markets again as malfunctioning software that feeds data between exchanges prompted Nasdaq to halt trading in stocks and options today. The Nasdaq rose 0.9 percent to 3,631.17 today before stopped around 12:20 p.m. in New York. Trading resumed at 3:25 p.m., with the Nasdaq up 0.9 percent to 3,632.93. The employment numbers were encouraging and showed a continuation of slow growth in employment, Paul Mangus, head of equity strategy and research for Wells Fargo Private Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in a telephone interview. His firm manages $170 billion. There are signs of stabilization in China and improvement in Europe, which could help U.S. multinationals in the long run. Virtual Halt Buying and selling in many of the countrys most heavily traded shares from Apple Inc. to Intel Corp. and Facebook Inc. ground to a virtual halt today after the second-biggest stock market operator in the U.S. halted transactions in what it calls Tape C, which comprises all Nasdaq-listed securities. The disruption, just two days after options markets were roiled by mistaken trades sent by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is the latest in a series of computer malfunctions that have raised questions about the reliability of electronic markets. Nasdaq faced criticism last year when it mishandled the public debut of Facebook, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for its member firms. The companys shares fell 3.4 percent to $30.47, after earlier rising as much as 1.1 percent. Fed Stimulus The S&P 500  fell 0.6 percent yesterday to the lowest level since July 8 as minutes from the Federal Reserves July meeting showed officials support stimulus cuts this year if the economy improves. The Dow declined for a sixth day, the longest losing streak in 13 months. Fed stimulus helped push the S&P 500 up as much as 153 percent from its March 2009 low, as better-than-estimated corporate earnings also fueled equity gains. Of the 483 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly earnings this period, 71 percent surpassed profit estimates, Bloomberg data show. The fewest workers in more than five years applied for U.S. unemployment benefits over the past month, indicating the labor market continues to improve. The number of claims in the month ended Aug. 17 declined to 330,500 a week on average, the least since November 2007, a Labor Department report showed today in Washington. Compared with a week earlier, claims rose by 13,000 to 336,000, in line with the median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Fluctuations The Fed has said it plans to keep benchmark interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and inflation is no more than 2.5 percent. Speculation about the stimulus has whipsawed stocks since May, when the Fed first indicated cuts could start this year. The S&P 500 tumbled 5.8 percent from a record high on May 21 through June 24. It then rebounded as much as 8.7 percent to close at its latest record of 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. The index finished yesterday 3.9 percent below the all-time high. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, dropped 7.3 percent to 14.77 today, after jumping yesterday to the highest since July 3. The equity volatility gauge has retreated 18 percent this year as the S&P 500 has rallied 16 percent on growing signs economic growth is improving. Data today showed the Conference Boards index of leading economic indicators increased 0.6 percent in July. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.5 percent advance. Overseas Manufacturing Overseas reports showed Germany led growth in manufacturing and services in the euro area, while a gauge for Chinas factory output unexpectedly showed expansion. Energy stocks rallied 1.4 percent and materials producers jumped 1 percent as all 10 main industries in the S&P 500 advanced today. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. surged 6.3 percent to $22.55 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. added 4 percent to $31.57 to pace gains among miners. Industrial metals rallied on the data from China, the worlds biggest consumer of commodities. A factory index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed a preliminary reading of 50.1, exceeding the 48.2 median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50 signal growth. Gold Mines Barrick Gold Corp., the worlds biggest producer of the precious metal, gained 2.8 percent to $19.60. Gold Fields Ltd. said it will pay $300 million for Barricks Granny Smith, Lawlers and Darlot gold mines in Western Australia. The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilding Index rose 2.1 percent. Ten of 11 members advanced, after the Federal Housing Finance Agency report showed home prices extending a recovery. Prices climbed 0.7 percent in the month on a seasonally adjusted basis from May. Toll Brothers Inc. gained 2.9 percent to $32.55 and PulteGroup Inc. climbed 1.6 percent to $16.35. Yahoo, the biggest U.S. Web portal, added 3.2 percent to $27.92. More than 196 million users spent time on Yahoos websites in July, ComScore Inc. said. Thats 4.3 million more than Google Inc. and the first time Yahoos Web traffic surpassed that of the worlds most popular search engine since May 2011. GameStop, H-P GameStop Corp. jumped 9.7 percent to $52.25 for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. The largest specialty retailer of video games gained the most in a year after raising its full-year profit forecast ahead of the release of new consoles from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Hewlett-Packard tumbled 12 percent to $22.29 after forecasting earnings excluding some items of 98 cents to $1.02 a share for the fiscal fourth quarter.

The retailer reported second-quarter earnings of 16 cents a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 29 cents and its own forecast of at least 28 cents. Sears Holding Corp. slumped 8.3 percent to $39.70, headed for the lowest close this year. The retailer controlled by Edward Lampert said its second-quarter loss widened to $194 million as its loyalty program members used more discounts. Members of the companys Shop Your Way program accounted for more than 65 percent of sales at Sears operations and Kmart in the quarter. Sales fell 6.3 percent to $8.87 billion.

"author": "Roger Runningen", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "//'); //]]> You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play // Duncan Says Obama Seeking College-Cost Transparency President Barack Obama, in a bid to restrain escalating higher education expenses, called for tying federal financial aid to a new U.S. government rating of college costs and outcomes. The plan would rank similar colleges against their peers, and students who go to highly rated schools would get more aid than those lower in the pecking order, White House officials said today before Obamas remarks today at the University of Buffalo. Obama vowed to rein in spiraling tuition at a time when more than half of U.S. undergraduates rely on federal aid and student debt is climbing. Average tuition and fees at public four-year colleges have more than tripled in the past three decades, far exceeding gains in family income, according to the White House. College costs have become a barrier and a burden for too many American families, Obama told students and faculty at the universitys arena. He said he plans to shake up the current system with ratings that would show whos offering the best value so students and taxpayers get better bang for their buck. The Education Department would be directed to develop a rating system to be in place before the 2015 school year, and the president will ask Congress for legislation that would dole out financial aid based on those ratings by 2018, Obama said. While the administration could produce a ranking on its own, changes in federal aid would require congressional approval. More Aid The federal government provides more than $150 billion a year in federal student aid, awarding it based on the number of students who enroll, rather than the number who earn degrees or what they learn, the White House said. Obama has already called for giving more federal financial aid to colleges with moderate tuition increases and strong educational outcomes -- such as high graduation rates -- and yanking funding from those with the highest cost. That plan focused on expanding Perkins loans, a program for low-income families, and using the money as a lever to hold down costs. The White House said the new ratings would be based on such measures as access, including the percentage of students receiving Pell grants, reserved for those from lower-income families; affordability, including average tuition, scholarships and loan debt; and outcomes, such as graduation and transfer rates, earnings of graduates and graduates advanced degrees. Rich Folks College has never been more expensive, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said today on Bloomberg Television. Hard-working middle-class folks no longer feel that college is worth it anymore -- its for rich folks. The federal government already gathers reams of information to develop such a ranking, and the administration has produced a College Scorecard with data on cost and student debt. Colleges have objected to proposals to tie aid to cost and educational outcomes because of concern that certain institutions -- and their students -- would be unfairly penalized. The government will have no trouble producing a ranking with the data it has available, said Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the Washington-based American Council on Education, which represents 1,800 college presidents. But it will be contentious to figure out how to use it to provide aid to students, Hartle said. For-Profit Colleges The administration already tried to crack down on for-profit colleges by cutting off aid from those whose students take on heavy debts that dont pay off with higher incomes. The industry lobbied heavily against the plan and successfully fought against the rules in court, saying they were arbitrary and would hurt low-income students. Part of their argument was that the rules targeted for-profit colleges and should apply more broadly, as the new plan would. As borrowers buckle under more than $1 trillion in student loans, Obama has repeatedly emphasized that higher education is the pathway to future prosperity for middle- and lower-income Americans. The president began a two-day bus trip focusing on college costs, which will take him through parts of upstate New York and northeast Pennsylvania hit by the decline in U.S. manufacturing. Planned stops in Buffalo, Syracuse and Binghamton in New York and Scranton, Pennsylvania, will mark the fourth in a series of campaign-style trips Obama has made outside of Washington since mid-July to promote proposals on housing, jobs and education. With members of Congress still on a monthlong break, Obama is seeking to control the public agenda before coming battles over the budget and the governments debt limit. Political Battle What were seeing here is not so much a chance to pass legislation but setting the stage for the 2014 midterm elections, said Charles Franklin, a former political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and co-founder of Pollster.Com. They are issues that the president is staking out for himself and for Democrats. In addition to linking funding to cost increases and outcomes, Obama has previously pushed for colleges to offer standard financial-aid award letters, so students can easily compare offers. A number of colleges, including the State University of New York system, have voluntarily signed on to that effort. In its new proposal, the administration reiterated a call for $1 billion Race to the Top college grants, modeled after an elementary and high school program that pushed states to agree to the White Houses education agenda. Under the college version, states that promote affordability could win money. Online Programs Obama would also give a financial incentive to enroll students eligible for Pell Grants. To prevent waste, the money would require colleges with high dropout rates to dole out aid over the course of the semester, rather than a lump sum. The president would also encourage colleges to award credit based on what is learned, rather than time in classes. He cited such low-cost online programs at Western Governors University, Southern New Hampshire University and the University of Wisconsin system. Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs, offered by Harvard, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, could play a key role, the White House said. On the matter of student debt, Obama proposes to make all students eligible for plans that let them repay loans based on how much they earn -- capped at 10 percent of monthly income. Currently, about 2 million of 37 million student-loan borrows are benefitting from such income repayment plans. Debt Collectors Debt collectors, paid on commission and hired by the federal government, have faced complaints that they insist on high payments even when borrowers incomes make them eligible for leniency, Bloomberg News reported in March 2012. In March, the Education Department changed companies commission structure to encourage them to offer income-based repayments. Still, a growing student-loan debt relief industry is profiting from consumers ignorance of such plans, charging as much as $1,600 to sign them up, according to a June report by the Boston-based National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy and research group. Under the presidents plan, the Education Department will start a campaign this fall of calling borrowers who have fallen behind on their payments and encourage them to sign up for affordable repayment options. Next year, the government would help them do so when they file their taxes. Obamas choice of sites gave an indication of what he will stress as a solution to rising college costs. State University of New York Chancellor Nancy Zimpher was among the first universities to sign onto the administrations Know Before You Owe financial-aid initiative. Affordable Education The University of Buffalo and Binghamton University, both part of the New York university system, are two of Obamas stops. He also plans to make remarks at Henninger High School in Syracuse and Lackawanna College in Scranton. The SUNY system has among the highest graduation rates and lowest costs in the country, said spokesman David Doyle. For the 2013-14 school year, the in-state cost of attendance, including room and board, is $22,700. The system is also developing an online initiative to grant online bachelors degrees in three years and masters in four, he said. We deliver affordable, high-quality education, Binghamton University President Harvey Stenger said in a phone interview. Were doing the things the president wants to talk about.

"content": "TiVo Inc. , looking to stem a decline in retail sales of its digital video recorders, introduced new set-top boxes that offer more storage space and greater ability to stream shows to mobile devices. The Roamio line, which goes on sale today, replaces TiVos Premiere models with features like Wi-fi that were previously sold separately, according to a statement. A faster processor means services like Netflix will take less time to appear on screens, and customers can record as many as six programs at a time, storing as much as 450 hours of HD content. We asked ourselves, if you just want to have the best TV experience possible, what can we do? Jim Denny, vice president of product marketing at San Jose, California-based TiVo, said in an interview. The pioneer of ad-skipping DVRs sells its own set-top boxes and also licenses its technology to pay-TV providers such as DirecTV  and Comcast Corp. that rent units to subscribers. To shore up the slowing retail business, TiVo is selling customers a box that offers the latest viewing technologies for $200 to $600, plus a monthly service fee of $15. Included in all three Roamio models is Wi-fi, which used to cost $90 as a separate accessory. The two higher-priced units also include Stream, a $130 add-on that previously let users view content on tablets and smartphones in the home. Now it will deliver some shows and near-live TV outside the home, similar to the Slingbox feature on Dish Network Corp.s Hopper, according to Denny. The Premiere model sells for $150 to $400, with fewer features. Viewing Experience TiVo rose 4.7 percent to $10.98 at 11:13 a.m. in New York, after touching $10.99 for the biggest intraday gain in more than two months. Through yesterday, the shares had declined 15 percent this year. The company has lost retail customers as pay-TV services offer more streaming and on-demand video options, and develop mobile software for so-called TV Everywhere viewing seen on Apple Inc.  iPads and Android devices. As of April 30, 1 million customers had their own TiVo set-top box, a drop of 14 percent since July 2011. Those who use TiVo software through monthly pay-TV accounts increased by 277,000 during the first quarter. Retail sales are important for TiVos profitability because the company receives a higher share of service revenue than from partnerships with pay-TV providers. The newest machines also provide a platform for the company to promote its latest technology, Chief Executive Officer Tom Rogers said in June. The Roamio also acts as a server that can download Web applications and send shows to smaller companion boxes throughout the home.

"content": "China Telecom Corp. , the countrys third-biggest mobile phone operator by users, posted its second-straight gain in quarterly profit as subscribers with Apple Inc. s iPhone helped boost data usage. Net income rose 21 percent to 5.52 billion yuan  in the second quarter, from 4.55 billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement today. That beat the 5.25 billion-yuan average of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chairman Wang Xiaochu is benefiting from an increase in users of third-generation mobile services and rising sales of data packages to download games and movies after introducing the iPhone last year. With 50 percent of its subscribers on 3G, China Telecom has surpassed both its larger rivals, China Mobile Ltd.  and China Unicom  Ltd., by that measure. Profits are slightly higher than we expected, Anand Ramachandran, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Barclays Plc., wrote in a report to clients today. Sales are boosted as the proportion of higher average revenue per user 3G subscriber rises. Sales in the second quarter rose 14 percent to 79.7 billion yuan, the company said. That compares with the average of 80.7 billion yuan in the Bloomberg survey. 3G Users China Telecom rose 1.5 percent to HK$4.08 at 1:50 p.m. in Hong Kong trading. The stock has dropped 5.3 percent this year, compared with a 3.8 percent decline in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. China Telecom last year said the iPhone would help it achieve long-term sustainable growth even as it caused short-term pressure on profitability. The company reported three straight declines in net income until last quarter, when it resumed growth. In the second quarter, the companys mobile unit added 9.26 million 3G users, bringing it to 87.3 million. That represents half of its total wireless subscriber base of 174.5 million. China Telecom ranks behind China Mobile and China Unicom in wireless users. China Mobile, the worlds biggest wireless carrier with 740 million subscribers, has 19 percent of its customers on 3G. About 38 percent of China Unicoms 262 million users are on the faster network, according to data the carriers released last month. As the 3G subscribers offer higher average revenue per user, the quality of customers is better for China Telecom, Ricky Lai, an analyst at Guotai Junan International Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a phone interview yesterday. China Telecom entered the wireless market in 2008 by acquiring the smaller of China Unicoms two mobile divisions in a government-led revamp of the nations mobile-phone industry. China Mobile this month posted a 2.5 percent rise in second-quarter profit as costs to add new subscribers to its third-generation network restrained growth. China Unicom posted posted a 41 percent jump in net income for the period. Both sets of results exceeded analyst estimates.

"content": "A patent-licensing company sued by Vermont officials for sending threatening letters has agreed not to target businesses in Minnesota, state Attorney General Lori Swanson said. MPHJ Technology Investments LLC, which is registered in Wilmington, Delaware, claims that anyone who scans documents to be e-mailed infringes its patents for the technology. It has sent thousands of letters nationwide to companies and nonprofit organizations demanding as much as $1,200 per employee to avoid patent-infringement lawsuits. The settlement limiting the firms ability to contact Minnesota residents and businesses is believed to be the first of its kind against a company derided as a troll for its licensing tactics, the state said yesterday. Vermont has sued the company under state consumer protection laws. Retailers have reported a rise in letters demanding compensation for using common technology such as Wi-Fi connections to the Internet, tracking customer shipments and adding maps to website. President Barack Obama has backed legislative proposals to curb lawsuits against users of technology and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is considering a broad inquiry into whether the tactics hamper innovation and competition. To send any further letters to Minnesota businesses, MPHJ must give the attorney generals office 60 days notice and obtain its consent, according to the agreement. They cant do what theyve been doing, said Ben Wogsland, a spokesman for the attorney generals Office. Theyre going to have a steep, steep row to hoe to convince Attorney General Swanson they have something legitimate here. The agreement doesnt restrict the companys ability to file patent-infringement suits, nor does it involve any allegations of wrongdoing, MPHJ said in an e-mailed statement. MPHJ welcomes this review process, as the questions that have been raised by the Minnesota AG went to the form of MPHJs licensing and infringement inquiry letters, not the substance, and MPHJ prefers any such immaterial issues to be resolved in advance, so that it can focus on its lawful licensing activity without further interference, according to the statement. Apple Gets Patent on Touch Screen Gesture-Capture Technology Apple Inc. , maker of the iPhone and the IPad, received a patent on a technology that would capture the gestures of a user whose hands are hovering above a touch screen. Patent 8,514,221 was issued yesterday, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. According to the patent, a two-dimensional object is presented in the user interface. The technology then detects movement in proximity to the screens surface, which will then generate a three-dimensional object that can be manipulated by the user through gestures. Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said the technology would be useful for computer-assisted design, providing a tool for generating and manipulating a three-dimensional object. Features of this interface allow a user to quickly and intuitively generate, modify, and manipulate 3D objects and virtual 3D environments, according to the patent. Apple applied for the patent in July 2012 with assistance from Philadelphias Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP. For more patent news, click here. Trademark EA Asks Appeals Court to Delay Ruling on College Athletes Suit Electronic Arts Inc.  urged a federal appeals court in California to put on hold a ruling that bars a First Amendment defense to lawsuits accusing the company of profiting from using likenesses of college athletes. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled the opposite in a similar case and said the company was constitutionally protected from claims by college athletes who allege EA violated their rights by using their likenesses in video games, company lawyers said in an Aug. 19 filing. Electronic Arts intends to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review both rulings and asked that the July 31 decision by the San Francisco-based court, which takes effect Aug. 21, be put on hold for 90 days to allow the company to petition the high court, said Kelli Sager, an EA attorney, in the filing. In a 2-1 ruling in a case brought in 2009 by former Arizona State University quarterback Sam Keller, the San Francisco-based court said EA wasnt protected against Kellers suit because its NCAA Football games, which use athletes height, weight, hair color and skin tone, though not their names, literally creates Keller in the very setting in which he has achieved renown. Former student basketball and football players allege that Electronic Arts and the NCAA, the governing body of most U.S. intercollegiate sports, conspired to use their likenesses in video games without their permission and without paying them, violating antitrust law and their rights of publicity. Robert Carey, an attorney representing Keller, said he opposes EAs request. Once the ruling takes effect, Kellers lawyers will begin requesting documents from EA to prepare for trial, he said by phone. Weve been waiting a long, long time to proceed with the case, Carey said. The case is Keller v. Electronic Arts, 10-15387, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . Richemonts Montblanc-Simplo Sues 10 Websites for Infringement Richemont International SAs Montblanc-Simplo unit, maker of luxury fountain pens that sell for as much as $1,150, sued 10 websites claim they infringe its trademarks. The websites were registered by a resident of Nanjing, China, the Hamburg, Germany-based company said in the complaint filed Aug. 16 in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. The domain names listed in the complaint all contain montblanc or montblancpen, and were so named in a bad faith attempt to profit off of the fame, reputation and goodwill of the Montblanc brand, the company said. The accused websites arent used to sell genuine Montblanc products, according to court papers. Instead, Montblanc claims they are offering for sale inferior products that confuse consumers and tarnish the name of the company. The company said that the websites operators havent responded to infringement notices or cease-and-desist letters sent to the contact information provided by the Internet domain registrar, as well as to the contact information identified on the various websites. It asked the court to transfer the offending domain names to London-based Richemont and seeks an award of attorney fees. The case is Montblanc-Simplo GmbH v. Achatstyleomontblanc.com, 1:13-cv-01013, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia . For more trademark news, click here. Copyright NCS Pearson Victory in Copyright Case Over Test Upheld NCS Pearson Inc., a provider of educational and testing software, properly defeated a physical therapists copyright claim over a psychological test, an appeals court ruled. The U.S. Appeals Court in Denver on Aug. 19 affirmed a lower courts ruling that Judith Copeland Cooper brought her copyright ownership claims too late. The appeals court said that it was undisputed that Cooper became aware in 1996 that she wasnt receiving royalties for the test, putting her on notice of the basis for a copyright co-ownership claim. The statute of limitations for her to make her claim expired by 1999 at the latest, the appeals court said. Cooper sued Bloomington, Minnesota-based NCS Pearson in federal court in Denver in 2010. The case is Cooper v. NCS Pearson Inc., 12-01096, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. The lower court case is Cooper v.

"author": "Shobhana Chandra", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "//'); //]]> You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play // Jobless Claims in U.S. Fell to Five-Year Low The fewest workers in more than five years applied for U.S. unemployment benefits over the past month, indicating the labor market continues to improve. The number of claims in the month ended Aug. 17 declined to 330,500 a week on average, the least since November 2007, a Labor Department report showed today in Washington. Compared with a week earlier, claims rose by 13,000 to 336,000, in line with the median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Firings are waning as employers hold on to workers to meet sales, which may be a precursor to bigger gains in payrolls once the effects of federal budget cuts and higher payroll taxes fade in the second half of 2013. Growth in employment, together with rising incomes, will help buoy consumer confidence and spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. There is legitimate improvement in the labor market, said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moodys Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Its more important to put the emphasis on the trend in claims, which remains favorable. Stock-index futures held earlier gains after the report. The contract on the Standard & Poors 500 Index maturing in September rose 0.4 percent to 1,643.6 at 8:38 a.m. in New York. The four-week moving average is a less volatile measure than the weekly figures, and is considered a better gauge of the trend in applications. Survey Results The median forecast of economists surveyed projected a gain in claims to 330,000. Estimates ranged from 315,000 to 350,000. The Labor Department revised the previous weeks figure to 323,000 from an initially reported 320,000. No states were estimated last week and there was nothing unusual with the data, a Labor Department spokesman said as the figures were released to the press. Last week included the 12th of the month, which coincides with the period the Labor Department surveys employers to calculate monthly payroll data. The four-week average was down from the 346,500 average during the comparable period in July. The employment report for August will be released on Sept. 6. The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits increased by 29,000 to 3 million in the week ended Aug. 10. The continuing claims figure does not include the number of Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs. Extended Benefits Those whove used up their traditional benefits and are now collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about 51,800 to 1.5 million in the week ended Aug. 3. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits held at 2.3 percent in the week ended Aug. 10, the report showed. Twenty-eight states and territories reported a decrease in claims, while 25 reported an increase. These data are reported with a one-week lag. Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and typically wane before job growth can accelerate. Employers in July added the fewest number of workers in four months, even as the jobless rate dropped to a more than four-year low of 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent, the Labor Department reported earlier this month. Regional data showed a mixed picture for July. Payrolls increased in 32 states last month, and the jobless rate climbed in 28, according to Labor Department figures released on Aug. 19. California led the nation with the biggest gain in payrolls, followed by Georgia, though unemployment rose in both states. Cutting Staff Companies trimming their workforce include Cisco Systems Inc. , the biggest maker of networking equipment. The San Jose, California-based company on Aug. 14 said it is cutting 4,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its workforce as weaker sales in Japan, China and Europe weigh on revenue growth. Hiring may get some lift as smaller employers see signs of an increase in demand. Confidence among small businesses improved in July to its second-highest level in a year as managers became less pessimistic about sales, according to data from the National Federation of Independent Business. Federal Reserve officials are watching the job market along with other economic data to determine when to begin scaling back the central banks $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. In July, policy makers affirmed a pledge to continue the purchase program until they saw signs that the outlook for the labor market had improved substantially. Minutes of the Feds meeting, released yesterday, showed officials were broadly comfortable with Chairman Ben S. Bernankes plan to start the so-called tapering later this year if the economy improves, with a few saying the reduction might be needed soon. The trimming will probably begin at the Feds Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of 48 economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey.

"author": "", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "iPad and Samsung Galaxy Gain Market Share as Kindle Fire Sputters Jumptap August MobileSTAT Illustrates Apples Market Hold Business Wire BOSTON -- August 22, 2013 In its newly released August MobileSTAT, Jumptap, Inc., the leading unified audience platform, reports on top mobile trends and market share growth. According to data on the Jumptap platform, Apple continues to hold the top spot in tablet market share, but its chief competitor in the smartphone sector, Samsung, is starting to make a run. The Samsung Galaxy Tab jumped 5.8 percentage points in market share year-over-year. Meanwhile, Kindle Fire, which was the hottest challenger to Apple after Christmas 2011, has cooled down, losing 11.4 percentage points in market share. Additionally, Googles Nexus is finally on the radar after releasing three generations of its first tablet in just one year. Previously, the iOS vs. Android battle could not crown a standing victor for Android, said Matt Duffy, VP of Marketing at Jumptap. Yet in the past year, weve seen Samsung rise above the pack in both tablet and smartphone share. Additional August MobileSTAT Findings: *iPod Losing Touch: According to data from the Jumptap platform of over 218 million U.S. consumers, the iPhone continues to grow as the top smart device, and has increased its share by 9.6 percentage points year-over-year. Its step-sister, the iPod Touch, has lost share a significant 10.1 percentage points signaling that consumers are beginning to see less value in a smart device without phone call capabilities. Meanwhile, Samsung devices, led by the Galaxy S, continue to gain share. *Samsung Device Sitting Pretty at Number 2 Spot: Apple device share remains relatively flat year-over-year, but continues to hold strong at the number 1 spot. Samsung share, on the other hand, has leapt 5 percentage points over the previous year, which strengthens its number 2 positioning. Blackberry and HTC face the most challenging struggle, with HTCs global market share dropping to 5.3 percent in the first quarter from 9.3 percent a year earlier according to analyst firm Gartner. *Apps Continue to Dominate the Mobile World: According to ad requests on the Jumptap platform, 84 percent of mobile traffic now comes from apps. Just two years ago, the split was roughly 50/50. At the time, some experts predicted the death of the mobile app as companies began to build responsive, cross-platform mobile sites. It now seems that reports of the death of apps were greatly exaggerated. *Feature Phone Users Tend to Be Southern, Older: According to Gartner, smartphones finally outsold feature phones worldwide. Yet with an abundance of non-smartphones still in existence, who are these feature phone-wielding consumers? Data from comScore and the Jumptap platform show feature phone users over-index as being concentrated in the South, older, lower in income, and/or likely to be customers of T-Mobile or Cricket.

Sony Corp.  will start selling the PlayStation 4 in North America on Nov. 15, moving to obtain an early advantage in the largest video-game market against Microsoft Corp. The $399 player, Sonys first new console in seven years, will be available in Europe on Nov. 29 and in 32 countries for the Christmas holiday season, Sony Computer Entertainment Chief Executive Officer Andrew House said yesterday in Cologne, Germany, ahead of the annual Gamescom, Europes biggest game conference. Orders already top 1 million, he said. Sonys plans put the PlayStation 4 in more than double the markets of Microsofts $499 Xbox One as the two companies begin a multiyear battle for dominance. Microsoft , which initially targeted 21 countries for its debut, last week cut the number to 13 to ensure larger markets have sufficient supplies. Sonys pricing is aggressive, said Koki Shiraishi, a Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities. Sony has a better chance against its rival because its setting the console price lower. Sony gained 0.5 percent to 1,937 yen in Tokyo trading today and has doubled so far this year. Smartphone Games The new consoles from Sony and Microsoft enter a marketplace that has shifted since the last influx toward mobile games played on tablets and smartphones like Apple Inc. s iPhone. Console makers are betting faster machines with new features, from motion capture to immersive graphics, will entice consumers to spend on hardware as well as games. The introduction of new consoles is likely to spark consumer appetite and set the video-game market up for a new growth cycle, according to a note from Richard Beaudoux, a Paris-based analyst at Natixis Securities. Sonys set is cheaper than Xbox, so it will be easier to purchase, said Junya Ayada, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Co. in Tokyo. The PS4 is said to have gathered over 1 million pre-orders, but the key question is how much will it sell after the launch. Sony will discuss its Japan release plans at a Sept. 9 press conference. The company unveiled the PlayStation 4 in June at E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo. To counter the mobile threat, Tokyo-based Sony is tying the console to its Vita handheld player. Executives yesterday showed off games for 90 minutes to highlight the robust lineup of available titles, demonstrated how users will be able to use Wi-Fi within the home to play games streamed from the PlayStation 4 and announced a price cut for the Vita. Price Cut The Vitas price was lowered to $199 from $250, Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, said at the event. In Europe, the new price is 199 euros . Ryan also said the company has forged partnerships in Europe with Deutsche Telekom AG , Orange SA , Virgin Media and Ono to sell fast Internet service with graphics power tailored for video-game players. House also took a dig at Microsoft, which faced a customer backlash over policies that would have restricted the ability to buy, sell and trade used games for the Xbox One, as well as requiring a connection to the Internet. The Xbox One also may be played without using the Kinect motion-sensing controller, which allows for voice commands, and can identify users. The device is included in the sale price and initially was going to be required to turn on the console. Message Shifted While others have shifted their message and changed their story, we were consistent in maintaining policies that were fair and in tune with consumer desires, House said. Microsoft unveiled its Xbox One console in May. The company hasnt specified a release date. Sony probably wont gain a strong advantage over Microsoft because the Xbox One is likely to go on sale in all of its announced territories Nov. 22, said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. That means the PlayStation 4 will only be available in the U.S., the largest market, for one week ahead of its rival, and be behind it elsewhere. Nintendo Co. began selling its most recent console, the Wii U, in November. It sold 160,000 units of the player in the three months ended in June, pushing the total to 3.6 million since its debut in November. In April, the company forecast sales of 9 million in the year ending next March. Gamescom, due to host more than 275,000 attendees this year according to its organizers, runs from Aug. 21 to Aug. 25.

"content": "//'); //]]> You need to enable Javascript to play media on Bloomberg.com Play // Gross, Dudley, Mishkin's Own Words on Fed's Yellen Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve vice chairman has spent time building relationships across the Feds regional banks and with central bankers from Shanghai to London to Mexico City -- everywhere except the corridors of power in Washington. Yellens calendars, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show more than 90 meetings by phone or in person with Fed district bank presidents in 2011 and 2012, a period during which she made visits to the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco. By contrast, she visited the White House once and Capitol Hill twice. Supporters of Yellen, 67, are seeking to keep her in contention along with Lawrence Summers to succeed Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. Summers, a former Treasury secretary and White House economic adviser, has regular contacts with White House officials and in recent months has been in touch with senators who will vote on the Fed nominee. Almost every political adviser you see in the White House organization chart has had some experience with Larry Summers, said Vincent Reinhart, a former top adviser to Bernanke and Alan Greenspan and now the chief U.S. economist for Morgan Stanley. Thats not true for Janet Yellen. When the Federal Open Market Committee gathers in Washington for monetary policy decisions, Yellen often has breakfast with one district bank president, then sits down with another, before the meeting starts in the morning. That familiarity with her colleagues would likely make her an adept manager of the central bank, said Robert Eisenbeis, a former Atlanta Fed research director. Fed Culture Shes steeped in the culture, said Eisenbeis, now chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida. Nobody understands the culture from the many perspectives that shes had. While Yellen has spent her years in Washington deepening her ties to the Feds regional presidents, she has devoted comparatively little time to building political relationships. In 2011 and 2012 her calendar shows meetings with only two members of Congress -- Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican on the Banking Committee, and Representative Dave Schweikert, a Republican from Arizona, according to her calendars, which run through January of 2013. Yellen declined to comment. Given that shes currently vice chair of the Fed, she would have to be very careful in her interactions with Congress and the White House, said Michael Hanson, a former Fed economist who is now senior U.S. economist for Bank of America Corp. in New York. The Fed is adamant about protecting its independence these days. Senators Letter That hasnt kept many senators from getting to know and admire Yellen through speeches in which she advocates focusing on reducing unemployment. One-third of the 54-member Senate Democratic caucus signed a letter praising Yellen and recommending President Barack Obama pick her to succeed Bernanke. While the letter mentions no other candidates by name, it was circulated after Summers, 58, emerged as a contender. By identifying all the reasons he should go for Yellen it implicitly undercuts support for Summers, said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who studies the relationship between the Fed and Congress. The letter made a point by not making a point. The letter may do little to dissuade Obama, Binder said. It seems that shes not in the orbit of what the White House is looking for. Tennis Partners Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council at the beginning of Obamas presidency, was also a tennis partner of the president and other top economic advisers. His White House ties were forged when Summers provided the analysis that led to the successful bailout of automaker Chrysler Group LLC, now majority-owned by Fiat SpA. Summers led daily economic briefings in the Oval Office and was the person Obama turned to for updates on a range of issues in the financial crisis, including the auto bailouts, the $830 billion economic stimulus package, housing and financial regulation. Secret Service visitor logs show Summers had at least 10 meetings at the White House since leaving the administration at the end of 2010. At least four of the meetings listed were with the president in the Oval Office. Yellen has been to the White House only once in the two years through January, according to White House visitor logs and her calendar. In November 2011 she joined Bernanke and Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Alan Krueger for lunch at the White House mess. Monthly Luncheon In January of 2012 she began attending a monthly luncheon with the Council of Economic Advisers. Otherwise, her calendar shows little contact with officials close to the president: a goodbye reception for Austan Goolsbee when he left CEA in 2011 and two meetings with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Krueger, Goolsbee and Geithner have all since left the administration. Yellen is more familiar to many policy makers overseas. During her stint as Fed vice chairman she maintained a busy international travel schedule, flying to meetings of regulators and central bankers in London, Paris, Zurich, Basel, Bern, Helsinki, Mexico City, Tokyo and Shanghai. I have known Janet for some years, South African Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus said in Johannesburg on Aug. 13. When Janet talks, you can hear a pin drop. She is methodical, analytical. And there is absolutely no reason she shouldnt be considered. Building Consensus As Fed vice chairman, Yellens attentiveness to the district Fed presidents proved invaluable in building consensus on policy issues. She took control of a subcommittee focused on the Feds communication challenges. For years, policy makers on the FOMC had been unable to agree to holding press conferences or spelling out goals for inflation and unemployment. Yellens subcommittee met almost as often as the FOMC -- 15 times in person and via telephone in 2011 and 2012 -- according to her calendars. The meetings culminated in a breakthrough in policy: A January 2012 statement that committed the central bank to achieving inflation of 2 percent in the longer term and spelled out a goal of 5.2 percent to 6 percent for the unemployment rate. The Feds regional presidents, eight of whom hold Ph.D. degrees in economics, agreed unanimously to adopt the statement. Internal Disagreement It was a vindication of Yellens stance in almost 20 years of internal disagreement over the Feds longer-run goals. In January 1995, then-Fed chairman Greenspan arranged a debate between Yellen and Richmond Fed President Al Broaddus, with Broaddus arguing that the Fed should announce an explicit inflation target, while Yellen advocated an approach that considers both sides -- stable prices and maximum employment -- of the dual mandate. Even during her early days at the Fed, Yellen was the most effective participant at the FOMC table, said Robert Parry, her predecessor as president of the San Francisco Fed, who served on the FOMC when Yellen was a Fed governor from 1994 to 1997. There was no one that I think made comments that were more helpful than her, Parry said. Every time she made a presentation, she really made me think. Sometimes I had different views on the issues, but I always appreciated her perspective. Berkeley Professor Her ability to persuade academics was honed at the University of California-Berkeley, where she was a professor from 1980 to 1994 before moving to Washington to serve as a Fed governor, and again from 1999 to 2004 before becoming president of the San Francisco Fed. She has a very low-key, insistent way of doing things, which is really important as a Fed chair, because theres a huge divergence of views, said Andrew Rose, a professor at Berkeley since 1986. Youve got to get unanimity of purpose. Mary C. Daly, senior vice president at the San Francisco Fed, said Yellen asked questions underscoring the human element of a problem. She didnt just come in and say, I would like to know if you think were likely to have a jobless recovery, said Daly, who has worked as an economist at the district bank since 1996. What she would say is, Millions of people have lost their jobs. To what extent do you think those millions of people cant come back to the labor market? What are they going to do for a living? How are they going to support themselves? That inspires people to dig deeply into research. Most Experienced Broaddus, whom Yellen debated in the 1990s, said she is the most experienced candidate he can imagine for the job. Shes very smart, shes been a governor, president of the San Francisco Fed, vice chair, said Broaddus. She could still be at Berkeley and shed be prominent. Yellens subcommittee work was able to unite two presidents with almost polar opposite views to support the same inflation and unemployment goals: Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, among the most vocal advocates for additional easing from the Fed, and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, one of the most unyielding internal opponents of Fed stimulus. Her record for consensus isnt perfect. Governor Daniel Tarullo, Obamas first appointment to the Fed board and the official who has led the central banks regulatory efforts, refused to go along with Yellen. When the FOMC voted to adopt the statement of goals in January 2012, Tarullo abstained because he questioned the ultimate usefulness of the statement. In January 2013 he abstained from a decision to renew the statement. Consensus Forecast Yellens panel also worked from at least June of 2012 to January of 2013 at an attempt to develop a consensus forecast that would provide a better baseline of how the FOMC would react to incoming economic data. The effort foundered as the views of FOMC members proved too diverse to encapsulate in a single forecast. Her stature among her colleagues has grown over the years, New York Fed President William C. Dudley said in a May interview with Bloomberg Television. I have tremendous respect for her ability. She is bright. She is tough. She is determined. Shes brave. These are all the qualities that I think a Fed chairman should have. In the end, though, that may not be what matters most. There are enough people who will vouch for Janet Yellen, Reinhart said. The problem is theyre not in the inner circle.

"author": "Cordell Eddings", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "The governments $16 billion sale of five-year inflation-linked notes sold at the highest yield since 2010 amid bets that the economic recovery is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to begin withdrawing monetary stimulus. The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities yielded negative 0.127 percent, highest yield since April, 2010, with investors wary of paying a premium to guard against the threat of rising consumer prices. The last sale, an $18 billion offering on April 18, drew a yield of negative 1.311 percent, the second-lowest on record, after the securities sold at a record negative 1.496 percent in December 2012. The front end of the TIPS curve is not an area where people are super excited about after the backup in rates weve seen, said George Goncalves, the head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of the 21 primary dealers obligated to bid at government auctions. Investors are even less worried about inflation as we get closer to tapering, because there will be less money in the system. Holders of TIPS receive an adjustment to the principal value of their securities equal to the change in the consumer price index, in addition to a fixed rate of interest thats smaller than the interest paid to a holder of conventional debt. Difficult Times The TIPS sale had a 2.18 bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand that compares the amount bid with the amount offered, matching the demand at the previous auction this April, which was the weakest since October 2008. The average at the previous 10 sales was 2.77. There are still difficult times ahead for TIPS, as there is caution from investors in reengaging the market fully after the big selloff weve seen, said Carlos Pro, an interest-rate strategist at primary dealer Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. There is challenging outlook for inflation, with disinflation still a risk in the U.S. And that backdrop combines with the likely September taper from the Fed. TIPS maturing in three to five years have lost 3.6 percent this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes. TIPS of all maturities have lost 9.4 percent in 2013, on pace for the worst loss since they were first sold in 1997. The broader Treasury market has fallen 3.8 percent, Merrill Lynch data show. Fed Buying Inflation expectations have plummeted this year as investors begin to price in an end to the Feds $85 billion monthly bond-buying program that has swelled the Feds balance sheet to a record $3.65 trillion. Minutes of the Feds last policy meeting released yesterday showed officials are comfortable with a plan to start reducing bond buying later this year if the economy improves. The central bank will start tapering in September and end purchases in mid-2014, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 48 economists conducted Aug. 9-13. The Federal Open Market Committee holds its next meeting on Sept. 17-18. The difference in yield between five-year notes and similar-maturity TIPS, a measure of trader expectations for inflation over the life of the debt, called the break-even rate, has fallen to 1.76 percentage points, down from a high for the year of 2.42 percentage points in March. The measure has averaged 2.07 percent over the past year. The U.S. consumer-price index increased 0.2 percent in July after a 0.5 percent gain in June, according to Labor Department figures. The advance matched the median forecast of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Bidder Participation Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes foreign central banks, purchased 38.2 percent of the securities. The average for the previous 10 offerings was 41.1 percent. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 8.1 percent of the securities. The average at the past 10 sales was 8.9 percent. Investors bid $2.89 for each dollar of the $1.345 trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. Thats down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last years offerings.

Icahn, who invested around $1 billion in Apple, has said he wants the iPhone maker to increase its buyback program to boost the share price. The payout for shareholders that Icahn is seeking would be an increase from the $100 billion plan that Apple has under way and expects to complete by 2015. Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, didnt immediately return a call seeking comment. Icahn projects Apples stock can rise to more than $625 if it buys back shares, a person familiar with his thinking said earlier this month. Icahn wants Apple to borrow $150 billion at a 3 percent interest rate to fund the purchases and avoid paying more taxes, the person added.

"author": "Bloomberg News", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "Apple Inc. s share of the Chinese tablet-computer market plunged in the second quarter as Samsung Electronics Co.  and dozens of local makers built on gains in smartphones to curb growth in iPad shipments. Apple accounted for 28 percent of tablet shipments during the period, down from 49 percent a year earlier, Dickie Chang, a Hong Kong-based analyst with researcher IDC, said in an e-mail today. Samsung surged to second with 11 percent, while half of shipments were generated by producers with 1 percent or less each in market share, he said. Consumers in China, Apples largest market outside the U.S., are turning to cheaper tablets using Google Inc. s Android operating system, following a trend in smartphones that saw the iPhones market share almost halve. Local brands including Ramos and Teclast are joining Samsung and Lenovo Group Ltd.  in capturing sales once dominated by the iPad. Apple has lost its luster in China in the past six months and is no longer the must-have product in any category, said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. Consumers are more price-sensitive. Before, people would skip lunch to buy an iPad. Carolyn Wu, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment on the IDC data. Beijing-based Lenovo was third in the tablet market with 8 percent, down from 9 percent a year earlier, Chang said. Acer Inc.  and Asustek Computer Inc. , both based in Taipei, each had 1 percent share, he said. Huawei, ZTE Other vendors among the top 10 with about 1 percent each include Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp. , and Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. , both of which are based in the southern China city of Shenzhen. While Apples China tablet shipments in the period increased 28 percent to 1.48 million units, Samsungs rose more than fourfold to 571,000 and Lenovos doubled to 413,000, Chang said. Much of Apples lost market share went to small Chinese companies, according to IDCs Chang. Tablet makers with 1 percent market share or less collectively accounted for 50 percent of shipments in the second quarter, compared with 36 percent a year earlier, Chang said. Those local players include brands Onda and Aigo, and producers who sell unbranded products to others, Chang said. They are able to leverage the same supply chain in Shenzhen that produces components for many name-brand tablets and then copy the business model that allowed hundreds of makers of smartphones to flourish in China, he said. Fragmented Market The tablet market is fragmented with many local/whitebox players, Chang wrote in an e-mail. Many Chinese vendors get a piece as the entry barrier is not high enough. The domestic vendors also are capitalizing on a lack of new products from Apple, as a new iPad or iPhone hasnt been introduced since last year. Apples smartphone shipments in China fell to 5 percent of the total in the second quarter from 9 percent a year earlier, market researcher Canalys said Aug. 9. That is Apples lowest market share since the fourth quarter of 2010, according to estimates from Canalys. Samsung held the top spot with 18 percent share. Apple is set to unveil new devices later this year, and that wait is providing an opportunity for local makers, said Wang Jun, a Beijing-based analyst with researcher Analysys International. If Apple cant release an innovative tablet soon, then Android will dominate the market, he said. Android has quickly seized the tablet PC market with a crushing force, Wang said in an e-mail. Chinese brands are hot on the online selling channels and have earned more market share with low prices and high product value.

Vevo, which is owned by major music labels including Sony Corp.s Sony Music Entertainment, will introduce an application on the Apple TV box in the coming weeks that will feature on-demand music videos as well as other programming, said the people, who asked not to be named because the deal hasnt been made public. Apple is speeding up the pace of adding new content to its set-top box. The Cupertino, California-based company announced new programming deals with Time Warner Inc.s HBO and Walt Disney Co. s ESPN in June, and is also in talks to add an app available with live broadcasting for subscribers of Time Warner Cable Inc. , people familiar with the plans have said. Programming from iTunes, Netflix Inc.  and Hulu LLC has long been available on Apple TV, which was unveiled in 2007. Vevo will also be available through Samsung Electronics Co. televisions, said one of the people familiar with the plans. AdAge and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the Apple-Vevo deal, and The Wall Street Journal said yesterday that Vevo will be available through Samsung televisions. Jennifer Press, a spokeswoman for Vevo, declined to comment. Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple, and Adam Yates, a spokesman for Samsung, didnt respond to requests for comment. For Vevo, making its music videos available on TV sets is a way to expand beyond YouTube, the Google Inc.  online video service. Google and Vevo have been partners since 2009, when Vevo began as a new way for record labels to make money from the popularity of watching music videos online. Under that arrangement, Vevo shares advertising revenue with YouTube when its videos are shown through the Google service.

"title": "Barnes & Noble Ends Breakup Push for Now for Nook Revival - Bloomberg", 
"author": "Matt Townsend", 
"source": "businessinsider", 
"content": "Barnes & Noble Inc. s move to shelve a breakup plan for now steps up pressure on the biggest U.S. bookstore chain to stem losses at its e-book division and hatch a new plan for coping with the shift toward digital publications. They are stuck, said Michael Souers, an analyst for Standard & Poors in New York. While the company could become profitable by shedding the Nook business, e-books will continue to take market share from printed books. Founder Leonard Riggio, 72, who is also the chains chairman and largest shareholder, said yesterday in a filing that he dropped the plan he floated in February to buy Barnes & Nobles website and almost 680 stores. The shares plunged, erasing their gain for the year, as the company also reported a fiscal first-quarter loss that was bigger than analysts estimated. Sales at the Nook unit, once the centerpiece of a plan for navigating from printed to digital books, declined 20 percent in a third straight drop. Rather than banking on a breakup, Barnes & Noble now will focus on better integrating its retail, college and Nook units, President Michael Huseby said in an interview. The company may revisit breakup prospects in the future, he said. The stock fell 0.8 percent to $14.49 at the close in New York. The shares have slid 4 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent increase for the Standard & Poors 500 Index. A further decline in the price eventually may bring back Riggio or convince a private-equity fund to make a bid, said Souers, who rates the companys shares a hold. CEO Exit Barnes & Noble created Nook Media, a subsidiary made up of its Nook digital reading and college bookstore divisions, last year with the goal of spinning it off. The impetus for that was the company said investors werent properly valuing the Nooks success. That thesis collapsed during the holidays when new devices flopped, forcing writedowns and eventually led to the July departure of Chief Executive Officer William Lynch, who oversaw Nook. Huseby declined to provide details about the companys revised plan other than promoting products across channels and sharing costs. Hes the companys highest-ranking executive since Lynchs departure. The Nook divisions costs in the quarter ended July 27 produced a loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $55 million, following a deficit of $57 million by the same measure in the previous year. Reversed Decision Since starting Nook in 2009, Barnes & Noble has been taking the profits from its stores and spending on building a digital unit to compete on content and devices with Amazon.com Inc.  The division has also sought outside investors. Microsoft Corp. and Pearson Plc  invested in the Nook Media unit last year. Pearsons 5 percent stake in December, which came after Microsoft announced about an 18 percent purchase in April, valued the subsidiary at $1.79 billion. The market valuation for all of Barnes & Noble was just $872 million at yesterdays close. Their investments came after Liberty Media Corp.  took a stake in the entire company in August 2011. Liberty initially made a cash offer of $17 a share, or about $1 billion, in May and then three months later spent $204 million buying preferred shares that can be converted into a 17 percent stake. Microsoft, Liberty Media Microsoft and Liberty Media need to figure out their strategies, said John Tinker, an analyst with Maxim Group in New York, who recommends buying the shares. After Nook tablets missed with consumers during the holidays, Lynch said the company would look for a major hardware manufacturing partner to help produce those devices to reduce costs and the risk of making them on its own. Yesterday the company reversed that decision. Huseby said that Barnes & Noble would continue to design and develop color devices along with its black-and-white e-readers under the Nook brand and that it wont be outsourcing production. If we want to be in the content business, we need to be in the device business, and we believe our people can develop devices better than anyone else, Huseby said on a call with analysts to discuss the quarterly results. While Nook tablets were well reviewed, the company didnt sell as many as it expected. Lynch had chalked that up to other devices having more functionality, and in May, Barnes & Noble reached an agreement with Google Inc. to install several of its applications on Nooks. Amazon, Apple Barnes & Noble has rejected that notion too, as Huseby said it will no longer try compete head-to-head with the likes of Amazon and Apple Inc.  It will instead make devices geared to its core customers of readers and learners. He even declined to use the word tablet in describing Nooks next color devices because the term is too closely associated with Apples iPad. To use the word tablet is to put us into a league that we arent willing to go into at this point, Huseby said. Our focus is on providing the best reading experience. Were not trying to be all things to all people. The chain will release one new device for the holiday shopping season, after unveiling two tablets last year. As for concerns over the losses Nook continues to incur, Huseby said those would be reduced by being better at forecasting demand after missing by so much during the holidays. Quarterly Loss The net loss in the quarter was $87 million, or $1.56 a share, compared with a loss of $39.8 million, or 76 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said in a statement. The loss excluding some items was 86 cents. Analysts projected a loss of 67 cents, the average of six estimates. Sales declined 8.5 percent to $1.33 billion. Analysts projected $1.32 billion. Revenue at the chains 674 stores sank 10 percent. The results were reported just minutes after Riggio filed an update to his 13-D filing. While I reserve the right to pursue an offer in the future, I believe it is in the companys best interests to focus on the business at hand, Riggio said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Riggios decision is not surprising given that the Nook business has collapsed, said Tinker, the Maxim Group analyst. The issue here is you have a lot of deal investors in the stock and there is obviously no deal today. I emphasize today, Tinker said yesterday. The company didnt name a successor to Lynch and declined to comment on whether it was looking for a new CEO. After Lynch left the company, Huseby was promoted from chief financial officer to president of the company and CEO of Nook Media. He reports to Riggio. Riggio, who still owns about 30 percent of the booksellers stock, founded the company in 1965 with a college bookstore in Manhattan. Six years later, he bought the Barnes & Noble name and its flagship store, beginning a spree of acquisitions, including Doubleday Bookshops. The chain started focusing on superstores, instead of mall sites, in the 1990s.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, good afternoon to everybody, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 conference call. As you can tell from our press release this afternoon, our revenues totaled about $683 million, which was up about 1% from the previous quarter and down about 10% from the same quarter last year, and was just very slightly below our plan for the quarter, but well within the range that we communicated in May. Diluted earnings per share of $0.56 was at the midpoint of our earlier guidance. The good news is that despite economic headwinds and increasing uncertainty in most regions of the world, our business in aggregate remains stable during the quarter. Our bellwether industrial business which now comprises 47% of our revenues, was approximately flat to last quarter, remaining stable after growing very strongly in our Q2. Our largest industrial customers indicate to us that while their earlier growth expectations for 2012 have modulated in the past few months, they currently see very little deterioration in their business to date, and they don't expect any significant downturn for the balance of the year. Now these customers, the large industrial customers, were for the most part are on plan for the quarter. Our distribution channel, which primarily serves the industrial market, was consistent throughout the quarter and was stable in July. In fact in July, we saw stronger bookings on ADI from our distributors, indicating that while they too remain cautious, they don't foresee any deterioration in their business in the near term. These trends are very significant for ADI given the importance of the industrial market to our revenues and to our profits. Our communications infrastructure business grew 9% sequentially, driven by wireless customers that was in line with our expectations for new wireless base station deployments in the United States, in Asia and also in Japan. As I think you know, we're very well positioned with market-leading OEMs in Europe, in Asia and in the U.S. with a product portfolio that addresses both existing technology and also newer 4G deployments, which we will expect will increase ADI's content in those base stations. Automotive revenues decreased very slightly sequentially, but was up 12% over the same quarter last year. This was also slightly below our plan for the quarter as European manufacturers reduced production in the summer months in response to the uncertain economic environment and also lackluster car sales in Europe. Safety, including rollover control and radar-based collision avoidance systems, energy efficiency and infotainment all represent great growth opportunities for ADI, and we expect the automotive market to become increasingly attractive for us. Our consumer business was approximately flat sequentially, which was also slightly below our plan for the quarter. Growth in portable media offset declines in digital cameras, while other subsegments, such as home entertainment and also computing, remained approximately flat. The good news here is that our backlog for consumer products grew substantially during the quarter, which should provide good revenue growth for ADI in our fourth quarter. Order rates from our end customers remained solid during the third quarter and totaled approximately $700 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio that's greater than 1. We're generating an increasing amount of our sales from turns orders which are booked and shipped during the same quarter. This is typical in an uncertain environment and when our lead times continue to be very short. In aggregate, there did not appear to be a lot of market momentum in either a positive or negative direction. And in the short term, our revenues will be mostly dependent by the macro economy and to a lesser degree, new product cycles in certain end markets. In this environment, we believe we're doing a very credible job in responding to all the uncertainty. We continue to make trade-offs to focus our investments on the right products, the right markets and the right customers, to maximize our long-term growth rate. In general, our gross margins have remained very strong and our operating expenses are under very tight control, and we continue to generate significant operating cash flow, which gives us the flexibility to enhance returns to shareholders. And we would expect very strong operating leverage as macro conditions improve. So that's all I'm going to say in the opening comments. I'll turn it over to Dave now, who will take you through some of the details of our financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, third quarter revenue increased approximately 1% sequentially to $683 million. Our gross margin was 65.6% in the third quarter. This was up 40 basis points from the 65.2% we reported in the second quarter, driven by slightly higher utilization rates. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. Operating expenses for the third quarter, excluding approximately $5.8 million in restructuring-related expenses, were $230 million compared to about $228 million in the prior quarter. This slight dollar increase was primarily due to a full quarter's impact of the annual salary increases. We continue to be very watchful of operating expenses during this period of uncertainty and do not plan to grow expenses until we are confident that the economic headwinds have abated. Operating profits before tax for the third quarter, excluding restructuring related expenses, were $218 million or 32% of sales, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 19%, lower than the prior quarter's 23%. The lower rate was due to a change in estimates of our future tax liabilities and some discrete tax items. We expect our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 21% to 22% excluding any discrete tax item. Diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in the third quarter was at the midpoint of our guidance and up 6% sequentially from the prior quarter. We generated 20% of our revenue or $138 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $39 million, resulting in free cash flow of about $100 million or 14% of revenue for the quarter. While a strong result, third quarter operating cash was impacted by payments related to variable compensation and some income tax payments. Our expectations for the fourth quarter is for operating cash to be significantly stronger, in the range of its historical norms, upgraded in 30% of revenues. Our accounts receivable balance was up about $16 million versus the last quarter on higher sales, and our days sales outstanding remains roughly flat at 46 days. Inventory on our balance sheet increased by 3% or $8 million, and we have 121 days of inventory on hand. We have increased inventory to meet anticipated seasonal demand from our consumer customers in the second half of the calendar year, as well as to respond to a new product cycle. By the end of our fiscal first quarter of 2013, we expect the business to catch up to the inventory growth and as a result, days of inventory should be more in line with our model of 100 to 110 days. Inventory at distribution was approximately flat to last quarter and weeks of inventory and distribution remained flat at approximately 7.5 weeks, which is at the lower end of historical norms. During the third quarter, we repurchased $17 million of our stock. We also distributed approximately $90 million or 53% of net income in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash and short-term investments balance at the end of the third quarter was roughly flat to last quarter, with approximately $1 billion available domestically. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $857 million in debt outstanding. On August 20, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on September 12, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2012. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%. In addition, we have approximately $580 million remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program. We plan to continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock. Since the start of our share repurchase program in fiscal 2004, the company has repurchased approximately 129 million shares or $4.4 billion of company stock. In summary, third quarter delivered solid results during challenging times. Our operating model turned a 1% sequential increase in revenue into a 6% sequential increase in diluted earnings per share. At gross margins of 65.6% and operating margins of 32%, including any restructuring charges, we still have leverage ahead as sales increase, factory utilization improves and we continue to prudently control our operating expenses. And now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Thanks, Dave. Looking forward in the short term, we expect our industrial, communications and automotive businesses to remain stable in Q4 and be at similar revenue levels to Q3. In our consumer business, increased backlog and a strong product cycle lead us to plan for growth in Q4. In total, we expect our revenues to be in the range of $685 million to $715 million. We know, however, that our largest distributors have indicated a wide range of possible outcomes for their quarter ending in September, which reflects economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe. If our growth is mostly from consumer products in Q4 and reflecting what is now planned to be lower factory utilization, we'd expect our gross margins to be in the range of approximately 65%. We're planning for operating expenses to be roughly flat to last quarter. Based on these assumptions, we'd expect our diluted earnings in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.60. In the longer term, we remain enthusiastic for continuing very profitable growth and cash generation based on our better product mix, our customers' enthusiasm for working very closely with ADI to meet their toughest technical challenges and a highly competitive responses capability to meet whatever our customers ask us. In the long term, these attributes will determine our growth rate. But certainly in the short term, it will be mostly about the macro economy. Ali Husain Thank you, Jerry. Thank you, Dave. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we are now ready for questions from our participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Just the first one on gross margins, so you indicated obviously mix and lower utilizations as taking the margins down a little bit next quarter even on higher revenues. I know you said utilizations went up a little bit this quarter. Can you give me some feeling for exactly where they are this quarter? I think they were 70% last quarter. Where are they going next quarter? Are they dropping lower than they were, say, in Q2 when I think they were at 67%? And can you give us some feeling for additional margin drivers, I guess, as we go into the beginning of next fiscal 2013 on revenue levels that hopefully can begin to grow off of here? David A. Zinsner Utilization was a little bit north of 70% this quarter. And we're expecting it to be in the range of -- the quarter you cited, which was in the kind of high 60s for next quarter. And clearly, utilization will be one of the bigger factors in driving the gross margins up when we were running in the 80s, we had 67% gross margin. Some of that of course was due to mix but a fair amount of that was due to utilizations, so we'd expect as utilization does improve, our gross margins improve. Also we are in, I guess, a relatively tepid environment on the industrial side. We do expect over time, as the economy improves, that to pick up. That is our highest gross margin end market and should be accretive to gross margins as well. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. I think for us, Stacy, the encouraging thing is that even at these levels where we're forecasting a relatively strong consumer quarter relative to industrial and communications, and given the fact that utilization is -- we're going to keep pretty low to keep the inventories down, we can still run sort of 65-type gross margins is a lot different than it used to be, and a positive effect. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Helpful, guys. For my follow-up, a question on the common infrastructure space. So it was up this quarter, I think in line with your expectations. Lots of folks have been looking for the potential for bigger acceleration of that market in general into the back half of the year given some of the guidance that's out there right now for some of the carriers, but you seem to be guiding at flat. So it doesn't sound like -- it sounds like, I mean have we seen the list that we're going to see that in that market when we're done? Or do you think there's still the prospect for further growth next quarter maybe if we're going out another quarter to after that? Do you think that there's still opportunity for further growth in that market? Do you think that we're going to see pickups in carrier spend? And is this something -- are the current levels that we're seeing out there sustainable. Vincent T. Roche I think when you factor in the -- we have 2 components to our infrastructure business. We got the wireless component that's pretty dominant, about 2/3 of the overall revenue and in the infrastructure sector. And we've got a wired component as well. We've seen much stronger growth on the wireless side. And in spite of the fact that our customers have been suffering from the lack of CapEx spending by the operators, but there are signs that the operators are beginning to spend money, particularly in America and in Asia in the build-out of 3G networks. So I think there may be a little upside in the wireless space in the fourth quarter. And we're starting to see the deployment as well of the TD-LTE systems in China. So expect sometime in the second half of next year we'll see the lift from that. And we're also expecting the fast pace of the build-out of wireless networks in China in the traditional TD-SCDMA sector. So I think what -- we're in about 4Q, I think looking into the next fiscal year, I think we'll see some good upside, particularly in the wireless area. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Does that imply that the wired side of things is a bit of a headwind right now? Vincent T. Roche It's relatively flat. It's been flat for the last couple of quarters. And that business is comprised of enterprise networking, cable infrastructure, and it's been relatively muted over the last couple of quarters. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just a question on the consumer side of things. Could you give us a little more color on what's driving the upside beyond seasonality? And to the extent seasonality comes into that mix, how should we think about the duration of that business being up before it seasonally -- potentially rolls over? Jerald G. Fishman Well -- this is Jerry. The -- I think the way to think about it is we, a year or 2 ago, really tried to focus our consumer business on opportunities that were much more sustainable to customers who were willing to pay us a fair margin for. And we've reset that product line pretty substantially. So I think we have a good cycle coming up, we believe. And some of the newer products that we've done in the consumer space that we think really add new types of functionality to consumer products that we believe are going to be very valuable. So of course the consumer business always has its up and downs. And the fourth quarter is typically a good seasonal quarter for consumer products. First quarter tends to be somewhat weaker sometimes. But consumer products is still a relatively small part of our total sales. So I think that as we look over the next period out there, I think in the short term, our results will be much heavier, much more dependent on what happens in the macro economy to our industrial, our communications business. The consumer revenues will modulate with product cycles and buildups for seasonal purchases but I think in the next 3 to 6 months, it's going to be mostly about the macro stuff for us when you factor everything into it. And that is going to be much more relevant to our sales than any of these cycles. I think in the fourth quarter, we are going to get some lift from a couple of product launches in consumer but after that, I think it's going to be mostly dependent on the macro stuff. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Great. And one follow-up, I guess more for Dave on this one. You mentioned about holding OpEx pretty much flat until macro shows some better positive signs of life. As we look into early fiscal '13, in the January quarter, are there any sequential changes that we should be prepared for; FICO taxes, bonus merit, things like that, that pop that up even by a couple million dollars? David A. Zinsner No, not really. I mean we'll likely have some inflationary effect sometime next year but it's relatively modest, it adds 1% or 2% to the OpEx per year. Jerald G. Fishman I mean our take is for the levels that the business is operating at now and what we see in the near future, we got plenty of OpEx to grow in this business. And for us, it's mostly a question of focusing that OpEx on the right stuff. And so I think that's what Dave's comment is really based on. We got plenty of money we're spending, investing in the business. The real question is just make sure we put it in the right places. That's what we're working on. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division This is Parag for Uche. Just wanted to drill down further on your consumer business. Are you expecting any ramp in your MEMS microphone business? And is that what is driving the upside in the fourth quarter? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we have a good MEMS microphone. We expect the revenues in that to continue to grow. Vincent T. Roche Our consumer business again has 3 million components to it. And so we will see a lift in all 3 sectors, basically in the digital imaging, the portable space and home entertainment during the fourth quarter. So the consumer area is one of the spaces that uses every piece of technology and every type of product that we got, so it's actually quite diverse. And we'll see a general lift, I believe, in the fourth quarter, not dependent on any one product or area. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay, fair enough. And coming to the industrial business, you indicated that, that business is going to be flat. Just wanted to get a feel of whether this is a temporary pause or you think -- what is the level of visibility into this end market beyond the current quarter? Vincent T. Roche I think if you look at our business over the last couple of quarters in the industrial sector, we had a very sharp rebound of about 12% in the second quarter. We held onto that in the third quarter. From talking to customers all over the world I think, for the industrial sector, there's a lot of optimism about next year. But I think in the very, very short term, our customers are being very careful in terms of placing backlogs, building inventory. So I think there's a very good match currently between the consumption rates and the demand rates in ADI. And I don't see that change much, certainly during the next 3 or 4 months. Operator Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I guess if I could follow up a little bit on those last comments on the industrial segment, I believe you said the distribution channel actually increased orders in the month of July. So if I heard that right, did that continue into August? And is that at all unusual given the relatively tepid environment? Should we read anything into that, or is that just more a function of kind of lean supply chain at this point? Jerald G. Fishman Jim, I wouldn't read anything into that. The weekly distribution orders on us, patterns are fairly erratic. And they go up and down week to week. I think it was -- to us, it was more an indication rather than it's a long-term trend going on there that at least stop being eternal pessimist on this stuff. That at least they don't see their business eroding or they wouldn't be placing those kind of orders on us rather than us standing up and say that's the beginning of a trend. Vincent T. Roche I think you've got to look at the end customer bookings patterns. I think if you look over the last 6 months, that's bookings in the OEM and disti sectors at the end-customer level, what you'll see is a tremendous consistency over that 12 months in every region and across the industrial sector. So I think there's just, as Jerry said early on, there's no events in one way or the other. It's just didn't -- very, very stable. Jerald G. Fishman I mean the real challenge for us has been in trying to plan and manage Analog. The industrial business, which is a large part of our business, you read all the stories how the world is going to come apart and you get worried about that. So the very positive thing that we took out of really pouring through all the customers and all the geographies, as Vince was saying, is that it's very stable. And I think in this world right now, stability is a good thing. And we didn't see anything in the numbers either through the end of last quarter or the first couple of weeks of this quarter that indicate anything other than stability. And like I said in this world right now, stability is a good thing, right? I would reiterate I'd be cautious about trying to say, interpret that comment about July, the increased orders is the beginning of a trend. I hope it is, but I'm not jumping on that one yet. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And if I could ask my follow-up, Dave, just relative to the gross margins, if you get gross margins back to sort of the more peak levels, is that -- how much of that is going to be mix-dependent versus utilization-dependent? Is one or the other of those more critical to getting the margins back to the peak level? David A. Zinsner Both would be helpful. Clearly utilization would be a bigger component of the, I think, driver of the gross margin. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And is there an aggregate, a certain number of increase in basis points in utilization that's going to drive a certain number of gross margin improvement? David A. Zinsner I wouldn't say we have any kind of specific targets. But like I said, utilization was up a little bit north of 80% when our gross margins were kind of running in the 67%. I mean so that's probably a reasonable rule of thumb. Jerald G. Fishman And probably if it goes up, the mix will be relatively consistent. So that's probably -- so you can write, do an algorithm for that. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, you had mentioned that distributors are signaling a wide range of possible outcomes here at the end of the year. And I'm wondering is that from a particular geography? Or does that relate to a particular set of end markets? Can you give us some more color there? Jerald G. Fishman Our distributors came to focus more on the industrial market. And our overall distribution business is very U.S. and Europe-centric, and the main stream of distribution. So I think it's related to that. And there's 2 big distributors that we use. And I think if you just briefly read the commentary there, saying, \"You know things look okay, things look stable.\" But at the margin, they're packing a little more a parachute on the range of possibilities for next quarter, which is not surprising given all the uncertainty out there. But certainly, it's hard for us to get -- be more certain of the guidance when they're not very certain of their guidance. And they're not an insignificant portion of our business. But again, I think you can look at it 2 different ways. One sense, you say that sounds very uncertain. On the other hand, even the range of guidance they put out indicates that they think business is stable. So we tend to focus on that commentary as much as the precise numbers they are putting out. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay, that's helpful. And then switching gears to the automotive end market. It looks like we're taking a breather here after what was a really strong trailing 4 quarters. How should we think about automotives potential to reaccelerate over the next couple quarters? And how big can automotive become as a percent of mix in the next couple of years? Vincent T. Roche Yes. Well automotive is currently about 17% of the company's revenue. It's grown at double digits for multiple years here, and then we'll do it -- that again this year. What we've seen in the last couple of quarters, I think, is really related to the European market and European car manufacturers. So we've seen the manufacturing output reduced in Europe due to the economic uncertainty. And I think as well the lackluster performance we've seen in Europe has been offset to some extent by strength in other areas, such as Asia where we're beginning to see some good momentum build for the company finally, so in Japan, as well as the China and Korea. So I think our momentum bodes very, very well. And that's coupled with the recovery that is likely to happen in Europe. I think -- I hope that even next year, we should do quite well. Also, the new product pipeline and the design pipeline that we have would lead us to believe that the kind of growth we've been seeing in the 12%-plus area per year, we can keep that momentum going. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division And what is the geographic mix of the automotive business across Asia, U.S. and Europe? Vincent T. Roche Off the top of my head, it's probably -- U.S. and Europe combined are probably 70%, 75%, and the rest is Asia. Jerald G. Fishman I mean I think the trend that we can rely on is what Vince was saying is that direct product content growth is going up. There's an awful lot of analog and mixed signal content and all the sensors, all the engine controls, all the battery, monitoring, all the communications links, all the safety features, cars are going to have rollover control pretty soon legislated that consumes a lot of gyros. So I think that there's a lot of macro trends in the automotive market that really will help us accelerate our sales. That will be to some degree at least to our close approximation, much more relevant than how many more cars get sold this year or next, which doesn't change all that much. So I think the macro trends in the automotive market and the positions that we're continuing to build with the largest suppliers to the automotive market here in Europe, in Japan recently and in Korea recently are such that I think we'll do very well, if those trends continue. Operator Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee &amp; Leach. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division A couple of questions. One if you look at the distributor side, what are the inventory levels on the distributor side? And the industrial, when you look at the different segments within industrial, where do you see strength and where do you see kind of weakness or kind of limited visibility in those -- in that market? David A. Zinsner So I'll answer the first. I think Vince will answer the second. Inventory was on an absolute dollar basis slightly down and on days of inventory -- weeks of inventory is what we typically measure that, it was about 7.5 weeks, which is consistent with what it was last quarter. Vincent T. Roche Okay. And on the industrial sector, the area where we saw most weakness was the energy sector, both metrology as well as the transmission distribution part of that. We expected some rebound in the -- at the industrial automation area, it didn't happen. So most of the other subset of industrial were relatively flat for the quarter, 1 or 2 a little up, but energy down. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division Got it. And just making out a little bit to the last question there. When you look at the January quarter, any thoughts on what seasonality typically is? And are you seeing anything out of the ordinary in terms of trends as you look out? Jerald G. Fishman I mean not at this point in time. I mean we're trying to get through the fourth quarter right now, and then we'll give you an update on what we think about the fourth -- the first quarter when we get through this quarter. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division First one is on OpEx growth, and I'm trying to think how to conceptually model it going forward. So let's assume your sales growth 10% next year. With that kind of sales growth, how should we think about OpEx growth? David A. Zinsner Well, I mean we don't have an exact target. I would tell you that in the near term, given a lot of the uncertainty that exists, we're trying to keep it relatively flat with where we're spending today. If the business begins to recover, we'll look -- likely grow expenses, but we're trying to keep it at a rate that's significantly below whatever the revenue growth rate is. So our goal is -- from the 32% operating margins that we operate today on a non-GAAP basis, our goal, if we start to see some recovery, is to see the operating margins begin to expand. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Got it. And next one on the wireless infrastructure business, I believe you mentioned good growth opportunities there. How much does 4G or LTE contribute to that? And how much content expansion can you have as the mix shifts more towards LTE deployments? Vincent T. Roche The lion's share of our business today is 3G. At the present time, 4G is just rolling out. It's less -- it's quite a bit less than 10% of our wireless revenue, but it will become a very significant contributor over the next couple of years. So I think what you'll see is our business today is composed of 2G, 3G and now 4G. But I think in the next couple of years, you'll see a predominance of 3G. I think we'll still be 3G dominated for the next 2, 3 years. But LTE will become a significant part. I can only expect that it could be 20%, 30% of our revenue in that area in the next 2, 3 years. Jerald G. Fishman Certainly that's the fastest-growing parts of our wireless business right now, so it all depends on just how that grows relative to the more traditional 3G stuff. Vincent T. Roche The good news is we have a lot of content with more content specifically in a 4G system than we have in a 3G system, and all of these regular subsets are become enormously complex. And of course there's a lot of -- each one's got to handle the legacies as well. So the complexity of the silicon we're delivering increases generation by generation, and that will handle more frequencies, more bandwidth, more economic range. So the bottom value is increasing as well persistent. So as these 4G systems build out, we're very optimistic about our revenue growth potential there. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Is there any way to size that expansion? Is it 10% more, 15% more, 20% more as you grow from 3G to 4G? Vincent T. Roche More than 20%. Operator Our next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie Research. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research A lot of my questions have been answered already. But I was wondering if I could ask some more on the content growth story. You've highlighted the wireless segment and you've tried to quantify that. I was wondering if you could quantify some of the other areas that are non-automotive related in terms of content growth and maybe specifically, call out like industrial control systems or military equipment or other areas where you're also seeing a generation-to-generation content growth story. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Energy has been a good growth story for the company in the industrial sector over the past 5 years. And it's not a very big part of ADI's business. But the growth has been good, and it's a great long-term bet for the company. We see parts of the industrial automation sector, particularly in Asia we've done a good job, I think, connecting with our customers and the key applications there in the Asia region, so that would be a very good contributor for the company. In the wired infrastructure area, we've been investing heavily in building a portfolio in the observation control area, in areas like timing clock controls, timing generation clock controls. And these controllers, we have a dominant position in the controller circuits that monitor optical systems and cable infrastructure systems. So they are just a couple of spaces. Automotive of course, we've good position in powertrain, in infotainment, as well as safety. And all of those sectors are growing at a fast clip for the company. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Now is this -- I'm sorry to interrupt. I was going to ask is this a case of the complexity of your devices is growing as is your price in the system? Or is this your shipping more units into a box and displacing other kinds of devices? Or what's the dynamic happening within the box itself? Vincent T. Roche There's a little bit new -- I mean there's a lot of new features we have. As you know car companies are largely selling their cars in the basis of electronics technologies today. So there's a lot of new features that we're being asked to address. So again, I think the way to look at it is the complexity of the circuits and the products that we're shipping generation to generation is increasing and allowing us to increase our form value generation on generation there. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up, and I'll go away. The consumer business is going to be up double digits based on the math you kind of laid out for us, which would be a seasonal increase. I'm just trying to come to grips on what seasonal build versus some of the new product cycles you've highlighted. Can you specifically call out how the product cycle aspect of it, the new business you're getting is affecting your outlook for Q4? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it's really both. It's very challenging to try to give you a breakout of that and say half of that or 1/3 or whatever. I think the only takeaway is we're going to get some lift in the fourth quarter. We think we have a good product cycle. It's a seasonally strong quarter for us, and we'll wait and see what happens after that. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division With regard to your exposure on the wireline, you mentioned a little content on the optical systems, just wondering if you could talk about, is that more centered around like 40 or 100G? Or is that more like passive optical network-type systems? And to the extent that you're in the PON systems, is that you're seeing any pickup in the China build-outs? Vincent T. Roche Most of our business in the wired infrastructure area is not particularly in the data path, were -- it's mainly observation control, timing -- timing generation control, some data path solutions. I think it's true to say that in the optical subsystem area, we've seen -- I think over last 4 quarters, we've seen just a stable -- no growth, stable pattern, same thing as in the cable infrastructure market. And I think we certainly are playing in the China area. We've seen a little growth in China. I think which is then offset by some decline in America, largely due to ASP side. Jerald G. Fishman I think if you look at longer term in the wireline communications market, I think the real opportunity for ADI is going to wind up being integration of a lot of stuff we do. And we have a lot of the -- as Vince was saying, a lot of the stuff we do now is pinpoint products that are relatively standard products for that market. But I think increasingly as we get a much better insight into what our customers really need and want, there's an opportunity to take multiple technologies and integrate them for many of those customers. So I think that's where the breakout opportunity in that business for us exists. If it's just selling basically catalog products to customers that might be picked out for a particular usage, I think it's -- there is an opportunity. It's not huge growth opportunity. I think if we could accomplish some of the things that we're setting out to do now in terms of the level of integration that we could accomplish for those kind of customers, I think that's where we get an inflection point to the growth rate in that market. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Great. And just for my follow-up, you talked a number of times here about the new products in the consumer market. Can you give us a little more detail about what's changed or what specifically you've done that's new, what innovations you have made that's allowing you to get this big bump? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think we have a lot of different applications in the consumer market. We saw products that are in the audio signal chain, which are real important to a lot of customers, given that audio is a more important application than it's ever been in a lot of consumer products. We do a lot of video in the consumer area. We have products that range from relatively simple pinpoint products to highly integrated products that go into these applications. We sell MEMS products into consumer applications. So it's really a mixture of a lot of different things that go into our consumer business. The real challenge in the consumer business for all of us, I think, is developing or having products and customer relationships that last a long time from generation to generation and that turn out to differentiate our customers' products so that we can earn a fair return on them. And that's where we're focusing our effort. We're seeing some benefit of that focus coming up. Vincent T. Roche Given the life cycles of most of the systems onto which we ship in the consumer segment, virtually everything we do is a new product. Jerald G. Fishman That's both a good news and a bad news, right? Operator Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens Inc. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Jerry, I think you talked about the areas in industrial that are not doing better. But I was wondering... David A. Zinsner That was Vince actually. Vince is the one with the Irish accent, not Jerry. If you can't tell that one, then we got to get you a phone line. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division I was wondering if you guys could talk about areas in industrial that are actually doing well rather than to the normal industrial business. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Energy was doing very, very well, I'd say, at this point in time. We run R&amp;D investment over the last 3 years in industrial to get a much, much sharper, more intense focus in areas like factory automation and process control. And they've actually done well for this company over the last couple of years. The last 3 quarters have been -- the last 4 quarters have been tough. But as I said earlier, energy has been a good growth story, double-digit growth for the company for the past 4 or 5 years. And it's our expectation that we'd be able to get the industrial automation sector into kind of the 8% to 10% compounded growth over the coming years. Jerald G. Fishman To me, one of the encouraging parts of the industrial market right now is that when Vince goes out and visits these customers and occasionally convinces me to go with him, what you hear from those customers is that theyre always dragging us into some of these applications that we've never been in before because they understand that they're very challenging and they have a lot of respect for some of the core technologies that Analog has that they think is very applicable in some of these segments. So some of them are just -- we make the highest speed and most accurate converters and amplifiers as we always have and some of them are actually asking us to do a lot more integration for them than we've ever done in the past, either for reasons of speed, performance or cost or size. So I think increasingly is that the industrial business, which if you go back 5 years used to be, we have a lot of customers and we sell a lot of products to, I think increasingly there's an opportunity for us to really do a much more systems-oriented approach to some of these consumer -- some of these industrial applications. And certainly, we have one of the best capabilities in the world given our core technology to do those kinds of things for those customers. And when they look around and they look at the whole universe of companies that really have that level of technology and commitment to the industrial business, despite all the press releases and rhetoric out there, it's a very short list of companies that could actually do that for them. And we're certainly high on their list, I think, to do that. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Got it, that's very helpful. And again a question for either Jerry or Vince. I'm curious if there is anything like any kind of normal seasonality left in the industrial business at this point in time. Any quarters that are stronger than others that you've noticed in the past 2 or 3 years? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I would say that our second fiscal quarter is historically -- if you go back many years in the absence of any macroeconomic headwinds or tailwinds, our second quarter is typically our strongest industrial quarter because it has the most days in it basically. And when a lot of the systems comes to distribution, a lot of it is how many days of sales we get. But I would say right now the dominant factor remains the macro stuff. And I continue to believe that seasonality right now is a trap for everybody because other effects dominated much more so than seasonality. Operator Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division If you could, Jerry, you've been through a lot of cycles and if we look at this cycle, you've mentioned that clearly macro is weighing on it. Are there any things outside of macro that you think we should be looking towards to see when we're going to start to resume what we call sort of normal semiconductor growth patterns? And I'm referring maybe to the aging chart that you guys typically have shown investors that show the adoption of newer products in the market and details on your older products. Are you seeing any changes to those product uptakes? Jerald G. Fishman No. I mean I don't really think so, Doug. We've looked at that business chart every quarter quite methodically. And it turns out that all the reasons why that chart has been the way it is for the better part of 25 years, or longer actually, I think is still in place today. In industrial products, the average usage for application is relatively low. The performance criteria are very high and customers don't like to change. Even though they develop new products, they tend to bring along the level of technology that they're familiar with. So I think all those factors are still a very dominant factor in the industrial business. I think the only change, if there is one, is one of the comments I made just a little earlier in reference to the industrial market is I think there is an increasing opportunity to provide more systems level capability in the industrial market that is more tailored products to particular segments in the industrial market. And I think that's another just growth opportunity for Analog that I think didn't exist 5 or 10 years ago. So that's a very slow building phenomena. I still say the industrial market is very similar to the way it was 5 or 10 years ago. And I think if we continue to really win at the core technology level in amplifiers and converters and some of the other product areas that we're in, I think we'll continue to do extremely well in the industrial market, which values those characteristics probably more so than a lot of other markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division That's a good segue into sort of my next question. Over the last 5 or 6 years, you've done quite a nice job of sort of pruning and focusing your product segments that you're attacking. We saw you move a little bit out of DSP. It's sort of interesting, DSP is still holding on to a decent percentage of revenue there. It's a little better than I might have expected. Jerald G. Fishman That was always the goal. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And how do you feel about the positioning of the company now to service the new growth opportunities? Are there pieces missing? And are you -- do you need to focus some more effort again back into power management to deliver some of those solutions? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think there's always pieces missing in the puzzle. And we have a lot of opportunities to fill some of those pieces, either with acquisition or investment. I think in the power management part of the business, we've -- I think as we've mentioned previously, we've changed our strategy quite a bit over the last couple of years to really attach power management where we already control a large part of the bill of material than trying to compete in the broad based power business, which increasingly is getting overcrowded, and there's too many competitors in there right now. So I think our power management business now, we have some very talented people, but they are very focused on where we are in control of the signal processing bill of materials to add power capability. And we're getting very good take for that from our customers. I think in other areas, we've just made an acquisition in the very high performance clock area, which is an area that we're very familiar with. Every -- a large part of our converters are clocked by something. And we think there is some new technologies out there that can fundamentally change the game in clocking. And that's obviously a natural thing to sell alongside of our converters. We've made other acquisitions that we think will change some of the dynamics in the -- what you can deliver for what power dissipation and signal processing. So I think the areas that we'll continue to pick away at where we see either new technology emerging or holds or what we're trying to do for our customers. And I think we've done that in the past couple of years, and I think we'll continue to do that in the future. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Maybe a question for Dave, since Jerry and Vince are stealing all the airtime here. Dave, inventory were 120 in the quarter. You mentioned it would be down, but it's higher than a lot of your peers which are running below 100 days. And I guess my question is what is it about your mix that requires 4 months of inventory on hand? The implication would be that gross margins are inflated. David A. Zinsner Well we do carry a bit more inventory. We generally carry 100 to 110 days of inventory. We do that because we have a ton of different products. And we are very much focused on our ability to deliver in kind of short lead time environments. We think that in a lot of cases, it differentiates us from some of our competitors. So that's one primary reason why we keep -- we just generally keep a higher level of inventory. And that's quarter-over-quarter, so that doesn't necessarily inflate margins. We have built up inventory here in the near term, maybe a little bit higher than we would typically coming into several product cycles within the consumer space. And we need to be ramped in order to meet that demand. So that's the other driver. Most of that production is actually done outside. So we really don't get much in the way of absorption benefit from that. So that really didn't necessarily drive the gross margin, it more was a general factory utilization increase, which didn't have a huge impact on the inventory levels in the quarter. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division So lead time then for the company, you would estimate would be lower than a lot of your peers, and that ultimately translates into better revenue growth? Is that the way to think about it? David A. Zinsner Well it depends on the environment. Right now we're probably all in similar lead time environments. So when cycles turn up, we tend to be able to maintain our lead times within a 4- to 6-week period. We see a fair amount of our competitors see those stretched out. I think the last big cycle we had, some of them stretched out about 20 weeks. So we don't like that. We don't think that's good for our customers. So we try to control that as best as we can through just careful inventory management. Jerald G. Fishman The other part that Dave didn't mention is that the inventory doesn't go bad on us. We build inventory and very long life cycle products. I don't remember the last time we wrote off inventory in Analog of any consequence. So I think the trade-off that we make is we want to be able to keep our lead times short, it makes our order patterns more predictable. It makes the factories run smoother. It helps our gross margins from the standpoint of keeping the loading levels where -- that are stable. And we think ultimately that really helps us competitively. Operator Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division So you mentioned earlier that the key candidate to gross margin was going to be utilization rates rather than mix. Did you say what your gross margin will be if your utilization rates were to go back to the 80% level? And then if we need some additional mix improvement as well for you guys to get closer to 70% gross margin level, where would that mix opportunity come from? David A. Zinsner All we said was that our utilization when our margins were up in the 67% range, we're slightly above 80%. So I think that if our utilization was to get back over 80% given that a fair amount of that will be mix beneficial as well because industrial tends to drive utilization, we think our margins would be in that range. Outside of that, our goal is certainly to improve gross margins. We do have a number of things that we're working on to improve it. But we don't have any set target on gross margins per se. Really the function of why our margins are where they are is the function of our strategy of highly differentiated products in markets that we think value that -- those differentiated and high-performance products. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just a couple of quickies. Vince, can you give us a rundown of the linearity of bookings during the previous quarter and why you guys feel confident in guiding for normal seasonal growth this quarter? Did things just kind of erode during the first couple of months and then stabilize in July and getting better in August? Or was it a step function down in stability after that? Maybe just a little color there. Vincent T. Roche Chris, it was remarkably consistent over the past 2 quarters month by month in every region, across the 2 major channels. There was no -- I mean there were no anomalies, and it's remarkable in its steadiness. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division And so given the fact that you came at the low end of the range last quarter, why guide for normal seasonal growth this quarter? Vincent T. Roche Sorry, say that again? Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Given that you guys came in towards the low end of the range of guidance for revenue last quarter and I believe you're going for a close to normal seasonal growth this quarter, was there something that gave you some more confidence that things wouldn't erode like they did last quarter? Vincent T. Roche Certainly on the consumer side of things, we're expecting a lift this quarter. We're confident about that. And that would be the primary chunk of any increase we got this quarter in revenues. Jerald G. Fishman Well we have -- the most important thing is you have a larger opening backlog that we already booked, which we think is secure, and although you'll never know. And the projections that we're making about next quarter are based on that backlog. We're in a very high churn environment, so you never quite know what's going to happen in detail in distribution. But as Vince said, the trends are pretty stable and all that's a good thing. So I mean but there is -- the reason there's a range there is because nobody really knows. And we feel we have a pretty good -- if we knew we say what we know, but we're just telling you what the range of possibilities as we see it right now is it's based on a bunch of assumptions about most of the other businesses being about flat, which could change one way or the other. It's based on the backlog we have at consumer, which we think is good, but could change also. So I don't think we can get away from the fact that there's a lot of uncertainty in trying to predict revenues that our size -- plus or minus $10 million in the quarter is very, very challenging. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division That makes total sense. And then you guys said that the inventories were about 7.5 weeks essentially flat sequentially. Have you seen any change up or down from what you can tell in OEM inventory? David A. Zinsner Well the best way we can track it is just looking at their aggregate inventory. We don't have a visibility obviously into how much of our products is being held on their balance sheet. But their inventory levels just -- what we tend to do is take the top customers and track their days of inventory. And it was generally consistent with the prior quarter. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citigroup. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Two quick ones. The first one is you're expecting consumer to drive the entirety of growth in the October quarter. Is there any reason to not think that January revenues would be down sequentially then? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it all depends on what happens in the macro sense. If the macro stuff we -- the consumer stuff, it really depends on what happens with the product cycles in consumer and the macro economy. So one could say that might happen, but I can't say with any confidence that, that will happen. We'll have to just wait and see. But clearly, typically in normal times without any specific product momentum, you'd see the first quarter consumer being lower than the fourth quarter. On the other hand, some of those other businesses could go up in Q1. So we just don't know yet. And we're not prepared to sort of get ahead of this thing and go up with a forecast for Q1 while we're in the third week of Q4. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Fair enough. The follow-up question I had was regarding your process technology announcement with TSMC in a co-development of 0.18 process. Can you explain the rationale in making available jointly developed process to competitors potentially? Is the motivation of that to garner any sort of a royalty stream? Jerald G. Fishman Could you repeat the first part of that question? I didn't quite get it. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Sure. You had a press release this quarter about a co-development of a 0.18 process with TSMC that is being made available, I believe, to some of your competitors. I want to understand the motivation for that process development in making that available to competitors... Jerald G. Fishman Sure, I understand. Well some of the larger chips we do requires more advanced digital lithography, and so it's not a predominant part of what we do. Most of what we do with TSMC is 1 or 2 generations behind the most advanced stuff. But 0.18 is no longer the most advanced digital technology out there now. There are many companies working at 28 nanometers. So I would say it's a progression of what we've been doing with TSMC for many, many years. It's not really changed. And I think a lot of the stuff that's proprietary to Analog stays proprietary to Analog. That's the most important takeaway. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Are you garnering royalty stream for that? Is that the motivation? Jerald G. Fishman No, I do think the motivation is a royalty stream. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division This is Amit Chanda, dialing in for David Wong. Can you update us on your recent acquisition of Multigig in terms of your traction there for the high-end clock timing business? Vincent T. Roche We have -- at this point, we have fully integrated the team. We're very, very pleased with the progress that we're making in terms of incorporating the intellectual property that we acquired from Multigig. And we're actually starting to see -- the very, very first generation of product that they developed, we're starting to see some modest revenues. And we've moved them aggressively now into second-generation product design. So at this point, we're very, very pleased with what we see and what we're getting. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Okay, great. And then as a follow-up, Dave, in the context of today's macroeconomic environment, can you maybe talk about your expectations for ADI's R&amp;D budget in FY '12? And I guess should we be modeling R&amp;D at 17% of sales over the long run? David A. Zinsner Well I think what I said before, it's pretty accurate when we focus in on one of the line items within operating expenses, which is we're looking to kind of contain OpEx in the near term given the uncertainty in the macro environment. If things improve and revenue starts to grow, we're likely to grow both on the R&amp;D and SG&amp;A line to some level, but at a level that trails the revenue growth. Ultimately, we probably will want to run somewhere in that 17% of sales for R&amp;D. Ali Husain Folks, we have a number of people still waiting to ask questions. If we're not able to get your question in the allotted time you can reach me, Ali Husain, after the call at  461-3282. And before we take the last few questions, I would like to mention that our fourth quarter 2012 earnings release is scheduled for November 27, 2012, after which we'll host and our conference call will begin approximately 5 p.m. Eastern Time that same date. Now we're ready to take the additional questions. Operator Your question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division I wonder if you could update us just on your latest thoughts on the cash balance. I know you've been returning a lot of it to shareholders, but I know you've also been looking at options to return more. Can you just give us your latest thoughts there? David A. Zinsner Well I'll comment. I'm sure Jerry will have a comment as well. I think we've been focused in both ways in returning cash to shareholders, both through share repurchases and dividends. We just increased the dividend 20% a couple of quarters ago to ramp up that part of the equation. We have been buying back stock from quarter to quarter. It tends to be a little bit volatile depending on what the stock price is and how we're feeling about the world. We do have plenty of cash on the balance sheet in the U.S., which is where we would normally get the cash for repurchases. We have $1 billion. We also have capacity on the debt side, if we want to take advantage of that. We have a $585 million authorization to repurchase stock. So I think you'll see us be active repurchases of stock over time. It might change from quarter to quarter depending on the environment but over time, we will certainly be buyers of the stock. We'll also be very committed on the dividend side, I think, as well. We ramped up the payout ratio. I think we paid out plus 50% this quarter in terms of dividend, and I think you'll see us be fairly committed to the dividend. We talked to a number of our largest shareholders over -- clearly over the course of years, but certainly within the last few quarters and really felt like a significant portion of them seems to favor an increase in the dividend, and we responded to that by increasing this a couple of quarters ago. So that's really the goal. Clearly we are still focused on periodic small tuck-in technology acquisitions as well. And so certainly some portion of the cash will be used for that purpose as well. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division Guys, I just -- I'm curious about the utilization dropping in the October quarter. Just given your comments about stability in the business, at the midpoint, your sequential growth for the current quarter is actually going to be higher than the prior quarter, and you talked about inventories being in decent shape. So how do I read the drop of utilization? I apologize if it's nitpicking. I know it's only going to be down a little bit, but I was just kind of curious if you can give any color on that. Jerald G. Fishman Well I think the increase we're going to get on the sales line at least in the forecast right now is primarily consumer stuff. We primarily fabricate that not in our own facilities. So we looked at it and we say, we'd like to keep the inventory down more towards the 100 to 110 day area, as Dave said. And that -- and the reason we like to do that more than anything else is it gives us a lot more leverage on the upside when business gets better as compared to selling old inventory when business gets better. So we've -- in the old days, we would have just kept building it or leave it at the air. But I think now, we sense keeping it down to those levels is the best long-term decision for us. So that's what we're doing. I mean it doesn't really indicate either our enthusiasm or pessimism about the future. It's much more a question of that we have 121 days, we want to get it down to about 110 days, and most of the growth in Q4 is going to come out of stuff that we don't fabricate ourselves. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division And then guys just as a follow-on there. The cycle time through a fab is about how long? Jerald G. Fishman We have 350 processes we run in on those fabs, each has a different cycle time. But I think they range anywhere from probably 8 to 15 weeks depending on the complexity of the process. Ali Husain And that concludes our Q&amp;A session. We appreciate your participation. We look forward to talking to all of you again during our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call scheduled for November 27, 2012 beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time. Thanks very much.

"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices, Inc.  is scheduled to announce its fiscal first-quarter 2012 results on February 22, 2012. We witness limited movements in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release. Prior-Quarter Synopsis Analogs fourth quarter 2011 pro forma earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, or 4.8% due to weaker-than-expected revenue and margins, which in turn impacted earnings. Revenue in the quarter was $716.1 million, down 5.5% sequentially and 7.0% year over year, particularly due to the weakness in the communications and industrial end markets. However, the consumer segment performed well in the quarter on account of seasonal increase in demand for digital cameras, gaming systems and the like. Automotive was also up 11.2% sequentially. Gross margin of 64.3% was down both sequentially and year over year, impacted by an unfavorable mix and lower utilization rates, as Analog cut production to lower both internal and distributor inventories. First Quarter Guidance Analog expects first quarter revenue to decline 510% sequentially with the gross margin being 63% , operating expenses of $226229 million and diluted EPS of 4451 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 59 cents when the company reported earnings, well over the guided range.Agreement of Analysts Out of the 19 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, one made an upward revision in the last 30 days, while for fiscal 2012, one analyst made a downward revision over the same time period. The majority of analysts expect a decent first quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS  in line with the Street consensus estimates of $662 million and $0.48, respectively. Additionally, they anticipate gross margins in line with management guidance of 63.0% . The analysts expect to see strength in the automotive end market and stabilization in industrial and communications, which have remained weak thus far, driven by 3G deployments in China. They also contend that increasing semiconductor content in automobiles will drive the companys revenue growth. They also believe that order trends in the analog segment are improving and channel inventory is at a record low level. Hence, they expect to see strong recovery in the second half of 2012 driven by improved demand and inventory restocking. However, a handful of analysts do not expect a strong quarter due to a certain amount of softness in the industrial and communications business and uncertainty in the current environment. Magnitude of Estimate Revisions In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2012. Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 11 cents to 48 cents for the first quarter and 37 cents to $2.28 for fiscal 2012. The significant decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the 90-day period was in response to managements comments during the fourth quarter earnings call, following which a majority of analysts had lowered estimates. Our Recommendation Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. We remain encouraged by the companys dominant position in many of its product segments, and meaningfully improved gross and operating margin structures. However, we remain concerned about the tough macroeconomic environment and softness within the communications and industrial infrastructure markets. With customers continuing to cut inventories and typical first quarter seasonality, we do not expect Analog Devices to see a strong first quarter. Also, given that the company expects lower sales during Christmas and the lunar New Year, it will effectively have 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue in the upcoming quarter. Analog, which competes with other large analog players, such as Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology Corp , Maxim Integrated Products  and Texas Instruments , holds a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term Sell rating.

Subsequent events and development may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast, which is May 22, 2012. With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO, Jerry Fishman, for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, thanks, Maria, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. Our revenues in our second quarter totaled approximately $675 million, which was up slightly more than 4% sequentially, but down about 15% compared to the year-ago quarter. You might remember the year-ago quarter when ADI revenue peaked, as customers built inventory to reduce the risk of supply disruptions that were widely feared after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The industrial end markets, which are typically seasonally strong for ADI in the second quarter turned even better performance than we had planned and grew about 12% sequential. All of the major application areas within industrial grew sequentially, and it was led by over 20% sequential growth in both instrumentation and in energy. Health care and industrial automation, which includes process control, as well as defense, aerospace and security, also grew sequentially in the second quarter. In general, indications in the industrial market are that customers have stopped depleting inventory and our current orders more closely matched consumption levels, certainly much more closely than had been the case over the last few quarters. In the industrial market, ADI is well recognized as the best brand amongst the wide range of industrial applications, and many of these applications we now believe have the potential for above market growth rates in the future. Revenues also increased sequentially from communications infrastructure customers, as both wired and wireless applications grew about 3% sequentially. Communications order rates began very slowly in the early parts of Q2, but improved significantly toward the end of the quarter. For the past few quarters, operators have worked to increase capacity at minimal cost by implementing software upgrades rather than hardware upgrades. But to date, networks in many regions of the world are very much overloaded, and operators find it difficult to respond to significantly higher bandwidth requirements from applications, such as streaming video by using existing equipment. As a result of new equipment upgrade cycles, ADI's leading technology portfolio and very strong customer relationships with the largest market shareholders in the infrastructure market, we expect our sales into communications applications to grow throughout the second half of our fiscal year and also into 2013. Automotive revenues were down very slightly in the second quarter, but increased 10% year-over-year as a result of strong worldwide vehicle unit growth, increasing electronic content and increasing ADI content in cars. ADI, as you know, is very well-positioned in the major systems in the wide range of automobiles, and we expect the automotive market to continue to offer very strong growth prospects for ADI going forward, as it has over the past 3 to 5 years. Revenues from consumer customers declined 8% sequentially, in line with the seasonally weak second quarter time period for consumer products. However, even in the consumer market, orders from consumer customers picked up late in the second quarter, and we now expect our consumer business will grow sequentially in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter as a result of better underlying demand and I think very importantly, a very strong ADI design-in activity at the top of consumer brands. On a regional basis, all regions except North America experienced sequential increase in both revenue and also in end customer bookings. On a worldwide basis, end customer bookings increased 8% sequentially, and the book-to-bill for the quarter was above 1. Our best sense at this point is that the order expansion that we are experiencing is a result of a combination of the end of customer destocking, a incrementally better outlook at many of our customers and also our distributors and also what we believe is the beginning of what will be a very strong new product cycle at ADI. In aggregate, ADI's second quarter performance was strong on virtually every measure. We met or exceeded our plan for growth and profits for the quarter, and we are continuing to deliver exceptional cash flow. So Dave will now take you through some of the details of our financial results, and after Dave's done, I'll come back and talk a little bit about the outlook going forward. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, second quarter revenue increased 4.2% sequentially and declined 14.6% year-over-year to $675.1 million. Our gross margin was 65.2% in the second quarter. This was up 200 basis points from the 63.2% we reported in the first quarter, driven by a favorable mix of high-margin industrial and communications infrastructure products and increased factory utilization. Second quarter gross margin represented a drop-through of approximately 115% on the incremental sales. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. With these very short lead times from ADI, we are experiencing a very high proportion of orders for delivery in the quarter as our customers understand that our products are readily available rather than customers building long-term backlog to ensure supply. Operating expenses for the second quarter were $227.5 million compared to about $226 million in the prior quarter. The slight dollar increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation and to a lesser degree, annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Operating expenses declined sequentially as a percent of revenue by 120 basis points. And headcount in the second quarter remained essentially flat to the previous quarter's level. Operating profits before tax for the second quarter were $212.9 million or 31.5% of sales. This was 320 basis points higher than the prior quarter's operating profits of 28.3% of sales. Operating profits increased as a result of the higher revenue and increased factory utilization in the second quarter. Other expense was $1.5 million in the second quarter compared to $3.3 million in the first quarter. Our ongoing run rate for net interest expense should be approximately $3 million. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 23%, in line with the prior quarter's 22.6% but higher than our prior expectations. The higher rate was primarily due to a shift in income to higher tax jurisdictions. We expect our effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarter to be approximately 22.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the second quarter was at the high end of our guidance as a result of our strong growth from these high-margin products. Cash flow in the second quarter continued to be strong. We generated 33.5% of our revenue or $226 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $30 million, resulting in free cash flow of $196 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter. Our accounts receivable balance increased from the prior quarter by $28 million due to higher sales. However, our days sales outstanding decreased to 45 days from the prior quarter's 46 days. We continue to carefully manage inventory, both at ADI and our distribution partners to keep our total inventory well positioned to respond quickly to customers. In the second quarter, inventory at ADI increased by a modest 2% compared to the prior quarter. On the days of inventory basis, ADI inventory decreased to 118 days from 122 days in the prior quarter. While a bit above our inventory model of a 100 to 110 days, we believe this makes sense given inventory in the channel is still low compared to historical levels, and there was a wide range of possible demand levels for the next few quarters. We remain committed to maintaining very short lead times to avoid double ordering and to provide best-in-class service levels to our customers. During the second quarter, we repurchased $44 million of our stock. We also distributed approximately $89 million or 55% of net income in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the second quarter was approximately $3.8 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion is available domestically. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $863 million in debt outstanding. On May 21, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on June 12, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1. At the current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3.3%. In summary, second quarter delivered solid results. Our operating model turned a 4% sequential increase in revenue into a 15% sequential increase in diluted EPS. At gross margins of 65.2% and operating margins of 31.5%, we still have leverage ahead, as sales increase, factory utilization improves and we continue to prudently manage the growth in operating expenses well below our sales growth rate. And now I'll turn the call back over Jerry to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Thanks, Dave. For the third quarter of 2012, we're planning for our revenues to grow sequentially in the range of 1% to 4%. We're planning for the industrial market to grow sequentially again in Q3, although certainly at a slower rate compared to the very significant sequential rise in Q2, as we enter the seasonally weaker second half of the year for industrial products. As I mentioned earlier, orders from communications infrastructure customers picked up momentum in the latter part of the second quarter. And as a result, our third quarter plan for communications infrastructure is for sales also to grow sequentially. We expect automotive revenues to be about flat sequentially in Q3 and revenues from consumer applications to grow sequentially as a result of seasonality and also what we expect to be a very strong new product cycle for our consumer products. We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 basis points from the 65.2% we achieved in Q2, which if we achieve the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we'll generate more than 80% in drop-through on incremental sales. We anticipate operating expenses of approximately $231 million, a slight increase primarily as a result of a full quarter with the annual salary increases that went into effect in April and variable compensation increasing as margins continue to improve. Based on those estimates and excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.58 in the third quarter. So in closing, while the data we have points to 3Q being another solid quarter for ADI, we continue to be mindful of the global macro-environment that we are operating in. We're very focused on providing our customers with the very best technical support and the most responsive supply chain. Internally, of course, we're focusing on the things that we can control, bringing breakthrough products to the market, looking for continuing efficiency gains wherever we spend money and wherever we apply resource and engaging every employee at Analog in the fight to get higher sales and higher margins. Maria Tagliaferro Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you, Dave. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division If I could, I guess, I'll start with just the revenue line. It does appear to be a little light of where we might think business might be if we were in sort of a normal semiconductor, if there is such a thing, recovery cycle. Can you comment on how you think the macro-environment is impacting your customer base and maybe if you guys have taken any actions of your own as a result of the nervousness out in the marketplace? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think, Doug, the only thing that we could do is be suitably cautious given all the sort of macroeconomic issues out there. I think it's at the margin that makes our customers worry a little bit more than they would if everything was going well in every geography. But no, I still sense that most of our customers are looking out there and saying things are pretty good and that they're expecting to get growth. Typically, our third quarter seasonality is all over the map. There were some third quarters we actually grow 5% or 6% to 7%; other ones, we contract 4% to 6%, other ones are right in the middle. In fact, if you look at the average for the last 3 years, each one of which was a unique year. The average of those last 3 years was about 2% third quarter. So I think what we're trying to do is listen to all the positive vibes we're getting from the customers and make sure we have capacity in response to that. But yet internally, manage the company to try to keep as much flexibility as we can in case the macroeconomic situation gets worse. Now, Vince, you have some other -- you've been out there talking to -- particularly the industrial investor. Vincent T. Roche Yes. If you look at the geographic context on this thing, I would say from a number of conversations I've had with our large distributors, as well as our customers, particularly in the industrial sector, I'd say there's a general sense that Europe still has to work through the crisis. People have been very, very careful in terms of laying out cash, particularly for CapEx-oriented equipment. I think the inventories are going to be very, very lean. But I think we're at a point now as well where the inventories at our customers have got a very healthy and in line with consumption rates. I think the sense is that, that America is pretty stable. Everybody's watching China -- there are mixed reports in China. Some see it as very, very strong for the next couple of quarters, some not so strong. And Japan also seems to be pretty stable. Jerald G. Fishman So I think really the summary comment is that if we just listen to the feedback we're getting from our customers, we might put out more optimistic plan for next quarter. But I think we have to be cautious when you listen to what's going on macro-economically. And that's what I think our guidance reflects. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Great. If I could, for my follow-up just on the comment you made, Jerry, regarding a strong product cycle in the consumer segment that you're expecting. Can you just remind us, does that consumer segment include your handsets? And would that be -- if you could offer some more color there, that would be helpful. Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think -- as you know, when we've talked about previously, we really narrowed down our focus in the consumer business for those areas that we really think we can make not only a significant technology contribution but one that will last more than a few months or a few calendar quarters. And I'd say where our product offering is particularly strong right now is in the portable side. And that encompasses many different types of portable formats. And particularly in the audio and image processing, dimensions of that. So we have good products that represents a lot of mainstream analog technology, and based on the feedback we're getting from some of the top consumer companies, the design-in rate of those products seems pretty good. And if we believe their forecast for the second half, that should raise our consumer business in the next couple of quarters. But it's mostly focused on the portable area, I would say. Operator The next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster from Macquarie. Deepon Sen Gupta  This is Deepon for Shawn. Could you actually just talk about the current quarter where you're seeing orders from the end market and geographic perspective? Do you see order rates pick up? I know there's some talk about some order rates and maybe very strong for some of your competitors? Vincent T. Roche Yes. I'd say over the last couple of months, what we've seen is stabilization on the industrial side and a pickup in the communications infrastructure orders, in particular. The automotive also has been a great growth driver for the company over the last few years. And in order continues to be strong. My expectation is that in the second half and the 3Q that based on the order trends we're seeing, that market will behave pretty well for us as well. Deepon Sen Gupta  And when you're thinking the out-quarter, can you talk about where utilization rate is going to go and how much benefit we should see from utilization rate or how much we should see from mix? And also if you could give the utilization rates for the past quarter, that will be about helpful as well. David A. Zinsner So utilization in the second quarter was about 70%. We're expecting utilization to be in that range for the third quarter. It did pick up from, I think, it was 67-ish percent the prior quarter. So it added probably 50 basis points or so. The mix certainly contributed as well. What was your other question related to that? Deepon Sen Gupta  So just going forward, how do we anticipate mix impacting gross margins? David A. Zinsner Well, utilization's going to be flat. So I don't think that, that's going to benefit -- at the moment, we're predicting that mix will be relatively similar to what it was in the second quarter. So I doubt that, that will have much benefit. Really the improvement will get in the gross margin sequentially is going to be more just from the higher revenue level. Operator Next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital. Emily Scudder This is Emily calling in for Ambrish. Can you discuss what regions are driving the growth in your communications infrastructure end market segment, and what regions you're expecting to be the strongest contributors to ADI in the second half of the fiscal year and fiscal '13? Vincent T. Roche Yes. I mean, all regions in the second quarter registered growth. America was relatively flat. But all regions grew. My expectation is that given what we're seeing on the end market side, there won't be much change in terms of the regional mix in, I believe, the third quarter. Jerald G. Fishman I think also our question was more related to communications. Vincent T. Roche Yes. On the communications side, well as you know, our business in the communication sector is very, very global. We supply products to all the sectors of equipment, such as GSMs, all the 3G standards, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, LTE on the 4G side. And I think particularly in America, you're going to see some significant capital deployments in the third and fourth quarter and also China. So I think Europe is probably on communications infrastructure side going to be somewhat tepid, but that's my sense based on what we heard from customers and what carriers seemed to be saying. And Japan has been quite good both on the wired and wireless side over the last quarter or 2. My expectation is that will remain steady. Emily Scudder Okay. And then can you comment on what your expectations are as far as distributor inventory as we exit this quarter, and how that might vary by the different regions? David A. Zinsner Yes. Days of inventory right now at distribution is around 7.5 weeks, that's a little bit below the target, which I think we generally think of as 8 weeks. I would guess, over time, that will migrate its way up to 8 weeks, but we don't have any insight as to when that will happen. And I think that it's pretty consistent across the geographies. Vincent T. Roche Yes. I think given the strength in supply as well, I think distributors are not incentivized, there's any particular reasons to hold at this point in time. Jerald G. Fishman And we're not incentivizing to give it to them. Operator Next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division I guess first question, Jerry, you talked about conservatism or cautious given the macro picture, but at the same time, it sounds like your visibility, particularly on the comm and consumer side is a little bit better. So I guess what I'm trying to ask and ask it directly is if we didn't have this kind of macro uncertainty, what kind of top line growth do you think we could see in Q2? Jerald G. Fishman I mean that's very hard to predict. I'd say just qualitatively, the only I can say is that if we had more macro certainty, we were sure that the economy was going to be no worse than neutral, I think our expectations for revenues will be higher. How much and what that number is, I'd just be guessing. And I don't think that serves either of us. But certainly, that macroclimate is -- I mean you have to be sobered by it. You can't see what's going on or read the newspaper every day and listen to all the commentary and not at least be a little concerned about how that might impact our business. So I think that's what our guidance is reflecting. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Okay. I guess have you seen a pullback in terms of customers' asks? And it's flowing into your order book? Or is this more of a more cautionary stance just heading into what you may think you're going to see? Jerald G. Fishman I think it's more of the latter than the former. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Great. If I could just ask one last question, Dave. What should we be thinking about for tax rate in fiscal '13? David A. Zinsner I would plan it to be somewhere in the 22% range. Operator Next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division So if we took all the macro uncertainty we all read about, what do you think your best guess would be for whatever is close to a normal seasonal quarter this quarter? And then what would be a normal seasonal quarter for next quarter in terms of revenue growth? Jerald G. Fishman I think the best way I can answer that is that we haven't had this seasonally normal quarter in 3 years. David A. Zinsner 4 years. Jerald G. Fishman 4 years, actually, Dave reminds me. So I think the trends for each of the market segments is much more dominant than the seasonality that we see. In the earlier days when our business was mostly military, industrial and so on, it was pretty easy to just figure that out. But I think with consumer business, the communications business, automotive businesses, those are not businesses that respond to typical seasonality as compared to what's going on in those particular market segments that are more on a secular way of thinking about it than a seasonal way of thinking about it. So very hard to predict. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we went back and looked at seasonality for the last 3 or 4 years, and we couldn't figure out what it was, looking at all the data, of 16 quarters worth of data to try to figure out seasonal patterns. We couldn't figure out any seasonality, so very hard to predict that. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Can you tell us what sort of turns business you're expecting this quarter, and then what it was last quarter? What would be typical? David A. Zinsner Chris, our standard response on that is we don't really quote that number, only because most or at least half of our revenue is distributor based, so we have the backlog coming in from the distributors, but we don't recognize it until it ships out. I mean I think Jerry said qualitatively that we're in a higher turns like environment. We don't put a number to it. But nevertheless, clearly, customers are not layering in tons of backlog. They're not ordering until they really need it. And so we have quoted 4-week lead times, about how much time it takes from the time we get an order to the time we're shipping at this point. Jerald G. Fishman And in fact, the large part of the product lines are quite a bit less than 4 weeks. In fact, it's probably 4 hours. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji from UBS. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Jerry, can I just ask you a question and I'm -- probably something I don't fully understand. You talked about some of the infrastructure customers to be more of a software upgrade rather than a hardware upgrade. Any comment as to what extent you were able to stretch that and in what types of technologies? I mean is it within 3G or I think another 3G level? And why you think that they will have to stop that now and do more of a hardware upgrade? I just want to get a bit more insight as to the comment. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. Vince, is going to answer that. Vincent T. Roche Most of our business, the GSM or 2G component of our businesses is becoming smaller and smaller over time, so most of the, if you like, the upgrades that are being managed through software largely in 3G systems today. But it's only so far that, that will get you because every year, data requirements are increasing twofold. There's 90 million 4G-enabled handsets out there today, and they all require with an insatiable appetite for more and more bandwidth, which is driving -- this data is driving the need for expanded bandwidth RF transceivers. That's our game in the wireless arena and higher frequency requirements as well across multiple different geographies with different spectrum needs. So our sense is from talking to some carriers, talking to our customers, the second half of this year is going to see an upgrade in the equipment at the 3G and particularly 4G level. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay. Well, that's helpful. Let me just ask a different question. Jerry, in terms of understanding the target inventory for customers, I mean, I think what Dave explained that the target is for 8 weeks and you're currently at 7.5 weeks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's in distribution. Just to clarify things... Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division In distribution exactly, distribution. Let me understand it. I mean because we've -- last year, I think starting from 2009, there was all this talk about inventory moving down to slightly lower level over time because of improvements in VMI. And is there any reason why we shouldn't assume 7.5 weeks is now the new normal and why 8 weeks will be -- and the reason I ask this is because it kind of influences our assumption about a future tailwind coming from inventory restocking. Is that -- do you think 7.5 weeks is kind of where we should be modeling now, in which case we can conclude was normalized in terms of channel inventory? Jerald G. Fishman I think there's no meaningful distinction between 7.5 weeks and 8 weeks. Maybe 7.5 is the new norm or 7.2 or 8.3. We just don't know. But we're saying that it doesn't impact much what we do. So whether the new norm is 7.5 or the new norm is 8, I mean we're going to still do the same thing. We're going to have inventory available when our customers or distributors need it. And that's what we've done through the last couple of cycles and it significantly improved our competitive position relative to those who tried to, call it, more tightly than that. And I think that's what we're going to do going forward. I think there is no meaningful distinction to us of how we operate the business whether the new norm is 7.5 or 8 weeks. David A. Zinsner In particular because we don't recognize the revenue until it ships out from the distributor. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. So let's say it doesn't impact anything the way we run the business. So if we could be equally predictive on other measures in Analog, I'd be quite happy. Operator Next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Somewhat related question on inventory. Just to be clear, does your guidance assume any customer restocking in the out-quarter? Or is the growth in the quarter just coming from some combination of a pickup and then demand and/or customers just continuing to get their orders back in line with their demand? Jerald G. Fishman Again, it's hard to be quantitatively precise to answer your question. But I'd say that lion's share of what our guidance includes is customer's order and consumption. That's where we think most customers are in their thinking right now. Vincent T. Roche Our customers are indicating that the -- across the broad customer base particularly in the infrastructure area, the CapEx area like industrial and communications infrastructure that their inventories are at a very normal level now and very much in line with consumption. So I think that, that cycle overbuild is finished and customers are back to a normal order pattern. Jerald G. Fishman I mean I think in the de minimis level, there are still some customers that are destocking that we've heard of and there are some customers that are going to restock a little bit. But the predominant mode most customers are in, and we've said that we believe they're going to be ordering what they use. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division That's helpful. And for a follow-up, as we go through these cycles, normally what happens is something causes lead times to begin to stretch out a little bit and that's what starts the customers to reorder a little more, build a little more inventory or move away from the high-turns components that they're putting on you guys right now? Last time, obviously it was testing capacity that caused lead times to stretch. Other cycles, it's been other things. I know it's difficult to predict, but what kinds of things do you see out there that could potentially cause lead times to stretch out a little bit this quarter and kind of begin that cycle all over again? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we can only speculate about that. Certainly, we've heard anecdotes about foundry capacity getting a little bit tighter. We know that many of the assembly test subcontractors are thinly capitalized, so they don't carry a lot of extra capacity. So I think if the order trends start getting more confirmed and more positive, I think most semiconductor companies are reporting an improved order environment. I think if that continues with the relative scarcity of capacity out there, I think lead times for those that aren't thinking about it clearly could extend. Our goal is to not have that happen. Our goal is to really stay on top of this and keep our lead times in the range that they've been in. And if we do that, then that creates no need for customers to double or triple order and confuse us, and by definition, our investors. So I mean our goal is to really watch that carefully and keep the lead times short. It helps our customers, it helps you, it helps us. And that's what we're going to do with the cycle, just like we did in the last cycle. Those are the pressure points, typically. I think most semiconductor manufacturers have capacity in sight that's available to ramp up. We certainly do. So I think the pressure points will likely be on the outside, not necessarily on the inside. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division This is Aashish Rao for Vivek. A couple questions on the consumer front. In January, I think, you had indicated that Thailand floods had impacted some of the consumer in home entertainment builds, and you'd also indicated that your expected consumer to be up slightly in April. But then sales kind of declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. I mean could you give some color on that? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we were wrong. I think our consumer business, just across many different segments of it went down. Part of it was inventory that got a little too high, higher than we had thought. Secondarily, there were some products that -- in some end markets that weren't selling particularly well. The consumer cycle was not a strong cycle in the last 3 months. So I think those things qualitatively made our estimate wrong. We were also wrong in the industrial side where we thought it was going to be much lower than it is. And these parts of the cycle at the inflection points, it's very challenging to figure out what the aggregate is going to be, and I'd say even more challenging to figure out what any of the individual segments are going to do at least in the short term. I think that's part of the challenge now with all the changes that are going on to try and figure out the segment growth. We try to give you the internal plan that our product and market salespeople have in each of those segments. We try to give you a little more color at least directionally where we think it's going to happen. But very typically, we're happy to get the aggregate right. The individual categories are very volatile. It's very hard to get that correct. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay, got it. And then it just sounded also on the call that you are excited about some new product cycles in the consumer segment and this is even after the divestitures of the computing and the handset, x those products, I mean your sales from, say, fiscal year '10 and you're averaging about $155 million or so a quarter. I mean right now you're at $108 million. I mean is this just the cyclical recovery that you're expecting in consumer? Or are there really some new product cycles? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I'd say it's predominately new products that we've refocused on as we've decreased investments in consumer products that we didn't think fit well with our long-term portfolio. So I think we've decreased investments. In some of those areas, we refocused them on areas that we think are suitable for the product mix and the margin models that we have for the company. And I think those products will be well received. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. So should we expect any kind of the growth rate target you have for this business off the bottom? Jerald G. Fishman Why don't you give us a couple more quarters, and then we'll talk about it? Operator Next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division David, I was hoping you could comment on any internal efforts you guys are making in terms of gross margin improvements? Basically just looking for an update on some of the pricing strategy efforts you've been making and some of the efforts on making products more easy to -- or more efficiently to manufacture? David A. Zinsner Yes, I mean all of those are progressing. And I think we're in kind of middle innings of making improvement in both those areas. We do believe there will be tailwinds to our gross margin. The biggest thing, of course, that will improve the gross margin is to get the utilization up. And so getting the business back to the levels we saw in 2011, I think, would have been the biggest driver for gross margin. Jerald G. Fishman I think last time, our gross margin got up to about 67%. There is a lot of conversations about were those anomalous or were there onetime things that were driving that up, because it was so much higher than it's been in Analog, at ADI historically. I think the fact that we got back over 65%, at below 60 -- $700 million of revenues is a very good sign that the kind of improvements that we made are not fleeting, that they're permanent and that we have pretty good expectations on the gross margins for the company as revenues build, as Dave said. I think that those numbers this quarter on the gross margin were very encouraging to us. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Right. And just as a follow-up on that, to what extent can you get, let's say in a better more normalized macro-environment, to what extent can you get above that, the 67%? And just to sneak one more in, can you talk a little bit about what OpEx dollars might look like over the next several quarters assuming some modest sequential revenue growth, I mean as we sort of reach the dollar plateau here now that you've added in these extra items you mentioned earlier? Or is that -- will that still keep expanding? Jerald G. Fishman Dave, I'll turn it over to you on the expected, then I'll talk a little bit about the margins. David A. Zinsner Okay. So on the OpEx side, we are expecting it to obviously increase this quarter. It's a little bit, I think, a little around half the rate of the revenue growth. We did better than that, obviously, in the current quarter. And that's generally our goal, to try to expend -- grow expenses at a rate that's below the rate of revenue growth, get good fall through to the operating margin line. Jerald G. Fishman I think on the question of the margins, the margins are a combination of price and cost. Somebody asked earlier, we're continuously ensuring that we get paid fairly for our products. So I think that helps us. We're continuously setting tougher cost objectives on the products. Our goal is to be -- from here to be increasing the gross margin sequentially as the revenues go up. And if we continue to do that, I think everyone will be very happy with the gross margins we get. Operator The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, I appreciate the candid acknowledgment to the uncertain macro. As you look around today and assess the backdrop that you have, how would you compare it to the same time last year? What are the positives and what are the headwinds? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think this time last year, we were really worried that not only were there sort of macro issues developing, but there was a significant amount of inventory that was in the channel out there. People really inventoried up much more so than we or anybody else have thought during the earthquakes and tsunamis that happened around that time. And so we were faced with a situation where you had macro sort of demand issues, at the same time you had very significant inventory out there with our customers and in the distribution channel. And the intersection of those 2 things took a big whack out of all of us. I think where we are today is -- we still have macroeconomic issues, some would argue that they're closer to getting resolved, some would take a different point of view on that. But certainly this time, relative to what consumption rates are, there's not a lot of inventory out there that channels compound that issue. So I think from that standpoint, Craig, I think we feel like there's less downside with -- than there was a year ago at this time. And I think at the same time, with the customer cycles that we're hearing about from our customers, I think there's more upside potential. So qualitatively, I think sitting here today a year after all those events last year, we're feeling better than we feel a year ago. It's certainly not without risk, but better. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division That's helpful. And then a follow-up for you, Dave. You guys did a great job with the dividend increase a quarter ago. And just by that and buying back stock the cash balance still moved up. So how should we think about how you're thinking about cash management? David A. Zinsner Well, we're obviously anxious to return the cash in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. I think we'll continue to do that. Obviously we built a lot -- or we generate a lot of cash, which is a high-class problem. But, however, I think you will see us continue to be committed in both buybacks and dividend growth going forward. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division And what's the percentage of cash that's in the U.S. versus overseas at this point? David A. Zinsner I think I mentioned we have $1.1 billion in the U.S. The rest is overseas. Operator The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division For the first one, how do we think about the impact of what sounds like a very strong potential consumer cycle into the back half in 2013 on gross margins? Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers of margin into the back half and as we exit the year around product mix given some of those cycles around utilizations and growth as well, maybe some of the other initiatives that you're targeting? Jerald G. Fishman I think on the consumer side, I wouldn't want to let the expectations run away with us here. What -- the reason we mentioned it is that we've been very clear that we were really narrowing our reach in the consumer business to applications that add a lot of value to the customers and, therefore, were valuable to us. And I think we're beginning to see the fruit of that. I don't think -- we're talking about numbers that are going to fundamentally change the needle. I think consumer applications typically carry somewhat lower gross margins than the average, particularly in the industrial business. But at the same time, they carry very high operating margin since below the line, there's not a lot of expense. So I think carefully managed and carefully executed consumer business is a fine business. It shows you how to be very careful of what you do and who you do it with, or who you do it for in order -- so you don't get banged around by product cycles that are out of your control and margins that result from being in that vise. So I think it's important, and I want to clarify that we're not talking about any huge disruption here that all of a sudden, we're going to have a lot more consumer revenue than we've had historically. It's just we have couple good product cycles incrementally, it's going to make our computer business grow a little bit, it's been declining -- or our consumer business rather will grow a little bit where it's been declining, and I think that's going to help the top line a little bit. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. So to be clear, you don't foresee mix, I guess, turning a little more negative on the gross margin front as we exit the year then? Jerald G. Fishman Given Dave's guidance on the gross margin, I don't think so. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. And for my follow-up, sequentially on the automotive market, auto has been very strong for you and for a number of other players for the last few quarters. What's your point of view on the stability of that auto strength, again, as we -- as we're cycling for the rest of the year, maybe into 2013? Do you think that what we're seeing is actually a stable unit growth? Is there any chance that what we're seeing potentially is pull forward of demand? Can you give us some view of how much of the upside you've seen is actually been unit growth versus overall electronic content increasing versus your design win traction increasing? Vincent T. Roche It looks like this year, the number of cars that are sold worldwide will reach maybe 80 million, up about 5%. And the content, the electronic content per car continues to increase. From our perspective, we're very well positioned. We play with all the leaders worldwide. We have a particularly strong position with European OEMs who are doing extraordinarily well in the world market, particularly in America and Asia. So my sense is that the growth pattern we've seen will continue for the remainder of the year if we have another good year in automotive, and for the next number of years as well. So all the indications are that we'll see a growth here in terms of units, car units and growth in electronic content. So we're feeling very positive about it. Operator Next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Bheeshm Chaudhary - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division This is Bheeshm Chaudhary for Ross. Just a quick question. I was curious what your revenue guidance would be for the next quarter if you recognize distribution sales on a -- or distribution revenue on a sell-in basis? David A. Zinsner We have no idea. We don't measure it that way, and so we don't pay any attention to it. Jerald G. Fishman Although, I expect it will be higher. Operator The next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda from ISI Group. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division One question I have on the comm infrastructure stuff where you're expecting a pickup in the back half. I guess my question was, is that just based on a general sense that spending needs to revive? Or do you have some specific indication from your customers, perhaps in specific geographies that suggest that you'll indeed see a nice pick up in the third and the fourth quarter of this year? Vincent T. Roche Well, for example, China Unicom, who's a WCDMA operator, they've been very vocal as have AT&amp;T about the LTE deployment. So I think if you look at some of the carriers, they're being a lot more aggressive and determine on what they're going to do in the second half. And our customers also are seeing their order books firm up. So I think it's not just wishful thinking. My sense is based on the order streams that we're seeing in the last couple of months and what we're hearing from our customers and the carriers, that there is real demand in the market to continue to build out macrocells in particular. And I think over the next 18 months, which you're going to see is a very aggressive move towards small cell architectures as well to supplement the macrocells. So our expectation, by the way, over the coming few years, this year, there will be somewhere in the region of -- I believe, somewhere in the region of 1 million macrocells in production, deployed I should say, 1.1 million, 1.2 million. And what we're expecting is over the next 3 to 4 years, that, that will probably triple or quadruple. So there's going to be a major build-out that we're kind of gliding into over the next 2 to 3 quarters, I believe. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay, that was very helpful. And then for my follow-up, Dave, I know you don't guide to turns, but perhaps you could tell us what do you think, it's directionally up, down or flat, and/or whether you expect any difference in distributor versus OEM sales or order patterns through the course of July quarter? David A. Zinsner It is down, I would say, probably directionally, as Jerry kind of made a comment about it, I think, early on that qualitatively, we think that increasingly that particularly the OEM customers are shortening their lead times and putting more on turns basis. As far as OEMs versus disty I believe our expectation is that OEMs will be growing a little bit faster than disty the next quarter. Operator And the next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Looking forward, can you tell us what are your highest priorities are in terms of either product segments or end market segments for R&amp;D investment? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think the way we look at R&amp;D is now everything we're doing is a priority, because all the ones that weren't, we're not doing anymore. So that's a simple way to look at it. There are market segments or product segments in each of the end markets that we believe are very favorable and a good match to the technology that we have, where we can offer products our competitors can't do. So I don't think that there's any one particular market that we're favoring more than the others. If we are investing R&amp;D in a market, then we think it's a good -- we're going to get a good return on it or we're not going to invest. So I think the segments that we've talked about, the industrial segments, there is 10 or 11 segments in there, the communications infrastructure market, the consumer market, particularly as related to portable products, I think those are all high priorities for us, which is why we're putting a fair amount of R&amp;D into all those things. Maria Tagliaferro Okay. Well, I believe that was the last question that we had in the queue. So that brings us right up to the 6:00 hour. Jerald G. Fishman Very disciplined, good. Maria Tagliaferro Yes. So we want to thank everyone for joining us. Just as a reminder, the third quarter earnings call is scheduled for August 21, and that will start again at 5 p.m. Eastern time.

My name is Natalie and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I will like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Miss Tagliaferro, you may begin your conference. Maria Tagliaferro Okay. Thank you, Natalie, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Maria Tagliaferro, Director of Corporate Communications for ADI. Here with me now are Jerry Fishman, our President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; and Vincent Roche, Vice President of Sales and Strategic Market segment. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you haven't yet seen our first quarter fiscal year 2012 release or the release announcing an increase in the dividend, you can find both on our IR website at investor.analog.com. A recording of this conference call will also be available on the website within about 2 hours of the call's conclusion. I would like to point out that there were 14 weeks of activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, that compares to a typical 13 weeks in a quarter. From time to time during today's conference call, we will point out the impact of this additional week on historical and projected trends.  The 14-week quarter occurs because ADI follows a fiscal year calendar of 52 weeks per year. As a result, there is an extra week approximately every fifth or sixth year, and to adjust for that one day difference between our fiscal year and the typical 365-day calendar year. Finally, I'd ask you to please note that the information that we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liabilities established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q which was filed today.  The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is February 22, 2012. With that, I'll turn the call over to opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald G. Fishman Well good afternoon to everybody. As you can tell from our press release, our revenues in the first quarter totaled about $648 million, which was a decline of 9.5% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. And although within the range we provided last quarter, it was at the lower end of that guidance range.  Continuing inventory reduction by both our customers and distributors in November and December, coupled with lower capital spending by many of our customers, reduced orders on ADI and that continued the trend that began about 6 or 9 months ago. Nevertheless and happily, order rates and orders began accelerating in January and have continued strong into February, which leads us to believe that our first quarter may represent the sales gross margin and operating margin trough of this cycle for ADI. And we expect to resume growth in our second quarter, which began in early February.  We believe that customer and distributor inventories are reaching levels commensurate with the now revised outlooks and many of our larger customers have become marginally more optimistic and are beginning to free up some of their capital budgets. I'll provide a few more specifics on the short-term outlook towards the end of the call. In the first quarter, our sales, into virtually every end market except automotive, declined sequentially and year-over-year. In the first quarter, automotive sales actually increased 6% sequentially and 26% year-over-year as ADI continued to benefit from increased ADI dollar content per vehicle and increased vehicle unit sales worldwide. We would expect that our automotive sales to remain strong in our second quarter.  Industrial revenues declined 8% sequentially in Q1 for the third consecutive quarter of declines. The decline was very broad-based across customer tiers and geographies and of course industrial automation, energy instrumentation and health care applications. As has been the case now for several quarters, order rates from industrial customers appear to be well below consumption rates for our products for the first 2 months of our first quarter, but have recently been showing some good signs of improvement, which of course is very welcome news for us, since the industrial market represented 45% of our revenues in Q1 and remains our highest margin business. Based on these trends, we expect that industrial revenues will increase in the second quarter after now 3 quarters of sequential decline. The communications infrastructure end market also declined in the first quarter. Continued economic uncertainty, some country-specific regulatory issues and disruption from the failed AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger all contributed to widespread deferral of orders for new systems in favor of temporary improvements, mostly software and network capacity. Communications was 19% of revenues and declined 13% sequentially. While at this point in time, we're not currently forecasting much improvement in communications infrastructure revenues in our second quarter, our customers in many geographies are now beginning to signal that we should expect the resumption of growth in the second half of this year. The consumer end market decreased 21% sequentially, a little bit more than our seasonal expectations, but also due in part to customer production limitations caused by the floods in Thailand, which limited our customers ordering patterns for many of our products. We're currently forecasting some growth in consumer sales in the second quarter, in line with what we normally see seasonally from first to second quarter.  So I think, really, the summary comment with few exceptions is the 2 things that seem to play out during the first quarter were inventory reductions at most of our customers and delays to long-term capital expenditures at many of our customers. And I think for the most part, we now believe that both of these trends seemed to have run their course, at least for ADI, by the end of December. On a regional basis, only North America experienced any sequential revenue increase in Q1. And even in North America, the growth rate was very modest. It was only up about 1% or so. And that was the result of strength in automotive and the wired communications markets in the U.S.  Revenue in Japan declined by 23% due to consumer inventory seasonality and also the supply-chain limitations that I mentioned earlier.  Revenues from Europe decreased 12% as increases on automotive sales were more than offset by declines in industrial and communications revenues.  Revenues in China decreased 11%, as declines across the industrial end market overshadowed good growth in other markets.  This RoW, or rest of world, decline of 6% was largely due to reductions in consumer revenue.  So now Dave will take you through some of the details of the first quarter financial results, and I'll come back after Dave's comments and talk a little bit more about the outlook. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, first quarter revenue declined 9.5% sequentially and 11% year-over-year to $648 million. Our gross margin was 63.2% in the first quarter. This was down from the 64.3% we reported in Q4, primarily as a result of our decision to decrease factory utilization.  Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in control with virtually 100% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 6 weeks and in 99% within 4 weeks. Operating expenses for the first quarter were approximately flat from the prior quarter at $226.1 million, a great result given an extra week of expenses. Holiday shutdowns and tight control of discretionary items helped keep expenses in check.  Operating profits for the fourth quarter were $183 million or 28.3% of sales compared to 32.9% of sales in the prior quarter. Operating profits were down both in dollar and percentage terms as a result of the lower revenue and reduced factory absorption in the first quarter. Other expense was $3 million in the first quarter compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense.  Our tax rate for the first quarter was 22.6%, in line with expectations we communicated for our 22% rate in fiscal 2012. We expect our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, to be approximately 21.5% for the remainder of fiscal 2012.  Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 in the first quarter was slightly lower than the midpoint of our guidance, as tight control of operating expenses provided some relief against lower revenue on gross margins. Cash flow in the first quarter continued to be strong. We generated 33% of our revenue or $215 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $25 million, resulting in free cash flow of $190 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter.  Our accounts receivable balance decreased from the prior quarter by $46 million due to lower sales, and our days sales outstanding increased by 2 days from the prior quarter to 46 days.  Inventory was carefully managed and increased by only $2 million or less than 1% despite lower sales. Inventory at distribution also declined by approximately 7% and is at the lowest point since 2010. During the first quarter, we repurchased $78 million of our stock, and we received $49 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We also distributed $74 million in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash balance at the end of the first quarter was approximately $3.7 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion is available domestically. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding.  On February 21, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, up from $0.25 last quarter, which will be paid on March 28, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of about 3%. This significant dividend increase represents our strategy to improve returns to our shareholders and also our confidence in our continuing ability to generate significant free cash flow in the future. In summary, our operating model includes significant variable costs that have helped ADI achieve record-high margins during the upturns in recent industry cycles, and equally as important, during the inevitable downturns. Our results in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of our model as tight expense control, variable compensation and a highly responsive manufacturing infrastructure have ADI well positioned for the emerging recovery.  At current operating margin levels, we have significant operating leverage as sales increase, and we begin to reload our factories, while keeping very tight control of operating expenses. And so now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry to discuss recovery in terms of ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Well, thanks, Dave. Although we are certainly in a challenging business environment, we do see improvement on the horizon. We now believe that our inventory levels at both OEM customers and distributors are below consumption rates, and we're pleased to report that our order rates have improved and increased significantly over the last 6 weeks.  For the second quarter of 2012, we believe revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $675 million or up 1% to 4% sequentially. Considering now we're going from a 14-week quarter to a more normal 13-week quarter in Q2, this sequential revenue growth at these levels is significantly higher on an apples-to-apples basis. We're planning for higher sales and a higher mix of industrial products, which leads us to our gross margin plan of somewhere between 64% and 64.5% for the second quarter.  While utilization will increase in Q2 compared to Q1, it's expected to still remain below 70%, which indicates that we still have significant remaining gross margin leverage as sales improve in future quarters and as utilization expands.  We anticipate that operating expenses will remain flat in Q2 to Q1 levels and also to Q4 2011 levels at about $226 million. Given that the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, as Dave mentioned, we will continue to aggressively monitor and control our expenses in Q2 and for the balance of the year.  Based on these estimates that are excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.53 in our second quarter. So in summary, the fundamentals of our business remained strong during this cycle. And as growth returns, we believe our customer relationships, our technology portfolio, our better market focus, our terrific service levels and our financial model will all contribute to higher profitability and we believe, increasing shareholder returns. Maria Tagliaferro Great. Thank you very much, Jerry. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of James Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I guess first question, Jerry, can you give us some sort of idea of how much you think we can grow revenues here just from customers kind of going back to consuming at their own shipment levels? So in other words, if production and consumption levels kind of come back in line, how much can we grow? And then beyond that we're going to need sales growth, how much do you think, just kind of catching back up, can you give us some growth here? Jerald G. Fishman Well that's a very complicated question to answer, so I can only really speak qualitatively about that. One way to think about it, I think, Jim, is that if you look at our industrial revenues from the peak of where they were before the cycle sort of collapsed to where last quarter wound up, our industrial revenues are down 20-plus percent. If you look at our customers' results in the industrial business, none of our customers' results are down anything like that. In fact, many of our larger industrial customers particularly -- well, customers in the United States and Europe and China, we look and their industrial revenues are up. So there's been a pretty significant inventory reduction at our customers. When you couple that with their most recent outlooks -- and after I finish, I'll turn it over to Vince who just came back from another long week on the road talking to a lot of those customers, I think most of our customers are really not pessimistic about the next couple of quarters. I'd say they are not jumping off the tables and saying that everything is great, but they're -- so they expect to get some growth and some little sooner, some a little later. I think the early adapters in this business to what's happened will be the industrial business, but I think soon after, it could be followed by the communications business. So it's really very hard to put a crisp number on it, but some of the largest customers have had enormous inventory reductions, well beyond what would be indicated by any potential slowdown on their sales. So I think there's a reasonable amount of just snapback, just to get back to normal consumption levels. But Vince, you have some comment? Vincent T. Roche Yes. Just a couple of points for color here. I think it's true to say that the first -- or let's say, the second and third quarters of the year just gone -- customers were trying to get ahead of the supply issues and a lot of over-inventorying was done. I think the second half of the year was very much dominated by the debt crisis in Europe to a large extent, a lot of our business is done in Europe with the industrial customer base, particularly in the areas of automation. I think the confidence is generally good with our customers out there that this is going to be a pretty good year, maybe modest growth. But I think also some customers still believe that their burning off inventory, and it will take probably another couple of months to get the inventory out of the pipe. But I think certainly second and third quarters, we're expecting to see some positive movements in terms of industrial customers based on their confidence and certainly the order rates that we're seeing from them. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division That's terrific. If I'm allowed a follow-up I guess I would ask how much margin expansion should we see for every, say, $50 million of incremental revenue growth from here, assuming mix stays the same with industrial being a little bit higher of a percentage than it was at times in the past? David A. Zinsner This is gross margins you're asking? James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Correct. David A. Zinsner Well I know, I mean we're obviously -- first off, I think the gross margin, if this is indeed the trough, we're pretty stellar relative to previous troughs. In fact, I think, now our previous troughs -- our previous peaks are like much our current troughs. So we've done a lot to fundamentally improve the gross margins from where we were, say, a few years ago. Going forward, clearly I think the utilization were down to -- a lot of this is going to be driven off utilization -- were down below 70% when we were at our peak at 67%, a little over 67%. We were -- our utilization was up past 80%. So really the fundamental driver in getting the margins up, I think, will mostly be a function of getting that utilization up. And as Jerry said, we're still even next quarter operating at relatively low utilization, and I think our expectation is that we'll ramp back into the levels that we saw in prior periods where the margins were up into the high 60s. Jerald G. Fishman Jim, the other comment I'd make is that we're working hard to really manage the inventory very carefully here. And we want to make sure that we have enough so -- because in these kind of cycles, you can get a very quick snapback or changing customer sentiment, and everybody starts loading you up again. So you got to be careful that you don't see both ends of the seesaw here. So we're trying to keep the inventory levels at reasonable levels, so that: number one, we'll get expansion on the gross margins when we really do load the factories, but also that when customers do decide to make changes, and history shows they make those changes very quickly that we can be as responsive in this cycle as we were in the last cycle. We still think that's the best policy for ADI. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Just a little bit, maybe more on the gross margin question. So Dave, could you quantify what your utilizations were in the January quarter? And is the full utilization rate for you guys north of 80%? And did you have any one-time kind of markdowns or inventory effects impacting gross margins for your last quarter? David A. Zinsner Okay. So utilization in the first quarter was 67%. Like Jerry said, we're expecting it to be north of that, but below 70%. So hard to pick the exact point, but somewhere between 67% and 70%, we're expecting utilization. We did have a little bit of a inventory write-down more so than we normally have in the first quarter. It probably was -- contributed about 50 basis points of the decline in gross margins, certainly will help us because we don't think that's going to repeat again in the second quarter. As far as maximum utilization goes, I guess, theoretically, if you get to a 100, rarely do you get to that level, so something in the high 80s probably, or 90% is probably where we'd like to -- where we feel comfortable and think we can keep our lead times to the place we want to keep them. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, we've operated our manufacturing facilities very well at 90% utilization. And then just by adding small amounts of incremental capital, we can get the overall capacity up quite quickly. So 90% is quite comfortable for us. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay, great. And then on the inventory question, it sounds like some areas from your perspective, if I heard it correctly, are getting lean, in some areas, there are still some or what your customers are communicating to you as they're digesting inventory. What are the areas that still seem like they're still in the process of burning down inventory? Vincent T. Roche I think particularly in the small customer base, which is largely industrial and some of the larger industrial customers themselves, but I think it's very much industrial and possibly health care as well. Jerald G. Fishman But all the signals we're getting is, that's really winding down. So we're seeing -- when the inflection point on the bookings occurs broadly as we've seen, that's usually an indication that there's still might be a little inventory out there in couple of the customers, some of these end markets as Vince mentioned. But that's going to not affect the results nearly to the extent that it has affected them over the last 3 quarters. So I think we're all -- even if they are still burning off a little inventory, the net results that we can achieve is quite a bit better than where they were, where the mentality 6 to 9 months ago was just get inventory down as fast as you possibly can. We had many of our largest customers that went through a quarter or 2 and didn't order anything because they just didn't want any more inventory. And that really accelerated what we got into November and part of December when they were facing year end. We monitor our customers' inventory in aggregate pretty carefully. And when you look at the inventory levels of some of our large industrial customers are carrying in aggregate, this doesn't necessarily make a comment about ADI products specifically. It's quite, quite lean right now. So there might be some more to go. It might take another month or 2 in some of the accounts, but I believe and what we're seeing in the order rates is most of that is behind us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of from Tristan Gerra from Robert Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Could you talk about the segments this year you think are for the best growth opportunities? And also on a geographic basis, do you expect to catch up in Japan over the next couple of quarters as the supply chain comes back? Jerald G. Fishman I didn't get the first part of your question, could you repeat that? Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division The first part of the question was just to talk about some of the segments that you think are for the best growth opportunities for ADI this year? Any color by end market? Jerald G. Fishman Sure, I think was that the question... Vincent T. Roche Sure. I think in general, yes. So your question is the best growth opportunities across the globe. So clearly automotive has been a standard growth contributor to the company over the last couple of years, and I expect that will continue this year and for the next few years at least anyways. Demand is very strong in all the geographic markets. And particularly the America, we saw strong growth in the quarter just gone. In fact, I read a statistic in the last couple of days that the average age of a car now in America is over 10 years, so there's a replenishment cycle going on there very, very clearly. And we're expecting in Japan and China as well growth in the region of 9% to 12% for this year. There's, again -- in China, there's a lot of demand for mid- to high-end cars that we're very prevalent in supplying products to. And Japan as well there's a very, very strong replacement activity going on there. So I think automotive will be strong. Communications infrastructure, I believe, in the second half of the year as we start to see the calendar year, as we start to see the continued data explosion and the need to put hardware in places. As Jerry said earlier, there's been kind of an optimization cycle in the past quarter or 2, but the operators who have the cash are going to have to start putting hardware into place over the next 2, 3 quarters. So I think we'll see some decent growth there. And industrial, as I said, it could be modest but at least we expect some growth during the remainder of this year. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay. And then a quick one could you give us the breakdown of your communication revenues? Vincent T. Roche Well it's roughly -- 2/3 of the revenue comes from the wireless infrastructure sector and 1/3 from the wired infrastructure sector. And wired is really the composite of optical and cable infrastructure and some enterprise business. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Crdit Suisse. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division Yes. Quickly, Jerry, the first question I have is just relative to the January quarter. You guys came in at a little bit late of the low end of guidance. Was that all the Thailand? And the reason why I ask is a lot of chip companies actually saw some strength in the December, beginning of January. So I'm just kind of curious as to why you guys came in at the low end of your guidance for the January quarter. And then I have a follow-up. Jerald G. Fishman Well I mean, it's hard to say what other people did one way or the other. We weren't even around the last 2 weeks in December. We had most of our factories closed and not much of our sales guys out there. But we began to see the increase in very early January, starting with the first week in January that we came back, and we've seen that to be relatively strong since then. So it's very hard for us to say why somebody's orders were stronger one week versus another. It's hard to get into that level of granularity. I'm just happy to see that our orders began to pick up in early January and it has continued strong into mid-February. That's the best I can tell you. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division A follow-up, just going back to the utilization, below 70% for both the Jan and the April quarter, can you do -- can you help us, remind -- for every 100 basis point improvement in utilization, what that might mean for gross margin? And I guess given the strong mix of industrial in the April quarter, does mix come into a play that perhaps dampen cyclical leverage beyond April? David A. Zinsner Well clearly the second quarter will have a strong industrial component to it. And that will help gross margins from a mix perspective. But we think or we're assuming that industrial was at a low point in the first quarter and that we will see recovery beyond the second quarter. So my guess is mix is not a headwind going forward, if we're right that we're in the early stages of a recovery. But I guess maybe the best way to describe the utilization to gross margin ratio is, back when we were operating in the 67% gross margins, we were running kind of high 70s to 80% utilization. Jerald G. Fishman It's not a strictly linear relationship of x number basis points for each point of utilization. It just -- does not the way the factories are run, that's not the way the costs are generated. But I think Dave's comment is illustrative of the kind of gross margin leverage that's out there as utilization improves. But we can't model it linearly for you. Operator Next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division The first question is just a follow-up on the communications business. Vincent, can you talk about the types of projects that you're hearing about for the back half of the year? Are those 3G projects? Or are those LTE projects? And the color that you're getting, can you provide some insight on whether that's based on OEMs in particular geographies, or on the projects in particular geographies? Or is it more broad-based? Vincent T. Roche Well I think all of the major players in the wireless space are attacking the market with a broad range of technologies. Some are more heavily focused on 4G, some of them got out of the starting blocks earlier on the 4G, but I think everybody has some level of offering across 4G, 3G and even 2G. In India today, we still see deployment of 2G. But my sense is that this year or next year, we're going to see largely a move out of 2G into 3G, and I think most of our sales over the next 3 or 4 years will be dominated by 3G and particularly 4G. I think it's true to say that in the more developed economies, the deployment is really 4G at this point in time. It's to get the data into place that people need to be able to move all these massive quantities of mobile video and high-bandwidth data. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And then switching gears and a question for Dave. Dave, real nice increase on the dividend, 12%, $0.30 a share. As we think about the dividend generative capacity of the firm and the balance that you want to strike as you think about the right level of payout and the cash that's available in the U.S. to fund that dividend, how do we think about an upper control in that forward, what the dividend payout might be as we think about ADI's business? David A. Zinsner How do we think about what? Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division The upper control limit. Is there a free cash flow payout that you wouldn't want to go over? Or what are some of the parameters that you're looking, as you think about what the potential payout is on your dividend? David A. Zinsner Well I mean the issue with using payout ratios on cash flow is every quarter it can be up and down, depending if you have onetime tax payment, things like that. So generally historically I think -- someone mentioned that we've been paying -- we've paid out around 40% of our net income in the form of dividends, and what we'd like to see is that number to be higher. We don't have a rule of thumb for every quarter, but we're trying to push the dividend to be more and more compelling to shareholders, return more and more of our cash flow to shareholders. And that's really the way we think about it versus some sort of scientific ratio that we apply. We think that investors, at least the ones we've talked to particularly over the last, say, 6 months has been really interested in dividends as a means of returning cash to shareholders vis--vis buyback. So we've taken the approach to really put a little bit more emphasis on the dividend. Operator Next question comes from the line of Uche Orji from UBS. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Jerry, can I just ask you a few subsegment questions? So my first question is on the infrastructure area. You did mention some of the events last year that led to a slowdown in basically the wireless infrastructure. As you go in through this year and you talk to your customers, what is the expectation for recovery there, particularly in North America and in China. Is there any comment on wireless infrastructure will be helpful. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Because of the situation in the U.S., there would be the whole situation surrounding AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, there was obviously a great lull in procurement of equipment or deployment of equipment and procurement of products. But in my sense is some point in this -- in the next number of months, we're going to see, as I mentioned earlier, some level of deployment of hardware because there just aren't enough base stations deployed, particularly in America and Europe to have -- handle the data requirements that are in place. Now our -- the operators and our customers have been trying to optimize the equipment that's already there through pretty much software techniques, just to get the capacity to where it needed to be. But I think we're going to see a pretty strong deployment of new hardware, particularly in Europe and the America in the area of 4G in the second, third, fourth quarter of this year. But I think in Europe and America, we're pretty much 4G; Japan, 4G; and in China to be a mixture of 2, 3 and 4G. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division In terms of the leverage you have as we go into -- as we deploy 4G, I know that some of that component suppliers will have higher leverage. Do you think as we go into 4G -- there are 2 questions here, one is how much more leverage do you think you have within that segment? And also in terms of the base of that over 3G, I mean I'm just trying to see if there's any way to understand how ADI could leverage this growth beyond just about that in the 4G deployment. I'm not sure if that's any more incremental leverage for you. Vincent T. Roche SO I think it's actually very good for ADI. The more complex the problem becomes, and the problem does become more complex in terms of delivering performance when you get to 4G levels. That's good for ADI. We participate in pushing the performance envelope in all of these radio systems across the globe with all the major players. So the move into 4G is very, very good for ADI. And of course it won't stop there either. There will be more generations coming on top of that in the years ahead. So in terms of being able to put a specific quantity in there in terms of leverage, all I can tell you is that the content increases for ADI in terms of ASP per system, the higher level of the system, and that is certainly true in terms of 4G from 3G, for example. Jerald G. Fishman Well I think the other part of it is that not only does that require higher performance components, as Vince said, but we have a much wider spectrum of products that we supply in newer systems. We've talked previously about our RF portfolio, which I think in the early generations of wireless infrastructure was quite minimal, but in the more recent and most advanced deployments, our RF products are very, very important, and very often the differentiator in the system that differentiates our product offerings from our competitors. We also have many other new products like clocks and other types of things that go around converters that we never had, really, in the early 2, and in some cases, 3G deployments. So I think that we're getting the benefit of number one, that you need higher performance components; number two, in many of the new systems, there are more cards per box than in the older systems; and thirdly, the product offering is much broader in the newer systems than it was in the older systems. So the combination of all those 3 things happening simultaneously does give us a lot of leverage on the upside as newer systems get deployed. Vincent T. Roche There are 2 dimensions to the products that we supply to these systems. We have, of course, the data path products that allow the performance, the speed and the bandwidth performance requirements to be realized. But also there are control and observation circuits that are required that become more and more sophisticated as the standards continue to increase in performance levels. So it's good on both sides of that -- on both those dimensions for ADI, both in terms of the data stream, but also the sophistication of the components required to keep these systems stable and secure. Jerald G. Fishman I would just make one final comment on that. That when we visit all the large infrastructure accounts, we are one of very, very few competitors that can offer the breadth of products they really want. And as you look forward, the deepness of the relationship that's going to be required between the suppliers, in this case, like ADI and the manufacturers, who well-known in this business is getting to be much, much tighter every year. And the strategic rationale of buying one part from one vendor and another part from another vendor and picking the rest of the catalog in that business, I think is more indicative of what it's been than what it's going to be in the future. So I think that the deepness in the strategic engagements that are required to really penetrate new applications in that business is much, much greater than it's been. And in that sense, the breadth of the portfolio, the reputation of the vendor, the share that the current vendor has, the build of materials, the technology roadmaps in terms of not only single products but very integrated products that integrate analog technology and RF technology and a bunch of other things on either the same chip or the same package is going to be a very important differentiator going forward. And In that sense, we think that's one of ADI's long-term, very significant competitive advantages. Operator The next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays Capital. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division I guess first question, I was hoping to maybe get some color on whether you saw any changes in order patterns post-Chinese New Year, whether any business performed better or worse. Would love to hear color on that. Jerald G. Fishman I don't think so. I think what we typically see is business was very good for quite a while. The Chinese New Year came and businesses in Asia weakened for a week, and then it came back very strongly the week after. So I don't think we saw any trends in the Chinese New Year that are not very typical to what we have seen normally. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, I was hoping maybe could talk a little bit about some of the recent acquisitions, Lyric, AudioAsics, et cetera. Any contribution there that's noteworthy that we should be thinking about in terms of future growth? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think some of the -- the second one you mentioned has been long ago integrated and cataloged as an important part of our product offering. Lyric is much more of a longer-term play where we really believe that the kind of technology they have really enables performance that without that type of technology, it just isn't possible on many, many dimensions that are very critical in signal processing. We're just now beginning to embed that type of technology in our products. We have a couple of areas that we picked out where we think it's the most relevant. So I think as we get out toward the end this year and into 2013, we will begin to see Lyric technology deployed in a wide number of ADI products that will really -- that technology will really make a huge difference in power [ph] participation and other characteristic signs that people really care about. So the proof is in the pudding, and it's always hard to predict exact quantitative numbers long in advance. But everything we've seen so far substantiates the value of that technology ultimately to Analog Devices and our customers. Operator The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie Jerry, you mentioned that you'd expect a quick snapback on the industrial side. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the piece of how that would look. I mean is it you get the bulk of that recovery in one quarter? Or will it take at least over a couple of quarters? Jerald G. Fishman I think it will be probably, if history is a good example, it will be a gradual recovery, eventually it gets to the point where people's psyche changes a little bit and they start saying, \"Oh my God, there's not enough supply out there.\" Then we can see more rapid acceleration. But at least from the data that we're getting from the customers and Vince, as I mentioned, just visited a bunch of our large industrial customers in the last week or 2. I think what we're expecting or at least what we're planning for is a gradual recovery in our industrial businesses as we've seen in many other cycles. Vince, do you have anything else to... Vincent T. Roche I think just to add a little more color to what Jerry said, we have -- we characterize the industrial sector across the areas that have automation, energy instrumentation and aero. And we've seen since this time last year, pretty much all those subsegments are down just about the same level from the peak. The indications are that they're all going to pick up. As Jerry said, they are down roughly about 25% over the past year. Now we're expecting that the recovery will be fairly gradual, and I would say in the next 2 or 3 quarters we'll see the recovery gather steam. Jerald G. Fishman Of course Vince is just saying that because he wants me to raise his sales plan. Our experience is that is typically what happens. Jonathan Smigie Right. And my follow-up, with regard to the telecom recovery you're talking about for the second half, is there a particular geography you'd expect to see a sharper or more meaningful recovery? Jerald G. Fishman I don't know. I mean my own sense, I'd be curious to hear Vince's views on that. It will come up where it went down the most first because some of that recovery is just going to be the end of the inventory reduction. I think longer term, everyone can make their own prediction about which economies are going to grow faster, what's going to happen in Europe, what's going to happen in the U.S. as the election gets closer, what's going to happen in China in terms of government policy. So there's a lot of unknowns about what the macro issues are going to be in each of the regions. But I think right now, what we expect is that the places that have done -- have had the most significant reductions will have the most significant increases at least in the short term. Vince? Vincent T. Roche Yes. So the industrial business that we've talked about a lot is very intertwined in Europe and America, in particular. Those 2 regions have seen the sharpest declines over the last few quarters, and they are the regions that I would expect to see improve, see the benefit of the improvement over the next number of quarters most compared to the others. Jerald G. Fishman I think just to try to quantify that just a little bit. If you go back to the fourth quarter, our peak quarter, in industrial revenues, which was about a year or 15 months ago, we were doing -- we did $350 million in the industrial area that quarter. Last quarter, we did below $290 million. In a business with probably 10,000 or more different customers in virtually every geography in the world, that's a massive decline in the short period of time. I mean that's a market that tends to move at glacial speeds. So that just gives you a sense of what it is that is possible for us over the next couple of quarters. But we'll just have to wait and see how that happens. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I had just a quick one first on, I guess, the effect of the 14th week. So as I recall from last quarter, you'd suggested that holiday shutdowns and I guess the Asia holidays as well would mitigate or eliminate any potential upside from that 14th week, but you don't seem to be suggesting that now when you're giving color on the seasonal growth embedded in your guidance. Can you give us some feeling for how much additional revenue in this quarter that you just reported that 14th week actually provided, so we can get some better feeling for what the apples-to-apples seasonal growth comparison ought to be? Jerald G. Fishman I mean it's purely a guess is what I'd have to say. We believed that probably we lost at least a week to maybe 1.5 weeks of revenue last quarter due to the holidays. Some people think it's 2. Some people think it's this. I mean there are a lot of different analyses of that. Of course it's very hard to be specific about that. But I'd say if you took a number of 1.5 week or something, that probably wouldn't be a bad number. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division But wouldn't you usually have that same loss of revenue in this quarter every single year? So that would be normal wouldn't it? Jerald G. Fishman Oh no. Yes, partially that's absolutely true. But when you have a year where the economy is really in the tank and virtually every company that we sold to, including us, it was closed for at least a week and maybe, in Analog's case, 2 weeks, and many of our customers. That tends to be exacerbated from what would normally be people think 3 extra days over Christmas off. So I think when times are good, we see periods where we get through that with almost no change in the Christmas period. And when times are bad, we get a whopping big change. So I think this was more in the latter category than the former. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Okay. And for my follow-up, I want to touch a little bit on this, I guess, peak-to-trough decline in industrial revenue. So there, you're right they're down 20-plus percent from the peak. But is it fair to say that, that peak itself was potentially elevated as the customers were probably overbuilding inventories? Do you have any sort of feeling for how elevated it might have been and like -- how far below are you? What would tend to be sort of a normalized level of typical inventories? What would that decline be if it was off of a normalized level? Jerald G. Fishman You're asking very challenging questions that we really don't have... Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I do try. Jerald G. Fishman I know you do, and you can see. I mean it's very hard because when we were shipping at those levels and we went to the customers and went to our sales folks, and said, \"Boy, this looks pretty overheated. Is this really sustainable? And what's going to happen when the inventories rebalance?\" And we got a lot of comments that was very specific with the consumer, customers and I'd say the communications customers that this one probably took 10 million too much, this one took 20 million too much. And we did see a long lineup in the lobby of those kind of customers that were desperate for products then. We didn't see that much in the industrial area, because the customers tend to be smaller and more diversified. So in the communications area, it's a little easier to try and be quantitative about that than in the industrial area, but I don't know. If you say I did 350, how much could that be? It could be $10 million, it could be $20 million, I don't know. It could be $5 million. I don't think it's more than $20 million. But I don't know. I just don't know. When there's too many customers, too many different ordering patterns to be real specific about it. Vincent T. Roche Yes. I think a couple of things that might have helped us through the upswing, through the cycle. I think our lead times were very healthy as the tsunami crisis hit last year, and we've kept our lead times very healthy as a company over the last 2.5 years. And also, we paid very close attention to the demand rates as per the end customer rather than factoring in the channel demand. So I think those 2 things helped us to some extent manage both the upswing and the downswing. Jerald G. Fishman I think the other thing that we look at, Stacy, a little bit to try to smooth this out as we look at what the growth rate of the industrial business has been over the last couple of years on the average, because this owing supply or demand issues on either side of that end. The kind of numbers that we're planning for our industrial business are commensurate with the industrial business that's grown about 8% to 10% a year. Now I think '11 was a little bit overheated. The year before was a little bit underheated. But the sequential numbers are harder to try to predict because of all the things you're saying that what's the long-term growth rate of that business, and I think with the success we're having in some segments of the industrial business, which are growing at quite strong rates. We think long term that's a good grower for us. And it's going to grow at a rate that is higher than most people believed and that we even believed when we looked at it 3 years ago on the average. Years will be better; years will be worse, but the question you're getting out of trying to predict, how much industrial revenues you're going to get based on the bounce back is just -- we just don't know enough to be quantitative about that. I mean there's something there, I just can't pin point exactly what it is. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just a quick clarification. If we take out the 14, the 13-week transition, did you guys feel like demand or your revenue this quarter is back to normal seasonality? Jerald G. Fishman I don't know. I don't know what normal is in this world any more frankly, but I think what we're -- the guidance that -- the range of guidance that we put out is indicative of the order rates that we're now achieving. That's the best I can say. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division That's fair. And then in terms of the increase, Jerry, do you think that it's all inventory replenishment or all demand improving or a little bit of both? Jerald G. Fishman Well your guess on that is probably as good, if not better, than mine. I think there's certainly some inventory replenishment. As Vince said earlier, many of the large industrial customers are indicating that they're planning to grow this year. And so I think there's probably some of that in there. It's probably a combination of those 2, the ratio between those 2, I just don't know. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Okay. And then one last clarification, if I may. On the reported quarter, the reason you guys came in at the low end of guidance, was that because consumer and/or industrial was a little bit lower than you thought? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think November and December were worse than we thought at the outset. And then we were worried going into January that we'd miss the lower end of the guidance. I think we had some people around that believed that was the case going into the Christmas period. But January was a better month, and you could really see the inflection point in the order as soon as we came back. So that was very encouraging. And the fact that it stayed strong in the early part or the first couple of weeks in February, which we've now seen is encouraging to us and we're hopeful that continues. Maria Tagliaferro Great. Well we just came up on the 6:00 hour, and unfortunately we have quite a few people still in the queue. So I'm going to ask folks to give us a call to the Investor Relations line. And we'll set up a scheduled time, and get back to you today this evening. The number there is  461-3282. And we have a record of who's still on the queue, and we'll be sure to reach out to you.  So thanks again for joining us on today's call. Just for your information, our call for the second quarter's financial results is scheduled for May 22, 2012, beginning at 5:00 p.m. The release will be out at 4:00. Thanks very much for joining us.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Ms. Kohl you may begin your conference. Mindy Kohl Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Mindy Kohl, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you haven't yet seen our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 release, you can access it by visiting our website at www.analog.com and clicking on the headline in the News section of our homepage. This conference call is also being webcast live. From analog.com, select Investor Relations and follow the instructions shown next to the microphone icon.  A recording of this conference call will be available today, within about 2 hours of this call's completion, and will remain available via telephone playback for one week. This webcast will also be archived at our IR website. Participating in today's call are Jerry Fishman, President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; Robbie McAdams, Vice President of Core Products and technologies; and Vincent Roche, Vice President of Strategic Market Segments and Worldwide Sales.  During the first part of the call, Jerry and Dave will present our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results, as well as our short-term outlook. The remainder of the time will be devoted to answering questions from our analysts and investor participants. During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain nonrecurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website.  In addition, we have updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary of P&amp;Ls for continuing operations, as well as historical quarterly and annual information for revenue from continuing operations by end markets and product type. Please note that effective Q4, we changed the revenue classifications of our handset and computer businesses.  Our handset revenues, previously included in communications, has been moved to consumer, which is aligned with how this business is managed internally. As a result, our communications revenue category now consists solely of comms infrastructure, which is also aligned with our internal management of this business.  In addition, we folded our computer business, too small to be broken out on its own, into consumer, which it most resembled in terms of market dynamics, products and in some cases, customer.  On our latest web schedules we restated the last 12 fiscal quarters to reflect these changes. Next, I'd ask you to please note that the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will have some time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is November 21, 2011. With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald G. Fishman Well, good afternoon and thanks for joining us on today's call. As you read in this afternoon's earnings release, ADI's revenues for Q2 were about $716 million, which was down 6% sequentially, and 7% year-over-year, and at the low end of the guidance that we've provided to you last quarter. Our sequential revenue decrease was primarily the result of declines in industrial and communications sector revenues.  Our Q4 revenues in automotive increased sequentially, and consumer revenues were seasonally stronger than in Q3. For the year, our total revenues increased 8.4% to just about $3 billion. Although our full year revenue was right on our plan for our fiscal 2011, the quarter-to-quarter volatility was very pronounced, mostly as a result of industry supply imbalances that dominated the landscape through much of the year, along with European sovereign debt and U.S. deficit concerns that have been more recently concerns in the market, and have created industry-wide uncertainty in virtually every geography.  Perceived supply disruptions early in the year, quickly turned into excess inventory, at customers and distributors in the second half of the year. As a result, early in the year order rates for our products were well above consumption rates, and in the second half of the year, order rates appeared to be well below consumption rates. Well after many years in this business we see it's very unusual for order rates to very closely match consumption in any particular period. 2011 was extreme, in that excess demand turned into excess supply so quickly.  Despite the volatility during 2011, ADI had a very good year in aggregate. As I mentioned earlier, revenues grew in line with our long-term model, and reached just about $3 billion for the first time in our history. Gross margin increased once again to 66.4% for the year, and operating expenses grew only 2% on an 8.4% sales increase. As a result, our non-GAAP diluted earnings grew to $2.72, which is a 15% increase from the prior year.  We also generated $778 million or 26% of sales in free cash flow. While in the short-term our revenue is mostly outside our control, we believe we did a very credible job reacting to the environment, and getting the upside in 2011 when it was available and also protecting the downside when market conditions turned somewhat negative.  As the macroeconomic environment deteriorated over the last 2 quarters, we at ADI reacted very quickly, we lowered production rates to minimize inventory, and all discretionary spending in the company. Our variable compensation levels also declined, as they were designed to do, to modulate profit volatility. But of course, the real question that's on everybody's mind is where are we in the cycle. As we know here at ADI, downturns caused by inventory imbalances rarely last more than 2 to 3 quarters. So by that measure, most of the revenue decline caused by inventory reductions should be completed in our current quarter or our first fiscal quarter.  Most of the revenue declines that have occurred in the industrial and communications markets, which represent about 2/3 of our revenue, and are very closely aligned with overall capital spending worldwide. Our customers in those markets have reduced their expectations somewhat for 2012, but in general are still expecting 2012 to be a growth year over 2011. In fact, our 2012 forecast from our largest customers in these markets currently reflect that what I would call guarded optimism.  But right now, the world continues to be a very uncertain place in every region of the world and the range of possible outcomes for the year as a whole is very wide. So as we construct our operating plans for 2012, which has began a few weeks ago, we're guided by the following principles: number one, we are in a growth business, which should provide a rate of growth well ahead of that growth rate of the semiconductor market, by virtue of the fact that we're well-positioned in the fastest growth segments of the semiconductor market, with highly differentiated products that really do create real value for our customers; number 2, we're in a business that provides the opportunity to earn exceptional margins as a result of this significant value that we do provide to our customers.  For ADI, it's really all about execution against our objectives more so than the opportunity that's available to us, which even in bad times remains considerable in size. Number 3: we believe that we're spending an adequate amount of money on R&amp;D to achieve our growth goals. As result, our primary focus is on resource allocation. As we have discussed previously, we will continue to reevaluate and to optimize our product in market portfolio to ensure that we're investing the right amount of resource in the right products and in the right markets.  While this is a very deliberative process, we have in the past and we will continue to change the allocation of resources, when the market opportunity or the competitive dynamics in any particular market or product segment changes drastically. Number 4: ADI will continue to focus on maintaining and evolving our flexible supply chain to keep our lead times very short and responsive to customers' needs, and to continue to provide industry-leading quality levels to our customers. Number 5: we will keep a significant amount of our costs as variable given all the industry volatility that keeps coming at us year after year. And lastly, number 6, we should continue to generate very significant free cash flow, which provides us with the opportunity to enhance shareholder returns, with increasing dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks.  So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave, who will take you through some of the details of our fourth quarter and our full year results, and I'll make some additional comments regarding what's going on in some of the market segments, and also our short-term outlooks, after Dave completes his remarks. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, fourth quarter revenue declined 6% sequentially, and 7% year-over-year to $716 million. And for the year, we grew revenue 8.4% to $3 billion. Our gross margin was 64.3% in the fourth quarter, this was down from 67.2% we reported in the third quarter due to a greater mix of consumer and automotive versus industrial revenue, and the impact of lower factory utilization to 73%, down from 78% last quarter.  This enabled us to bring down inventory levels, both on our balance sheet as well as the balance sheet of our distributors. Inventory on our balance sheet declined by 1% and was down in days from 110 days to 105 days. Inventory at distribution decreased by 11%, and was down below the typical 8 weeks that distributors carry. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, including $2.2 million of restructuring charges, declined by $6 million or 2% from the prior quarter, to $225 million, primarily, as a result of lower variable compensation cost.  As you know, the variability of our operating expenses enables us to react quickly in times when revenue is lower. In addition, we continue the discretionary cost controls we implemented at the end of the third quarter, which also helped reduce expenses this quarter. We plan to continue to carefully manage expenses in our first quarter. Operating profits for the fourth quarter were $235 million or 32.9% of sales compared to 36.8% of sales in the prior quarter.  Operating profits were down both in dollar and percentage terms as a result of the lower revenue and reduced factory absorption in the fourth quarter. Other expenses of $4 million in the fourth quarter was flat to Q3, and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.6%. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% in fiscal 2012, which is up from 2011, as result of potentially losing the R&amp;D tax credit.  If Congress extends the tax credit, our tax rate will likely be approximately 21.5%. Diluted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.60 compared to $0.71 in the prior quarter, and $0.73 in the same period a year ago. For the year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.72, a 15% increase from the prior year. In addition to the solid profitability, we maintained very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter, generating 32% of our revenue or $230 million in operating cash flow.  Capital expenditures were $26 million, resulting in free cash flow of $204 million or 28% of revenue for the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares or $83 million worth of ADI stock, and distributed $75 million in dividends to our shareholders. At current stock prices, our dividend yield is 2.8%. For the full year, we repurchased 9 million shares or $330 million worth of ADI stock, and distributed $282 million in dividends.  Since the inception of the stock repurchase plan and the dividend program beginning in fiscal 2004, ADI has paid out almost $6 billion in dividends and stock buyback, demonstrating our strong commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. On November 18, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on December 21, 2011, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2.  We closed the year with $3.6 billion in cash, of which $1.2 billion or 33% is in the U.S. Net cash, excluding approximately $900 million in debt, was $2.7 billion at the end of the year. Our accounts receivable balance decreased from the prior quarter by 7% due to lower sales and our days sales outstanding decreased by one day from the prior quarter to 44 days. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter, and are in good control with 100% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 6 weeks and 99% within 4 weeks.  In summary, 2011 was an excellent year across multiple dimensions as Jerry described earlier. Although the fourth quarter was certainly weaker than other quarters within the year, we reacted by controlling that which was within our control, namely inventory builds and operating expenses, to ensure that our fourth quarter profitability was maximized, and that the company is well-positioned to capture the upside when the business environment turns more positive. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry who will discuss the results from each of our end markets, and provide a short-term outlook. Jerald G. Fishman It is Jerry again. Let me give you -- try and give you a little bit of color on what has happened in each of the end markets and what would be logical to assume going forward. In the industrial market for the full fiscal year, our revenues, which includes industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare, grew 10% over prior year levels to $1.4 billion and represented 47% of our sales for the year.  The largest year-over-year increases were in the areas of industrial automation, instrumentation and energy management, all of which grew by double digits from levels of our fiscal 2010. For the fourth quarter, our sales to industrial customers declined 14% sequentially to about $313 million or 44% of total sales. For this quarter, industrial customers were much more cautious in response to uncertain economic conditions around the world, leading in many cases, to very significant sequential inventory reductions.  The industrial sales decline was very broad-based, spanning all customer tiers, both the small and large customers, all application areas and all geographies. However, throughout the month of October and into November, all the levels from our industrial companies appear to have stabilized. Many of our largest industrial customers, particularly in the USA and Europe, where most of our industrial business is today, have told us that they're still forecasting mid-single digit growth for 2012 barring further deterioration in the macro environment.  We continue to believe that over the long term, the industrial market offers significant growth opportunity in line with ADI's overall corporate growth rate objectives, driven by our customers' needs for increased energy efficiency, industrial automation, higher precision healthcare and diagnostics and advanced instrumentation. In 2011, our automotive revenues grew 25% from the prior year, and at a $415 million annual level has more than doubled in size from our fiscal 2009.  Automotive, which represented 14% of our revenues for the year in 2011, continues to be an area upon which we're focusing investments given the pervasive need of increasing electronic content in cars and our very strong product position in providing technology solutions for this market.  Despite all the economic headwinds, our automotive business was very strong in the fourth quarter. Revenues from our automotive customers were approximately $113 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11% from the third quarter, and an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year.  This was yet another quarterly record for automotive revenue, which in Q4 of 2011, represented 16% of our total revenues. In addition to the macro trends driving automotive growth in Q4, we at ADI are benefiting from the pent-up demand stemming from the age of current vehicles on the road, and also, but to a lesser degree, the recovery from the Japanese earthquake. During Q4, safety systems represented a very large part of our automotive business, with particularly strong sales in the areas of airbags and stability control applications.  In addition, demand for our advanced driver systems, systems radar and vision applications also showed solid sequential growth in Q4. These systems are now gaining awareness amongst consumers, and manufacturers are increasingly incorporating them into higher volume, more mainstream vehicles. Car entertainment or infotainment also remained strong in Q4, particularly in the areas of the head units and audio amplifiers during the quarter.  Looking ahead, we believe that automotive will continue to be an important growth driver for ADI, and will continue to benefit from very favorable macro trends within the automotive space, in the areas of active and passive safety, infotainment and also fuel efficiency, all of which should continue to drive much higher dollar content per vehicle for ADI.  Overall, in fiscal 2011, communications infrastructure revenue grew 11% from last year, driven by very strong demand for mobile data. At just under $600 million, communications infrastructure sales comprised approximately 20% of ADI's total sales for the year. In our fourth quarter of 2011, communication infrastructure revenue was $137 million, which was down 9% versus Q3 levels.  Contributing to the fourth quarter sales decrease was the at least, temporary postponement of the China TD-SCDMA rollout, as well as macro driven customer inventory work-downs, stemming from an erosion in operated confidence.  These factors offset a revenue boost that we enjoyed during the quarter related to the Japanese recovery. So in total, sales to communications infrastructure customers represented 19% of ADI's Q4 sales. We expect that the communications infrastructure market will remain a very key area of opportunity for ADI, which is driven by increasing mobile broadband usage, and continued mobile subscriber growth, which is pushing increased infrastructure capital spending, and our analog and mixed signal products are extremely well-positioned with the leading suppliers of infrastructure in virtually every geography of the world.  For the full year, our consumer revenues declined by approximately 6% to $587 million. This year-over-year decline, is primarily the result of our intensifying focus on only higher value-added consumer applications, where our technology is highly differentiated and our position is sustainable over many, many generations of our customers' products. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue was about $153 million, which was up 8% sequentially.  In Q4, the sales to consumer customers represented 21% of our total sales. Most of the quarter-to-quarter increase we enjoyed in the consumer market in Q4 was primarily due to seasonal factors, particularly, in the areas of digital cameras and gaming products. On a regional basis, our revenues declined sequentially in all regions of the world, except for Japan in Q4.  So now, I'd like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2012, which at ADI will be a 14-week long quarter, which happens once every 7 years, I guess. During the fourth quarter that we just finished, order rates continued to slow but appeared to stabilize and our backlog decreased from the prior quarter.  We believe that our customers are continuing to take steps to reduce their inventory levels due to all the uncertainties in the worldwide economy, and we expect this trend to continue through our first quarter of 2012. During our fourth quarter, inventory distribution, as Dave mentioned, declined by 11% sequentially, which is a very, very significant inventory decline for distribution, and was down below what inventories distributors typically stock, which at ADI is approximately 8 weeks.  These inventory reductions at both customers and distributors coupled together with what is typically a seasonally weak quarter for us tends to cause us to expect that revenues will decline sequentially in Q1. Certainly, we'll have the advantage of an extra week in the first quarter, but the shutdowns for Christmas in Europe and North America at the end of December, and the Lunar New Year in Asia, which occurs this year in late January, which will be in our fiscal quarter, will likely mitigate or eliminate any of that benefit.  As such, our plan calls for revenues to be down sequentially in the vicinity of 5% to 10% sequentially. We're also planning to again, reduce production levels in Q1 consistent with the decline in revenues. We anticipate that this should have a negative effect on gross margins, which we're expecting to be approximately 63%, and that's probably plus or minus 50 basis points, depending on where the sales wind up and what the exact mix of our business is.  It's certainly possible that this will be the last quarter of reduced production levels given the low inventory levels of ADI products in all our channels. But that certainly assumes that the macroeconomic environment does not further deteriorate, and really, we have no way of gauging that. We plan to manage our expenses carefully, as we have been for many quarters. An extra week in the first quarter will drive operating expenses up by more than $10 million sequentially.  However, once again, with our variable expense model and some very careful expense management we believe we can hold operating expenses through a range of between $226 million and $229 million in the quarter. Assuming these levels of revenues, gross margin and expenses, we expect our diluted earnings will be in the range of $0.44 to $0.51 in the quarter.  So with all the data and all the factors that are going one way or another, my summary of the takeaways from this call are as follows: first, while in the short term, certainly times is very uncertain, I think by most measures, ADI is weathering the storm pretty well.  Our revenue declines are in line with many of our peers, and less than many others despite the fact that our peak quarter was well ahead of many of our supply challenged competitors. As demand picks up, we believe ADI is very well-positioned to continue to outgrow the semiconductor market as a result of better focus and sustainable mix of businesses aimed at the highest growth segments in the semiconductor market. Secondly, our resilient business model is working well. If Q1 turns out to represent the 12th quarter, as we hope it will, we believe that we will have produced significantly higher margins than in the last downturn despite the precipitous revenue declines that we have suffered.  Last, we're ready for significant leverage when conditions improve. Our inventories will be low internally and out in the channels, which will allow volume ramp-ups in our fabs, which should produce great improvements in gross margins sequentially. We're also committed to continuing very high service levels to our customers by maintaining our lead times at very short levels. As we said many times as we go through these cycles, our long-term success will be very dependent on how we respond to downturns, which routinely are occurring. Given all the current uncertainty, it's certainly very difficult to predict what will happen in the short term.  But as such, we have to respond by staying focused on doing what we do best. We will continue to pursue the opportunities in our strategic markets that offer the highest likelihood for sustainable success, which means they will continue to make -- that we will continue to make the necessary trade-offs, to allocate resources to those businesses that provide the greatest returns. These trade-offs necessitate making very tough choices sometimes, but this strategy protects our most important initiatives and thus preserves and enhances ADI's future.  In addition, we'll continue to vigilantly manage cost throughout the company as we have been doing over the past few years. This strategy produced excellent results for us during our fiscal 2011, a period that we were whipsawed by supply durations and economic turmoil. For the upcoming year, we plan to stay the course, delivering innovative products to customers that gives them a competitive advantage, adhering to the highest standards supply-chain responsiveness, quality and reliability, carefully managing our resources and stay focused on the key strategic programs, and protect profitability to the fullest extent possible given the hand that the market gives us. That's all the prepared remarks that we have. We'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Mindy Kohl [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for questions from our call participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] You have a question from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division The first question is in relation to your initiatives to jumpstart revenue growth, as well as throughout the organization. I was hoping to get an update on where you feel like you've made the most progress, and give us an update in general on what inning of the initiatives you're in? Especially in context of automotive having been the first pet project of yours, and it's showing very strong results. When can we expect some of the other program areas to begin yielding results similar to automotive? Jerald G. Fishman I think what you're referring to is that we put a new organization on the field about 2 years ago. One part of the organization focused on the market segments and the other on the core technologies it will take to drive those market segments. And I think some of the new initiatives that we're funding, and even some of the older things that we're juggling around funding, are basically the result of those 2 groups getting together, and setting the priorities. And also, it gives us a much more flexible structure to move resources around from one area to the other, with people that are very capable of working across different product groups or technology groups of boundaries. And we can make those changes relatively quickly. As we look -- the automotive as you mentioned, I think, is certainly one of those objectives. We've had other objectives in things like radio frequency and some of the micro-machine things we're doing, as well as I would say, expanding even our core businesses and converters and amplifiers and other products into some exciting new markets. So I would say that to a first approximation, that's working pretty well. And the hardest job that we have at Analog is where to put the money. I mean we have incredibly large opportunity for our technology in virtually every market in the world. Some of them are -- move up very quickly and they would go down very quickly, and commoditize, others go up a little slower, but once you get there, you have it forever. So what we're trying to do is aim more of the resources that the markets and the product segments, where the revenues increase and you develop a franchise in those products and markets, and you ride that franchise for many, many years. And I think our resource allocation that we're able to do as a result of this structure enables -- gives us a much, much clearer look at it, and as I said earlier, a much clearer path to move resources to the areas that show the most promise. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Okay. Then my follow-up question is another question on revenue growth. If we are in a later, lower growth phase of the economic cycle, does that influence your acquisition appetite, considering that your domestic cash now stands above $1.1 billion? Jerald G. Fishman Well certainly, that's a factor. We do have a lot of cash, it's not earning very much money. We have a lot of cash overseas, which is earning not so much money. We're not terribly interested in repatriating that cash and paying a usurious tax for the politicians to do it. So certainly, that's one of the factors that goes into our -- thinking about acquisitions. Although we are very disciplined about that. And we have a pretty high hurdle rate for doing acquisitions that are very strategic to Analog. So with the margin, it does change the economics a bit, but I still think we're going to be cautious about that. Operator We have a question from the line of with Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division I'm curious, in the last 2 years, your core converter business has undergrown your overall company sales growth. Conceptually, what is the reason behind that, what can reverse that trend, and how are you thinking about resources and converters versus other areas in an organic and inorganic basis? Jerald G. Fishman Well first our converter business is one of the most, if not the most important, business at ADI. And I think what's confusing a few of those statistics is that a lot of the converter products that we do, we integrate. And as they start getting to where the converter is just a piece of the solution, that goes into the category of other Analogs. And as a result, you'll see the growth of other Analog is very substantial. And a bit -- part of the reason for that is in the converter business. The other part is we have de-emphasized some of the consumer investments, which utilize some converters towards other things. So that has impacted that a little bit. But I think that the primary reason for that, is really the integration of converters with RF products, with linear products and power products, into some very highly integrated Analog solutions. And I think once that level of integration goes on, it sort of goes into a different category. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And as a follow-up Jerry, just as you look at revenue growth for next year, the handset market is one of the key growth markets, and I understand that in the past, you have de-emphasized, that market is only about 3% or so of sales and it is a very volatile market. But do you think about participating in that market? I know you have indirect exposure to the infrastructure piece, but how about direct exposure to handsets? How about increasing that exposure? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we have products that go into handsets, what we actually strategically de-emphasized was the baseband or the modem, which commoditized at a staggering rate, even for some of our competitors that were much larger than us. So I think the part that we've decided not to do anymore that we sold, was the baseband modem. Now where there are opportunities in the handsets to provide value that really does differentiate the features of the phone, we do invest in that, and we have some good products and they sell into handsets, and those are things we're going to continue to do. One example of that is in the audio business, where some of our audio products make a huge difference in audio fidelity in phones, and where we can do that and we've got a big lead and we think the technology is sustainable, we certainly invest in that. So within that whole category of portable products and smartphones, there is opportunity for ADI. We're just not, we seized and sold all investment in the digital baseband, which I guess turned out to be not such a bad thing to do. Operator We have a question from the line of Chris Danely. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division If you could just run down the 4 main end markets? And maybe talk about how you view inventory in each of those end markets? And also, spend a little bit of time on industrial and common maybe, how they are trending? When you would expect those to start to bottom here and come back? Jerald G. Fishman Chris, there are 2 effects going on I think in virtually every market segment. And one of those effects is, inventory got too high and it got much too high as our customers reduced their expectations for the next couple of quarters. So whatever inventory reductions we had, which we thought were coming to conclusion, didn't really account for the fact that the denominator was going down, as well as numerator. So I think the inventory corrections we're seeing are more pronounced than perhaps we would have thought a while ago. For the -- if you look at -- so that's the inventory part of the equation. What's really going to drive what happens over the next couple of quarters, in a lot of ways, is going to be CapEx. Certainly, the industrial business, capital spending drives our sales. And I think in the communications infrastructure business, CapEx also drives our sales. So if you go out and look at the forecast for that, as we look at those very, very carefully, the forecasts are really all over the map. In some cases, people think that there is going to be growth in the vicinity of 5% to 10% in some of those end markets for next year, and other people think it's going to be negative. And if you just sort of average all those expectations, I think the mainstream prediction is that it's probably going to be about mid-single digits. Now I think if it turns out that, that's what happens in 2012, then I think our communications infrastructure business and industrial businesses should do very well because those businesses tend to grow at a multiple of capital spending. But we really don't know and just as you read all these reports either from the banks or the people that study capital spending very closely, we just don't know when that is going to happen. So we don't know when we'll get a response for that. I think we're getting to be relatively confident that the inventory correction is getting towards being over given the inventory levels we see customers on our distributors. But the real question is going to be what end demand is going to be, and I think we'll just have to wait and see how that turns out. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Got it. And then from a follow-up on OpEx, so with the increased amount of variable costs in the 14-week quarter, after this quarter, does that mean that OpEx should be able to go down on an absolute basis? David A. Zinsner A lot of it obviously depends on what the revenue does in the following quarter. But on a kind of an apples-to-apples basis, considering the fact that we are having quite a bit of pressure in the OpEx from the extra week, we don't envision having that repeat itself obviously, because there'll be 1 less week in the following quarter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division The deferred revenues were down, I think 16% sequentially, and then that's consistent with the distributor inventories declining so much. Dave, I think you said that they were -- disti inventory was below the normal of 8 weeks, but I don't -- I didn't catch whether or not you quantify it further. Can you give us a sense of how far below 8 weeks? Are we talking 7.9 weeks or 7 weeks? Any color there would be helpful. David A. Zinsner It's closer to 7 weeks of inventory. It was just below the 8-week target. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And on that same line, can you give us a sense of your OEM customers? So anything that you're shipping directly, give a sense of whether or not your OEM customers are taking them well below normal as well. David A. Zinsner Not surprisingly, we don't get inventory reports from our OEM customers to give us a sense for what their inventory levels are like. So we can't really answer that with any degree of accuracy. What we do believe though is that inventory is declining at our OEM customers, and that's more qualitative than quantitatively. So our opinion is that inventories are reducing at OEMs. Jerald G. Fishman I mean our sense -- to just give that a little bit more color, is that when we look at our order rates from our largest OEMs, and how much they're down, and we look at what our largest OEMs are telling us about their business levels, our sales to our OEMs is much more negative than they're saying their sales are to their customers. So I think all that's indicative of fairly significant inventory declines with those large OEMs. But as Dave said, the distribution data we get every week, the OEM data we get from our sales guys. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division So obviously, it's encourage. I was wondering, can you remind us what -- how low they got below normal in the worst of it in 2008? David A. Zinsner In terms of a days perspective? Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Yes, in terms of weeks. David A. Zinsner They were -- they had gone in a little bit below 7 weeks, but it was in that kind of range. Operator You're next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crdit Suisse. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division I guess, David, my first question just on the gross margin line. Can you kind of quantify a little bit in the October quarter, and then again, for the guidance in January? What do you think was mix related versus utilization related? And I guess specifically to January, how much lower do you think you guys will take utilization in the quarter? David A. Zinsner In the fourth quarter, about 2/3 of it was mix related, and the other 1/3 was the absorption in the factories. This quarter, it's going to be primarily absorption, we wouldn't expect mix to be a factor. We'll be taking utilization this quarter down to -- I think, it's 63%, 64% that's down from 73% or 74% this quarter. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division And then guys, as my follow-on, Jerry, can you talk a little bit about, on the first fiscal quarter outlook on revenue, how the end markets are trending for the January quarter? And I guess, help me understand as you think about the turn of the business, which end markets do you think will actually be the leaders in that turn? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that of course is very hard to predict. We can't even predict the aggregate very well, forget about the detail. But our sense is, we had a 15 or so percent sequential decline in the industrial business. Now when you think about that, that's a business with tens of thousands of customers. And the whole thing went down 15% sequentially, which -- that's the business where you see changes happening very, very slowly, usually. So I think what happened is, when the large industrial customer base, in particularly, in Europe, the United States started reading the newspapers, they got very concerned and they put the brakes on very quickly. And I think that was aided and abetted by our distributors who tend to react very, very quickly to perturbations. So I think most of what's going to happen is going to be dependent now, that they've taken the inventory down so fast, and what happens with capital spending if CapEx starts to get a little easier. If people get a more confident, I think the industrial business will be one of the first ones that will see the turn up in. If it turns out that everybody listens to CNBC and gets depressed every day, all around the world, and all the CEOs come on there and say, with all this uncertainty, I'm just going to put off what I'm going to do, then I think it will take longer. Certainly what we're expecting in our guidance, is that our first quarter, our consumer revenues will probably be down. I mean that happens even in a good economy in the first quarter after the holiday build-ups. So I mean that's the part that we know pretty much for sure. The rest of it, we just don't know. But the industrial business will probably be the first business that will signal the upturn. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division I'm just trying to interpret the recent order activity, you mentioned orders had stabilized in October and November. Given your leverage to the industrial and communications segment, Jerry, is it typical for you to see orders improve in the year end in preparation for a seasonally stronger first half? Or would you expect things to actually slow down if factories worldwide shutdown for the holidays? Jerald G. Fishman I mean our sense and again, we don't know this any better than you do, is that as you get out towards the end of December, the order rates will slow down in the U.S. and Europe -- and our hope, and that's built into our plan, is what typically happens is in January, we hit a pretty good pickup. So that's -- if the plan comes through this quarter, it will probably be with that type of pattern. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Okay. That's helpful. If your customers are to remain cautiously optimistic about the business, given that inventories are approaching 2008 lows, would it be reasonable to assume then that your business would see a better than normal type of growth in the April period as customers restock? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's certainly logical based on if you're stock and inventories again. But I would -- if you ask me right now, I would settle for a seasonal increase in Q2, given where it is right now. So -- but certainly, what you say is logical, I just don't know if that's the way it will play out. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan. Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division I wanted to dig into the orders again. It sounded like you guys mentioned stabilization. Should we assume that orders actually went up from -- in the October to November time frame? And then I have a follow-up. Jerald G. Fishman No, I think what we defined as stabilization is they stopped going down. Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Fair enough. And then Dave, I had a quick clarification for you. Gross margins past the first quarter, if revenue stabilized and you start to sort of build inventory, should we think that the first quarter will mark the bottom for gross margin? All things considered? David A. Zinsner All things considered, I think that's correct. Jerald G. Fishman Don't forget in the gross margins, we're putting now, we normally have lower revenues, but we have a lot less product that we're building to distributors. And even though that doesn't detract from our revenues, it certainly detracts from our factory builders, which is why Dave is making that comment. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research So you had commented a little bit on the converters and other Analog and some other dynamics there. I was wondering if you could comment on what's happening in the digital signal processor part of your business, and where your focus areas are and why that was relative to the rest of your business? Pretty weak in the quarter, as well as year-over-year? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think the DSP business is a business that has both a many customer dimension, which is a lot of different customers buy it, and it has a large customer dimension. Some of the DSP business that we have is heavily consumer-oriented. And I -- certainly anything that's going into the consumer market right now, our overall consumer business year-over-year was down, and the DSP part of that is no exception. So I think there's a part of it that's related to just the overall malaise in the market, and there's another part of it that's very related to some large programs and some large primarily consumer customers. I think as business recovers, that business, particularly in the industrial side of the market, should respond in a very similar way to our Analog business. Because historically, that's what happens. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. And then, the next question is on your own -- actually a 2-part second question. Can you disclose your 13-week backlog? I believe you do disclose that at the end of this fiscal year. And do you expect your inventory, ADI's inventory to be up in fiscal Q1? David A. Zinsner The 13-week backlog as of the end of the year was $379 million. We disclose in the 10-K tomorrow. We're expecting inventory on our balance -- part of it is difficult to tell because, it somewhat depends on what the distributors do with their inventories. But we're thinking that the inventories on -- in an absolute dollar basis, this quarter will be not much be different that they are, than they were at the end of the year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, if you'll see better gross margin on lower revenue this cycle and previously? So could you get to, say, a 67% gross margin on a lower revenue base this quarter, given improvements you may be making also in the organization? David A. Zinsner All things being equal, they are incrementally better than in the previous cycle, because we did reduce some structure -- we made some structural improvements that reduced our cost per unit. However, obviously mix factors into it and whatnot, so that may not be accurate every quarter. But I would say on an absolute basis, prior peak versus our prior cycle versus this cycle, we should be incremental better. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division I mean what revenue level do you think it would take for you guys to, say, 70% or better gross margin? David A. Zinsner Well, we don't have necessarily 70%, so I can't get into that, Steve. Jerald G. Fishman I think roughly, a lot of that depends on the mix of business since the gross margin by industry segment varies quite a bit. So I think that's a better question when we get back to 67, and then, we'll give you an idea what might happen after that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Jerry, you were talking about value-added consumer businesses. Which of the consumer businesses that you're in at the moment offer you the best growth opportunities you think? And are there any emerging consumer segment you're interested in? Jerald G. Fishman Well, a lot of the segments offer a lot of growth potential. The question is whether the products that we want to do, will be highly differentiated enough over a long enough period of time in order to get the benefit of that. Historically, a large part of our consumer businesses have been in products like digital cameras and gaming things, but I think when you look forward, those positions are fine, and we can continue to innovate in those areas. But I think increasingly, you'll see Analog products in more affordable equipment, and potentially, even some broadcast equipment, which are basically, consumer products. So again, what we're really looking for, David, is just products that you get them designed in, and you go through a couple of generations of our customers products, with them still believing that this product is very valuable. And that's what's going to define what products we're in. Operator Your next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division I guess first question, Jerry, you talked about orders stabilizing in November. I guess curious, is that broad-based or particular to one segment? And I guess as part of that question, if you can walk through, relative to the midpoint of the guide, what you see for each of the segments in terms of strengths, weaknesses that would be helpful. Jerald G. Fishman Well, as far as the order stabilizing, as what I said before is that, they were -- they ran down and they stopped running down, which is always a good sign. And so that started happening in October and November when we had no idea if they were going to keep going down, or just stabilized, and they sort of stopped going down, and therefore, businesses running at these levels, I'd say over the last 6 to 8 weeks. In terms of the guidance by segment, we just don't have that level of detail. There are -- the only assumption we have in there is that we expect our consumer business to be down sequentially, because it always is, and that's sort of a guarantee. And the question of what happens between our communications infrastructure business, our industrial business and particularly, some of the soft categories in those very, very hard to predict, all we can do is look at the averages and that's what we've done. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division That's helpful. And then Dave, as my follow up, if I look at your gross deferred revenues, you're running at high 300s. And at a mid kind of 600 revenue run rate. In the past, you've been close to the kind of mid-200, low 200s. So I guess curious, given what you said in terms of the drawdown of inventory at the distis, will that be complete you think, to that kind of low 200 level, exiting January? Or might that still be an issue beyond that? David A. Zinsner Well, on a day basis, distributor inventory is below their target levels. So I guess a lot depends on what the disti business does over the course of the next couple of quarters. If the first quarter turns out to be the bottom, probably the deferred margin goes down a little bit more and then starts to move back up from here, and that's kind of our operating assumption at the moment. But a lot depends obviously on whether we really will see the bottom in the first quarter. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division And if that holds true, is gross margin -- does gross margin start bottoming in January or April? David A. Zinsner If that holds true and inventory starts to grow at distribution, we will certainly -- in all likelihood, be taking our production levels up, that will be beneficial to the gross margin. So we expect the first quarter to be the low point. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Co. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, I just wanted to clarify your comments regarding factory shutdowns. Were you referring just to ADI or factory shutdowns that you're hearing about from your customers? And if the latter, what segments are those coming from? Jerald G. Fishman I'd say both. We're going to shut down a little bit longer than we normally do, certainly in manufacturing and many of the other areas as well. And we just have anecdotal comments from customers in many different market segments about the potential of expanded shutdowns. But we don't get a lot of visibility to the details of that. And what we have is anecdotes from customers, which you probably had better ones than we do. But our assumption is, given all the chaos and given all their obvious desire to reduce inventories, it would not be illogical to them to have extended shutdowns this quarter. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division That sounds reasonable. A follow-up question is on company specific initiative, since there's a lot that's out there that's outside your control, just focus on some things that are inside your control. At analyst day, you talked about pricing initiatives that I took to mean doing a better job of pricing for functional value and I think maybe more recently the company's really focused on its new product introduction to processes, and trying to do a better job hitting commercial windows with that. Can you give us an update on those 2 initiatives and tell us how those are impacting the business as we see it? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think I can give you qualitative answers on that. We've done analyses inside the company in terms of pricing, given that we priced 10,000 products to 100,000 customers, it's sort of hard to be precise on that. But we've seen a pretty good improvement in our margins as a result of pricing actions that we've taken. Particularly, I'd say on the older products that we have, which some of them go on and sell for 10 or 20 years. And customers are very thankful to have a source of supply to that period, and are quite willing to pay a little bit higher prices at the margin to ensure that. Because the price of getting those products out and put another one in it, well in excess of the price that we want. So I think on that dimension, we're doing better. We're also doing better at making sure we don't have a lot of ASP leakage into the system. Through our distributors and through other people that price our products, we're just being a lot -- we have a lot better systems to understand what's going on, and what you inspect you should expect to get better, and we're inspecting all that stuff pretty carefully. We do monitor very carefully our Average Selling Prices by product area, by geography, by customer. We have tremendously credible information systems in the company on every dimension that we're capable of understanding and actioning, where we see perturbations that don't seem right to us. So I'd say we can always do more, and I think we will do more in the future, but we've made some pretty good progress to date, which is helping our gross margins. And I think it's one of the reasons that Dave indicated a lot of enthusiasm about the gross margins in the future. On the new product stuff, that's also -- that we introduced between 200 and 400 new products a year. And I think the best vehicle to get our growth up on those questions is to make sure that they're the right products. So portfolio prioritization and adjustments that we've been making and that we will continue to make are one of the best vehicles to make sure that we actually put products in the market that are going to sell. Of course, we have tremendously more pressure on the system to get the products out on time. And one of the ways to that other than beating everybody up, which we do I guess as well as anybody, is to make sure that the product we're trying to get out are properly resourced. And that means that the ones we're serious about, we add resource to, and the ones we're not serious about, we take resources out. So overall I think that's really helped the most, and it's really going to demonstrate itself in future years, because what we bring out this year not only helps 2011 and 2012, but it really helps the out years. So the sooner you get it out, the sooner you get the design ins, The sooner you get the design ins, the sooner revenue comes. And many of these products have very long revenue tails on them. So again, these are not things that have instantaneous uplift in the short-term, but I think over time, on the new product side, it's going to impact our growth rates. And on the product side, it's going to impact both our growth rates and our margins. So I think more is better, but I think we're doing okay. Operator Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just a question on the OpEx side of things, how should I think about the extra week versus the shutdowns? Are they pretty much offsetting one another or is one larger than the other? David A. Zinsner Unfortunately, no one lets us not pay them for the week -- so we actually incur the expense regardless on the salaries and such. Where we do save a bit of money is just we obviously aren't turning the lights on with a little less activity in the -- just like line by consulting and travel and those things. So we save a little bit of money there, but we do incur the expense associated with the employees. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Jerry, one in the competitive landscape, during downturns like this in the past, we've seen competitors take various strategies. Some wanting to run their fabs, some getting aggressive on price to keep the fabs full, et cetera. Have you seen any strange activity in the competitive landscape during this downturn? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think our company will keep doing the same thing in every cycle. So the ones in the commodity businesses, where price is the only determinant you see, you just see a lot of people going out there, dropping prices. That's not where most of our products are. In fact, when we look at our Average Selling Prices, which given the dynamic range of prices that we have from one product to another, they're remarkably stable, so we're not seeing almost any real change. We see a change in mix, and that changes things a little bit. But the mix adjusted, average selling price stays the same. In the last cycle, we saw different competitors doing different things. We've decided that we should reduce our production levels to get the best, we have plenty of inventory, we can turn them up very quickly, we're not laying off a bunch of people, so we'll have trained people ready so that when business picks up, we have trained people that are capable of building the products. There's very different competitive responses out there. Some companies just lay a whole bunch of people off. Some people just build inventory to keep their fabs running so they don't have margin deterioration. Our sense after many, many years of experience, and sometimes, being -- doing the right things, and sometimes doing the wrong things. Is that the best strategy for ADI is to keep most of the people, and keep the inventory levels down and have a supply chain that's flexible where our customers can count on. And that's, at least over the last cycle or 2, what we've done, worked out well for us, particularly relative to some of our more notable competitors, and I think that's what we're going to do again. Operator Your next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division This is Mark Delaney, calling in for Jim Covello. I was hoping you could talk a little more about the comm infrastructure business? First if you have any visibility on when the Chinese build-out might continue? And then second, what kind of impacts do you think the LTE build-out might have for you guys in 2012? Vincent T. Roche Let we try and address the TD-SCDMA thing first. While, there has been obviously a delay in during 2011, but the expectation at least from what we're hearing in China from our customers is that somewhere in the first half of 2012 we can expect a significant build on the TDS site, but I should point out as well, TD-SCDMA is actually a pretty small part of our communications infrastructure business overall. But we depend obviously, on the more pervasive standards like 3G and LTE for our revenue streams. But on TDS side anyway, we expect something to happen in the first half of 2012. Operator Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I have -- first one on OpEx. So I know you have this trade-off between the extra week and everything else, but I mean basically, if I normalize your spend for 14 weeks this quarter versus the 13 weeks last quarter, I come up with about $12 million in OpEx on a normalized basis which is just coming out. So can you give me some feeling for how much of that is just a simple reduction in variable comp, given the reduction year-over-year growth in operating profit, versus other -- I guess other initiatives that you're taking? Give me some feeling for how much of those cuts, and even the cuts that you saw this quarter might be temporary versus permanent? I'm trying to get some feeling for how we ought to be looking at the OpEx roll forward -- going forward in the quarters? David A. Zinsner Well, to make sure I'm understanding it properly. So our expense was $225 million, it was down roughly $6 million from last quarter. There was no extra week this quarter or nor was there an extra week last quarter. So this was a straight apples-to-apples change. It was all predominantly related to a reduction in the variable compensation. And then, we did a few things on the austerity program side to bring the expense in a little bit more. And then on the offsetting side, we did have a couple million dollars restructuring in the quarter. Next quarter, our guidance is for it to be up slightly to maybe $4 million or so. We'll probably, as you say, get at least $10 million, maybe even close to your number, $12 million, of additional expense associated with the extra week, however we are... Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division And then, that would save. So if I divide Q4 by 13, and if I divide Q1 by 14, and then I just look at the weekly OpEx, you're taking it down about $1 million or close to $1 million a week on a normalized basis? David A. Zinsner Yes, now some of that is the variable compensation coming down, and then some of that, quite honestly, is just -- we're going to be under some pressure internally to keep the discretionary spend to an absolute minimum. And then, one of the things we're doing internally is shutting the facilities down for a couple of weeks across most of the locations. And so the hope is that our activity spend will be down a little bit as well, and so that should help keep the expenses contained. Does that make sense, Stacy? Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Yes, so is it more like happening -- comps versus the other thing, because I'd expect the variable comp to go with the operating metric, with some of the others ought to come back -- I would think in revenue. David A. Zinsner So variable comp is probably down a couple of million dollars, quarter-over-quarter. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division And for my follow up, just something very broad. I guess the maximum and minimum range of your revenue guidance, can you give me some feeling for what sort of -- from what would have to happen to reach the top end of your guidance and what would have to happen to reach the bottom? What do you have baked in on both extremes? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think -- so a great deal of it will be determined by just the macro stuff. Our sense is that the inventories are going to continue to go down, and that's going to be result in some additional decline. But I think when the history is written, it will be mostly -- particularly, as we get into January, about what actually customers' consumption of our products is. And -- I mean that's the way these cycles go. First, demand is ahead of consumption, then it's behind consumption, then it equals consumption. And our hope is that once you get out to January or so, demand and consumption start to look alike. And if that happens, that should be a positive. But we just don't know. Mindy Kohl We have time for just one more question, because we've gone over our allotted time. Operator We have one last question from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Dave, can I just ask you to conceptualize the utilization rates this quarter, if it went back to periods of -- if we excluded 2008 and 2009, which was probably an extraordinary period than possibly 01, 02? How does this compare with previous inventory corrections? Is this kind of where it bottoms normally? David A. Zinsner We've been down to 50% in terms of utilization, so it's clearly a lower number. Now, to be fair, we have more capacity at the time we were down to 50%, so we have taken out some of that capacity. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Yes, that's what I was hoping to kind of help understand. So if -- how much capacity do you think is being taken out just so that we can say, okay, this is kind of way bottomed on the inventory correction and kind of try and get a number to this. David A. Zinsner I don't have that number in front of me. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay I'll follow up off-line. Jerry, you were describing what was going on with TD-SCDMA, you had talked about a temporary pause and resumption in the first half of 2012. So 2 questions here. One is, how much more expense do you think we'll need before we could say all the phases required is done in TD. And I know it's a small part of your portfolio. And then looking into 2012, your financial comm infrastructure, how comfortable in terms of the compositions you have with your customers, how do you think the demand should play out in 2012 for the other parts of the comm infrastructure business? That's my last question. Vincent T. Roche Well, on the TDS side, there's still -- I believe, several phases planned. But to give you a specific number, I'm not in a position to do that. But we take this one year at this time. As you know, in China, we have many standards playing against each other. 2G, 3G, and 4G coming online as well. So all those standards are going to play into the mix. And ultimately, it will be really consumers who decide which standards get to play long-term. With regard to demand overall, I believe our customers are looking at risk again, 2012. Some of the larger customers out there have done very, very well during 2011. I expect those customers will do well again in 2012, in developed markets, where there's a massive ongoing demand for mobile data, driven by the need to be able to move video wirelessly across the network. And I think certainly in Europe and America and Japan, that need is going to continue on a basis and will drive what we believe to be very, very good demand. Both in the wireless sector, and as you know, we play in the radio front ends there. There's no dampening on the requirement for innovation in that area. And also, as we move more and more high bundle data through the wireless network, it creates a need to be able to move the data in packet form through the fixed networks, as well as, such as optical and cable. So our customers are bullish and we're bullish. And certainly on the wireless side, we're expecting growth over the long-term in the double-digit area in the communications infrastructure areas. Mindy Kohl Okay, that concludes our Q&amp;A session. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again during our first quarter 2012 earnings call. Thank you.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Why Analog Devices' Dividend Is Solid - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "   Although analyzing historical trends is important, we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, dividend analyzer, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion for the financial advisor. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Analog Devices Inc. , as well as its dividend under this framework.Investment ConsiderationsClick to enlargeReturn on Invested CapitalAnalog Devices' DividendAnalog Devices' dividend yield is above average, offering a 3.4% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio.We think the safety of Analog Devices' dividend is excellent . We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year.We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter . As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons:  the higher the ratio, the more \"cushion\" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and  the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Analog Devices, this score is 2.9, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated.In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels . The Dividend Cushion also caught the recent cuts by J.C. Penney Company Inc.  and Supervalu Inc. . Check out this article here to read how we warned advisors about SuperValu's impending dividend cut. We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Now on to the potential growth of Analog Devices' dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the \"cushion\" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for Analog Devices. It simply has fantastic excess cash flow capacity.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss . In Analog Devices' case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium . If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. All things considered, the growth potential and safety of Analog Devices' dividend are attractive, and the size of its yield makes the firm worth considering as a potential income play.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Husain, you may begin your conference. Ali Husain Thanks, Samantha. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If listeners haven't yet seen our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 press release, or our form 10-K, both may be accessed through our website at investor.analog.com. This conference call is also accessible from the same page. A recording of this conference call will be available today within about 2 hours of this call's completion. It will remain available via telephone playback for a period of time and it will also be archived on the IR website. In addition, we've updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;L for continuing operations, as well as historical quarterly and annual information per revenue from continued operations by end market and product type. Participating with me on today's call are Jerry Fishman, Chief Executive Officer; Vincent Roche, President; and Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part the call, Jerry, Vince and Dave will present our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 results, as well as our short-term outlook. The remainder of the time will be devoted to answering questions from our analysts and investor participants. During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain non-recurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website. I'd ask you to please note that the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for Safe Harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed earlier today. The forward-looking information that's provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of date of the live broadcast, which is November 27, 2012. And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for joining our call. As the press release said, our revenues for Q4 totaled about $695 million, which was up approximately 2% from the previous quarter and down about 3% from the same quarter last year. These results were within the guidance range that we provided last quarter and are relatively strong results in what has turned out to be a very challenging environment. The diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which was slightly above the midpoint of our earlier guidance. For the full year of 2012, revenue declined just under 10% to about $2.7 billion, which was a reflection of a poor economic environment for most of our fiscal year, coupled with unprecedented global uncertainty, which severely constrained capital spending in virtually all of our served markets. The only exception was our automotive business, which actually grew 11% year-over-year. But even in automotive, we showed some signs of a slowdown in the second half of 2012. Vince, our new President, our newly appointed President, will describe in much more detail the current trends and the outlooks that we see in each of our end markets. Despite the lower revenues and the uncertainty throughout the year, ADI still produced a very credible result for the year, with gross margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 31% and operating cash flow of over $800 million, or about 30% of sales. In addition, we enhanced shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases that totaled over $500 million during the fiscal year. We also ended the fiscal year with net cash -- or the gross cash we have less our debt, at over $3.1 billion. Today, it's still a very challenging environment in virtually every region of the world. During Q4, the overall orders decreased at ADI, as customers became increasingly more cautious and our distributors reduced their inventories. We believe in Analog today that our current order rates are below the consumption rates of our products. Our book to bill for the quarter fell below 1, and we're entering Q1 with lower opening backlog than we had when we entered Q4 of 2012. Given the continuing uncertainty out there, we've taken many actions around the company to protect the downside, while ensuring that we'll be ready for a snapback in order rates, which typically occurs with very little notice in our business. First, we began reducing our production levels in Q4, and we're planning to reduce them further in the first quarter to keep our inventory at appropriate levels. While operating our factories well below capacity will certainly reduce our gross margins in the short term, it will provide significant upside leverage, as it has in the past, when revenue growth resumes. During the last down cycle, when our factories were being utilized at about 67%, our trough gross margins were about 63%. During the upturn, when utilization rates approached 80%, we achieved gross margins of over 67%. We're confident in our ability to achieve these gross margin levels, as business conditions improve, as factory utilization increases and as our product mix reverts to more typical and traditional levels for ADI. Just as in the previous cycle, we're keeping our lead times very short, providing very high service levels to our customers and remaining ready for any changes in market momentum. Secondly, we've taken action throughout Analog Devices to reduce our expenses corporate-wide by moving resources to the most strategically relevant programs and away from those programs with less long-term potential. We're also planning to gain efficiencies with our new organization, which more closely aligns our product development programs with our customers' requirements. We're also planning a corporate-wide shutdown over the holiday period to give all our employees around the world a very deserved -- well-deserved rest, after a very challenging year, and this will provide temporary expense relief for Analog during the first quarter. Thirdly, our variable incentive program that is operating for all Analog employees, which is directly tied to our growth rate and our operating margins, will normally modulate expenses in down cycles as it did in the last down cycle. In addition for 2013, we've increased the margin thresholds for incentive payments to levels more consistent with what we believe the business is capable of producing on the average. So therefore, for the same levels of performance, the bonus or incentive payments will be slightly lower. The effect of this change will likely be to reduce incentive payments in -- of 2013, beyond what would be typical and normal in previous times. We believe that these actions will be responsive to the downside, while also preparing us for the upside, which invariably follows in every cycle for ADI over many, many years. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Vince, for some more detail on our performance and the trends in some of the end markets that we serve. Vincent T. Roche Well, thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everybody. Well as expected, our strongest sequential growth was in the consumer end market, which grew by 28% in the fourth quarter. The increase in consumer revenue was broad-based in what was a seasonally stronger consumer quarter, coupled with a strong product cycle for ADI. Our results were particularly good in audio and imaging applications in the portable space. Consumer was about 20% of total sales, up from 16% in the prior quarter. Communications infrastructure grew by 3% sequentially and was higher than our plan coming into the quarter, which is a very good result, especially after a 10% sequential increase in the prior quarter. Wireless infrastructure growth -- drove the growth this past quarter, a combination of consumers who are buying LTE, or 4G ready smartphones, from companies such as Apple, Samsung and others, and ongoing wireless network build-outs in developed and developing economies is leading service providers to upgrade their networks. U.S. providers are advertising, as you know, their LTE networks and enhancing increased CapEx spending plans. We also saw activity in the fourth quarter among our base station customers as they began to respond to China's announcement of TD-SCDMA Phase 6 and the 120,000 sites planned, which is twice the 2011 rollout. While GSM and 3G in particular, are the largest portion of our wireless revenue today, LTE, or 4G, is growing quickly, and will be a very significant growth driver in the coming few years. Communications revenue was 20% of total sales, consistent with the prior quarter. While the first quarter is expected to be steady to the fourth quarter, we expect wireless infrastructure deployments to more meaningfully impact our results towards the end of 2013. Now industrial revenues, which we expected would be stable in the fourth quarter, actually declined 5% sequentially, in line with lower industrial production worldwide as dictated by the ongoing macro weakness and also as a result of continuing reduction in inventories by our industrial customer base. This market represents a myriad of small and midsized customers primarily served through our distribution channel, as well as many of the world's largest industrial equipment makers, and none of these customers had immunity from the decline. Most industrial application already [ph] declined sequentially, including process control, instrumentation and measurement equipment and medical imaging. Regionally, we saw the most pronounced declines in Europe and Japan. Defense and aerospace and medical instrumentation were relatively flat sequentially. The industrial end market represented 44% of total sales in Q4, down from 47% in the prior quarter. On the automotive side, revenue declined by 4% sequentially, mostly as a result of lower unit sales of automobiles in Europe and in line with widely reported factory slowdowns at automotive manufacturers. While the declining revenue reflected the general weakness in automotive, we saw continued strength in newer products for Advanced Driver Assistance and powertrain efficiency systems, as our customers continued to deploy our innovative products in these growth sectors. Overall, automotive represented 16% of sales compared to 17% in the prior quarter. Now on an annual basis, automotive was an obvious bright spot, growing 11% during fiscal '12 compared to FY '11, the third consecutive year of double-digit growth. All major automotive application areas grew year-over-year. Our mix of business in the fourth quarter was anomalous compared to the rest of fiscal '12, as seasonal growth in consumer was further accelerated by new product adoption of key accounts. Beginning in the first quarter, we expect the business to shift to a more typical revenue mix. So with that, I'll hand you over to Dave, who'll take us through the details of our financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Vince. As Jerry had mentioned, fourth quarter revenue increased approximately 2% sequentially to $695 million and decreased 9.8% for the year to $2.7 billion. Our gross margin was 63.8% in the fourth quarter. This was down 180 basis points from the 65.6% we reported in the third quarter and down very slightly from the same period last year when revenues were higher. While an anomalous mix was the key factor, as Vince just described, we also made a decision to further reduce production levels mid-quarter in response to lower industrial and distributor orders, which reduced utilization below our original plan. Utilization decreased from 74% in the prior quarter to 67% in the fourth quarter. Inventory on our balance sheet remained approximately flat to last quarter in dollar terms and was down on a days basis from 121 days in the prior quarter to 114 days in the fourth quarter. Weeks of inventory and distribution was down by 0.5 week and stood at about 7 weeks exiting the quarter, down from approximately 7.5 weeks in the prior quarter, which is a very significant adjustment in a short period of time. Channel inventories are now well below historical levels. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $228 million compared to $230 million in the prior quarter excluding restructuring expense taken in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to tight control of our expense and also due to our variable compensation model, which is linked to our year-over-year sales change and quarterly operating profit. Operating profits before tax for the fourth quarter were $215 million or 31% of sales, down 100 basis points from the prior quarter, excluding restructuring charges taken in the prior quarter and a solid result in the current environment. Other expense of $3 million in the fourth quarter was flat to the third quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense. Our fourth quarter tax rate was approximately 16%, which represents an adjustment of our annual tax rate from 22% to 20%. We continuously look for efficiencies in our tax structure and based on current assumptions, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18% for each quarter in fiscal 2013. Diluted earnings per share of $0.58 in the fourth quarter was above the midpoint of our guidance and up 4% sequentially from the prior quarter on a 2% increase in revenue. For the year, diluted earnings per share was $2.13. We generated very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter at 34% of revenue or $236 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $38 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $200 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter. Our accounts receivable balance was down about $6 million versus the last quarter on lower shipments, and our day sales outstanding decreased to 45 days from 46 days in the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, we purchased $21 million of our stock and distributed approximately $91 million or 51% of our net income in dividends to our shareholders. For the year, we repurchased $161 million of our stock and distributed $345 million in dividends to our shareholders. We plan to continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock and to enhance returns to our shareholders. Since the start of our repurchase program, the company has repurchased approximately 129 million shares, or $4.4 billion of company stock. We have approximately $560 million remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program. Our cash and short-term investments balance increased $135 million during the fourth quarter and now stands at $3.9 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion available domestically. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $822 million in debt outstanding, from net cash on a per outstanding share basis was slightly above $10. On November 26, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on December 18, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%. In summary, fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 delivered solid results during what turned out to be a very challenging period. So now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Thanks, Dave. Our current expectations for Q1 revenues is for a decline of between 6% and 12% sequentially, which is certainly a larger decline than we'd normally anticipate in a typical Q1 for ADI. The most significant sequential decline in Q1 is likely to be in our consumer business, where our typical Q1 sales decline is exacerbated by inventory drawdowns after our customers prerelease inventory builds in Q4. Based on the current forecasts from our largest communication customers and our largest automotive customers, we expect Q1 sales in those market segments should remain relatively flat to Q4 levels. So certainly, the big swing in Q1 will be industrial sales, which span a broad customer base in every geography. While the United States and Europe still comprise the bulk of our industrial sales, China is becoming a more important component of industrial sales over the past few years than it's been historically. Over many, many years of observation in our industrial business, it's very clear to us that industrial capital spending continues to drive our industrial business. And certainly, those trends have been, and are today, being negatively impacted by economic and tax uncertainties in the United States and in Europe and government actions in China. In addition, many of our largest customers have announced extended factory shutdowns in late December and early January in the holiday period and are continuing inventory reductions. And lastly, our distributors have predicted less than seasonal forecasts for their fourth calendar quarter, of which 2 months overlaps our first calendar quarter. On the other hand, if you want to look at the glass as half full, which some of us do, inventories at our industrial customers and our distributors are at extremely low levels, and our largest customers report that their business levels are stable and in some cases, improving. And that would suggest that they're going to begin to restock. But on balance, we believe at this juncture with the information we have as of now, it's prudent to be very cautious about what ADI's industrial sales are going to turn out to be in Q1, and we're planning for a sequential decline in this market segment in Q1. I think it's very important to note that we could get surprised in this segment. But it's more likely that any real upturn in our industrial business would occur in Q2 rather than in Q1, although it's still early to predict that. In response to the weak demand environment that we experienced in Q4 and that we're planning in Q1, we're planning to further reduce factory operating levels in our production facilities, as I mentioned in my opening comments. In Q1, we're planning our factory utilization to drop from 67% in Q4 to the mid to high 50s in Q1, and for inventory dollars to be down, but days of inventory to be about flat given the significantly lower sales in Q1. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 62% in Q1, which hopefully will be the low point of this cycle. It's important to note, I think, that while changing inventory levels at our distributors don't affect our revenues, since we account for revenues worldwide on a sell-out methodology, when our distributors do start to restock to more traditional levels, it does positively impact our factory loadings and therefore positively impacts our gross margins. Given the strength of our position and the high market share that we enjoy in the industrial end markets, we'll be ready when a snapback in industrial does occur, as it always does. This will drive a better product mix, it will drive higher factory utilization and it will drive extraordinary operating leverage, as we demonstrated in previous cycles. We're planning for our operating expenses to be down approximately 2% in Q1 based on the actions that I outlined in my earlier comments, and earnings to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.48 for the quarter. In the longer term, we have an increasingly unique position at ADI, in the analog and signal processing market. We have very strong core technology, particularly in converters, in RF components and other linear functions, in MEMS, in power and in digital signal processing; and a very broad customer base, which provides great stability, but also provides the ability to leverage and bundle this technology into a much more complete and integrated solutions for a customer base that more and more depends on ADI to become their partner. We're now engaging with customers at much higher levels than in the past, and we get consulted and involved in their architectural and system needs at a very early level. And this will certainly pay off in terms of sales growth and higher margins as business levels stabilize in the future. The diversity of our end markets and of our 60,000 customers around the world where no consumer represented more than 5% of our sales in 2012, provide some measure of insulation from economic headwinds and product cycles and also, at the same time, provides the prospect of above-industry growth when the external world stabilizes. Now, we at Analog, the management team and the employees of Analog, have been through difficult periods many time in our history, and we continue to make the necessary trade-offs to position ourselves to respond when the market turns, as they always do. Structural improvements that we implemented in previous years give us an added advantage in navigating difficult periods and allow us to protect the downside while standing ready to capture the upside when conditions get better. Every time we've gone through one of these cycles, we come back better and we come back stronger, and I expect this time will be no different. Ali Husain Great. Thank you, Jerry. Thanks, Vince and Dave. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division The first question is related to gross margin. It seems like based on the utilization numbers that you've given of mid-50s for next quarter, it's a fairly pronounced action you're taking in the fabs. I guess my question is what's the motivation of that, given that inventory isn't too high? Is that more to just to set yourself up for a trajectory of extending gross margin in the April quarter? And if revenue were to grow in April of say 4% or 5%, would gross margin also bounce back then? David A. Zinsner So I'll take a stab at it; Jerry can add color if necessary. We're bringing our utilization down to 50 -- mid-50s levels. That is different than what we did last year at this time. We had a kind of a similar decline in revenue. But we allowed our days of inventory to kind of push up to 121 or 122 days last year. This time around, we're really trying to focus on keeping the days of inventory relatively flat, bringing the absolute dollars of inventory both on our balance sheet and the balance sheets of our distributors down. This is a bit different. The idea is it to get the inventories well balanced and then be ready to get the leverage when the business returns to growth. And as you point out, we had a big turn up in revenue in the second quarter. We have a pretty quick acceleration in the gross margins quickly back to the levels you saw us operate in back in a few quarters ago. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, I'd say the other comment, Terry, is that we monitor the order input quite frequently. And just like last quarter, as we monitored the orders, we -- turns for factories down a little harder than we had anticipated. If the order input justifies it -- we don't make these decisions once a quarter, we make them more frequently. And if the orders begin to turn up and we see anything that we believe is sustainable, we can ramp very quickly. And with the levels of inventory that we're carrying, we can respond extremely quickly to any upside our customers provide to us. So I think it's all those phenomena saying we want to manage the inventory responsibly. But we also, at the same time, want to make sure that when business does pick up, that we can respond to whatever our customers ask us for, given that on incremental sales, particularly on the stuff that we build internally, the gross margins are extremely high. So we don't want to miss any of those sales and we don't want to hang any of our customers out to dry. So those are our objectives, really, to keep the inventories under good control and yet, be flexible enough that we can respond very, very quickly to any input order rate increase that we see. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Crystal clear. And as a quick follow-up, really on the OpEx line. You guys did a terrific job in the prior cycle, really reducing OpEx to help improve the operating margin. But when I look over the past 8 quarters, on a revenue that's about down 15% from where it was 2 quarters ago, you're right at the same OpEx bogey. So we've seen OpEx sort of creep back up the past couple of years. What's the message to investors in terms of OpEx discipline here, as we've seen OpEx creep up a little bit relative to sales over the past couple of years? David A. Zinsner Well, it did creep up a little bit in the third and fourth quarter on a relative basis. But I think if you go back 8 to 12 quarters, we probably were averaging in the kind of the low 220s -- $220 million in terms of OpEx. That's where we're going to go to roughly in the first quarter. So I think what we're doing is prudently reacting to a little bit more difficult environment. I think we've done -- at least, maybe just me, my perception of this, but we've done a very good job just closely managing OpEx to make sure that it doesn't get away from us while revenue is coming off. So I think in the rest of the year, we'll manage it very closely. And Jerry mentioned a number of actions we're taking in the first quarter. We'll continue to look at it every quarter and not allow it to escalate until we see a big recovery on the revenue side. Jerald G. Fishman I think the other perspective on that is that if you look at the OpEx over the last 2 years, for last year -- and I mean our OpEx is the same now, on a running rate basis, as it was 2 years ago. And one of those years had a lot of growth and one had declined. So I think what -- the way we're looking at it, it's hard to look at these things quarter-to-quarter because the revenues fluctuate a great deal. But I think we had very significant operating expense controls in the company, and that the evidence of that is that the operating expenses through a lot of different parts of the cycle have been flat for the last 2 years, roughly. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division For the first question, you had mentioned about the variable comp and how that'll be a little bit lower, or the threshold to have it kick in would be a little bit higher. In general, should we think of it at a given level of revenues now, you're going to have a lower level of OpEx, I guess is the first clarification? Then the second part of the question is with the shutdowns that you're having in the January quarter, what sort of OpEx increase should we look at in the April quarter, assuming the shutdowns don't repeat themselves? David A. Zinsner Yes, the shutdown is relatively modest. It's a couple of million dollars. And I think we have pretty good control over the OpEx; that we won't allow it to go up, unless the revenues start to grow. And even if it does grow, it'll grow at a fairly modest rate. At a given revenue level, there are some other things that kind of crept in that offset some of the decline mostly on the variable comp piece. So some of it's awash and I think OpEx, we're generally trying to get the business to operate in kind of the low 30s, 30% to 31%, 32% of revenue, and that's what we're kind of target to get back to as business kind of grows. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Great. And I guess as my one follow-up, on the cash flow side of the equation. Can you remind us what your expectations are for CapEx in the first quarter and then for the full fiscal year '13? David A. Zinsner We're targeting to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million for the first quarter. We have a general goal to be in the kind of $100 million to $125 million for the year. It obviously depends on how the business operates. If it -- if we see more of a flattish environment, we'll probably be more towards the $100 million. If things start to grow a bit, we'll probably be closer to $125 million. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao of Bank of America. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division My question, Dave, typically ADI's gross margins are more a function of utilization rates than product mix. But you noted the analogous mix due to the shift towards consumer. Could you help quantify the impact of both these factors on the gross margin softness in both 4Q and fiscal first quarter? David A. Zinsner Relative to the prior quarter or? Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Yes. David A. Zinsner I'd say most of the margin shift from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is going to be loading related. Very little of it's going to be related to mix. It'll be slightly beneficial actually the mix. But given that industrial will be down, kind of roughly what the corporate average is down, we're expecting that mix won't be a big factor. So that's fairly, for the most part, mostly loading related. The gross margin shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was pretty much a 50-50 split between mix and loading. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay, cool. And then one question, Jerry, I wanted to talk about one of the businesses that doesn't get much attention, and that's the DSPs. And your DSP sales have held up fairly well for the last several years and have outperformed your large competitors' embedded division, where sales are down 10% to 15% over the last year. What do you think are some of the reasons why your DSPs are holding up better? And any color on that would be helpful. Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think one reason, I believe, is that we have our -- we don't look at DSP as a sort of separate business on to itself. We're a signal processing company. We look to gear our DSPs towards integration of digital and analog signal processing into more integrated solutions for our customers. I think that selling stand-alone DSPs, and we've talked about that with investors a couple of years ago, is a very, very tough strategy in the market right now. So the real value of DSP for us -- I mean we still sell plenty of individual DSPs, but we also -- and the thing that's really kept it at the levels we need is we're able, from a market segment and a customer standpoint, to provide more complete solutions of analog and DSP together. And that gives us a great advantage relative to most other players in the market. The DSP business is -- we've gotten down to the right expense levels. And I think the group that manages that business have done a pretty good job at doing that, commensurate with what we see the opportunity to be. But we see many, many applications that have developed and will develop in the future, where integrating DSP and analog, very high performance analog together, provides a very compelling solution to our customers. Do you have any other comments on that Vince? Vincent T. Roche Yes, just maybe one other piece of color. In terms of the predominance of the segments in that DSP product revenue basis, really industrial, which is very steady, it's very, very diverse in terms of the number of customers that we serve. And we've also -- in terms of raw growth driver, automotive has been the primary push there. So they're the 2 primary markets that comprise the sales of DSP. And we're pretty well matched, I think, with both of them in terms of the, as Jerry said, a more standard product approach in the industrial space and a more targeted match between our DSP and analog technologies in more complete solutions in automotive. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division If I could follow up, Jerry, on your comment about -- I think you called the order pattern increasingly more cautious. Was that a function of orders went down a lot in the beginning of the quarter and then stabilized? Or did you see a steady decline in the orders over the course of the quarter and into the month of November? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we saw the orders decrease early in the quarter and they did sort of stabilize at those levels for the rest of the quarter. I mean that's the general trend we saw, and I think I'd make the same comments about November. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then you made the comment that you thought an industrial -- a recovery in the industrial segment was more likely in Q2 versus Q1. Is that a function of seasonality or what your customers are telling you? Or was there anything to read into that? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it's all those things. It's that in Q1 for us, particularly with -- the industrial business is 16,000 customers or something out there. So there's a lot of customers that shut down. It's really a days of sale business for part of that in the broad base, and key account business with the large accounts. So typically, what we see in first quarter and given that there's less sales days is we see a decline in the first quarter. And we see a rebound in the second quarter since it's a quarter that's fully -- that's every day and every week are being worked by our customers. Also, I think given the inventory levels that the distributors are carrying and the customers are carrying, I mean and the amount that our industrial business is down relative to where it was, I mean just -- it's got to snap back. The only question is when it's going to happen. And if historical is a good representation of the future, which in the absence of any information, it is, we could see a snapback in that business in the second quarter. That's what we saw last year when the first quarter was down quite a bit. And in the absence of any other information, at least that's the planning assumption that we have right now in running the business. Now... James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Very helpful. Jerald G. Fishman I mean planning assumptions are just assumptions. But that's our assumption. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just a quick follow-up on the bookings question that Jim asked. Is there any sort of common theme or common reason why your customers are telling you that the bookings are falling off? Is it pure inventory? Is it demand? Is it a combination? Is anybody mentioning anything about the fiscal cliff or any other economic problems? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it's all those things. I mean you go out to see the large customers and it was interesting this morning, there was -- the CEO of Honeywell was on TV, or yesterday or something. And he's sort of indicative of the kind of things that we're hearing from customers that their business levels are not dead. They're relatively stable. Some are even forecasting some growth next year, but there's so much uncertainty out there. In Europe and the United States, based on the same things about government tax policy, all of the stuff that's going on in the economies, that people are just standing still, and that impacts their capital spending budget, in a similar way to it's impacting the capital spending budget in Analog Devices, that at the margin, people just stop spending money until they can get some certainty. And that's just not rhetoric, that's what CEOs around the world are doing right now. But the part that's encouraging to us is that when we visit those companies, #1, they're really, really excited about our technology; #2, they want deeper levels of engagement with Analog as a technology provider and a partner, and they're saying that their businesses are not declining and they're either stable or getting just a little bit better. So all those things say there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that business that a good dose of courage out there in the political environment wouldn't solve. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division And my follow-up is probably for Dave. Dave, do you remember when your utilization rates were this low? I think you guys said somewhere in the mid-50s, and what were your gross margins at the last time the utilization rates were this low? And do you have any figure on incremental gross margins as sales start to pick up? David A. Zinsner I think the last time we had utilization at this level was actually in 2009, so gross margins were in kind of the mid-50s. It was a little bit of a different environment, because we had a lot more capacity and business had really fallen off. Absent that, this is kind of an historic low for us outside of the period of time where it was really difficult. Usually, for every 10% improvement utilization, we get about 100 basis points of gross margin improvement. It can vary depending on -- based on mix and there's also loading that we get on the back end, which could be incrementally beneficial. So it has a little bit of a magnifying effect when business conditions improve. But on a rough order basis, I'd say it's at least 100 basis points. Operator Your next question comes from the line of P.J.  [C.J.] Muse of Barclays. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Yes, C.J. Muse. I guess, first question, I was hoping to dig a little bit deeper on the operating leverage side. And so I guess the first part, as you think about the higher threshold on incentive pay and some of the other actions that you're taking, what kind of incremental savings you would be thinking about looking into calendar '13? And then as a part of that, how should we think about your target in terms of what incremental operating margins should look like in a more normalized recovery period into calendar '13? David A. Zinsner Well, we're roughly saving probably in the neighborhood of $20 million a year with the new bonus structure and equivalent level because, of course, there are other things that go in different directions. I would -- if I were modeling OpEx, I think what I would model is a very carefully managed OpEx growth assuming business recovers in the second quarter, which is one scenario. And then if the business kind of continues to improve, we'll be fairly modest in our growth on OpEx. So we should see leverage on the OpEx side during a recovery. Our operating margins, when we were at kind of peak performance on a revenue basis, were up over the 35% level. I think at its peak, we were up above 37%. And assuming we get back to business levels like that, our operating margins will be at similar levels. It's just a matter of dependent on when the revenue kind of moves in it in that direction. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division That's very helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up, in terms of the 18% tax rate guide for fiscal '13, I guess, what has changed to enable that to be lower? Are you assuming a greater mix outside of the U.S.? Or is that a tax strategy on your part or reduced expectations for fiscal '13 top line? David A. Zinsner Yes, we're assuming a similar mix of income domestically versus internationally and internationally within each region. This really has to do with just some tax planning that goes on all the time. And some of the benefit of that tax planning is showing up in next year's numbers, at least we expect it to. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Where do you think LTE could be as a percent of mix 1 year from now? I understand it's probably still below 10% currently. And any views on the trends within infrastructures, specifically between base station and small cell? Vincent T. Roche Yes, the -- I would say in the second half of '12, the proportion of our wireless infrastructure business that was LTE or 4G was around 15%. Now I think as we get to the second half of FY '13, that number will probably move to 25% of total. And given that we have increased content to the tune of 20%, 30% depending on the customer from 3G to 4G, that should bode well in terms of revenue upside for the company. Let me see, your second question was regarding? Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Base station, small cell opportunities. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Well, I think the thing to remember when you look at macro versus small cell, both are going to exist -- co-exist in the network. And our expectation is that macro will continue to grow. That's what our customers tell us. That's what the carriers tell us. And basically, to help densify the network, to fill a network out, particularly in terms of being able to supply data needs in urban environments, what we'll see is a pretty steep increase in the deployment of small cell. So what we're looking at is a homogenized network that will have coexistence of macro and small, more point-to-point units and obviously more backhaul optical and cable networking as well as to be able to support the movement of data worldwide. So that's pretty much it as we see it. So I think what you'll see is a huge increase in the number of radios that get deployed. And what we sell into the small cell area is a trickle-down from what we develop for macro cell and have been developing for many, many years now. So there's tremendous leverage as small cell becomes more prevalent in the network. Jerald G. Fishman I think just one color comment on that is that the ADI content in 4G is quite a bit higher than it is in 3G. Ali Husain So we have a number of people still waiting to ask questions. If we're unable to get your question within the allotted time, you can reach me after the call at  461-3282, but we will continue and try to get to all the calls that we can. So before we take the last few questions, I'd like to mention that our first quarter 2013 earnings release is scheduled for February 19, 2013, after market close and our conference call will begin at approximately 5 p.m. Eastern Time that same day. So we're ready to take the additional questions now. Operator, may we have the next caller please? Operator Your next question comes from the line of the Doug Freedman of RBC. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division One, could you guys give us a look at sort of the real-time business conditions? I imagine lead times are low right now. And could you give us an idea of what the demand looks like for the month of December, given we're about to start that month? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that would sort of be predicting the future, which I mean we're not -- I mean we don't know what demand's going to be in December. We're cautious, particularly in the industrial business because there'll be a lot of shutdowns, as I mentioned earlier. So I think -- our sense and our internal plan is to just treat Q1 and be very, very cautious about what's going to happen because of the holiday period and all the things I mentioned earlier. So we'll have to just wait and see what happens in December. We just don't know. Vincent T. Roche On the lead time side of the story, we're shipping within 6-week lead times. We're shipping virtually 99% of the entire portfolio to on-time customer requests. Jerald G. Fishman I think the important thing that we're communicating around Analog and I think is worth mentioning tonight is that in the last cycle, when we managed the inventory well, we managed our capacity well and we did very, very well on the upside relative to many of our competitors, who got stuck and couldn't deliver stuff. So I think that's the mantra around Analog is that whatever we do -- and we know we can't predict demand, particularly in these tumultuous environments. But the one thing we can do and that we will do is make sure that we have supply when customers need it, and that's what we're going to do. So we just can't predict in the short term what's going to happen in any month or any week or any -- it's even hard to predict exactly what's going to happen in first quarter. And that's why the guidance range is so wide, and there's so many different factors that would enter into it. Now that's very typical in these cycles because customers know they don't have to give you a lot of lead time, so most of the business again is turns business. It's just the way it is. It's been like that, as you know, for 100 years. It will be like that for the next 100 years. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division All right. Jerry and Vince, I'm sorry, I'm a little confused by that answer, because if lead times are 6 weeks, you would have visibility for the month of December, and that's what I was asking for. I wasn't asking for... Jerald G. Fishman Are you talking about shipments... Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division I was asking for what you're seeing. Jerald G. Fishman Are you asking about shipments in December or orders in December? Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Shipments, what you're seeing from a demand perspective for shipments in the month of December. Jerald G. Fishman I think what we're seeing is commensurate with the guidance that we've provided for December. We don't see anything anomalous to the guidance we've provided. That's how we sort of calculate the guidance. The only -- what I was commenting on is the order rate, not the shipment rate. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Okay, understood. If I could, for my follow-up, Jerry, if we look back at the year and we go out to the 30,000-foot level, this cycle was not like any that we've seen in any of the past semiconductor cycles. Can you offer some of your commentary on what you think changed over the last year or 2 that has made it that we really didn't end up with what we would call a normal inventory cycle this year, only really seeing 1 seasonal quarter this whole year? Jerald G. Fishman I know, it's confusing, at best. The -- most of the cycles in the semiconductor business are and over many, many years have been based more on supply than demand. And there's always -- the semiconductor industry is always trying to catch up either to the upturn or the downturn and always misses it. So, so many of the cycles are based on just what's low -- how much capacity's there, shortages, double, triple ordering and then a reaction to that. And those cycles, were pretty straightforward and we've seen those many, many times. I think the big difference in this cycle that we've seen is just staggering uncertainty in the customer base, based on partly economic conditions, but also policy issues and tremendous uncertainty of what people are going to do about capital spending, which partially is related to their business levels, but is also related so nobody can figure out what's going to happen in those areas of policy. So I think that that's the difference in this cycle, that I think -- which is why it got shortened from what we'd normally see, why it was very, very to predict in the short term what's going to happen. I continue to believe if the uncertainty gets cleared up and people sort of understand the environment, whatever it is, good, bad or different, I think things will get better. That's our -- that's our sense of what's going on with the market based on what our largest customers and the senior executives at our largest customers are telling us. It's not just an internal theory of Analog. We spend a lot of time out there talking at very senior levels particularly to our industrial customers. And that's what they're telling us, so that's what I believe. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda from ISI. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division [indiscernible] about quantitatively on the turns required for the quarter? Is it similar to what you registered in the October quarter, or higher, lower? David A. Zinsner I think you cut off just a little bit, Sumit. But basically, we don't typically quote turns. We don't even calculate them internally, just because a lot of our backlog is associated with orders from distributors, which don't translate into revenue until the distributors ship out the product to their end customers. But I think it's -- just qualitatively, I think it's safe to say that we're in a high-turns environment with limited backlog going into the quarter. And that's been relatively consistent over the last few quarters. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then maybe just some more detail on the consumer outlook for the January quarter. Is the big hit that you're taking in call it the audio business or the imaging business? Or is it not distinguishable in terms of the impact from one versus the other in the January quarter? Vincent T. Roche Well, we've multiple segments or subsegments under the consumer banner, and we typically see a seasonality decline in the 15% to 20% area. So what you're going to see this particular quarter is something similar. It's going to be all the segments and there's nothing really anomalous there. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Steve Smigie. Just with regard to your comments about your -- I guess, your wireless infrastructure business, you said that you expect them to be more meaningful towards the end of 2013. And I'm just wondering, is that suggesting there's going to be some softness sort of in the middle of the year? Or is there -- are there some specific programs you expect to ramp in 2013 that makes it specifically stronger? It's just your comments on Vincent T. Roche Yes, my comment on the infrastructure and comparing the second half of '12 to the second half of '13 is really in relation to the proportion of our business that is 4G, which I expect to increase and ramp during FY '13. So that was really the comment there more so than the particular order of demand patterns across the infrastructure market in general. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis of Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, I just wanted to take a step back and look a little bit longer term. As you look out over the course of 2013 calendar and you think about the underlying dynamics in ADI's different businesses, industrial communications, auto, et cetera, and the products that you have and the programs that you're involved in, where do you feel most confident that ADI can drive year-on-year growth in the coming year? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's a real challenging question, given where we are and where we're coming from. So I think in each of the areas, in each of the market segments that are now strategically important to us, industrial and automotive and communications and even parts of the consumer market where we could add real value, I mean we're expecting that each of those is going to get better through the year. We'll see how it goes. We're starting off at a very low level, but I think in the long term, there are certain market segments, as I mentioned, that we're committed to strategically that we think we can change the user experience, get paid for what we do. Customers value us. I think those are the segments we're investing in. Ones that we've come to a conclusion, don't meet those criteria, we don't invest. I think we've shown that over the years and I think each year we go back and reassess what's the good, what's the bad, what's the ugly and we made changes in the portfolio mix each year, and sometimes more frequently. So it's very hard sitting where we're sitting today to say which of the segments are going to drive growth. I mean each of the segments has great opportunities. The real question is how does the market unfold during the year? Mostly on the economics side rather than on what product we have side. I think we're very confident about the product portfolio we have and the relations we have with our customers. For that part, we're consistently and increasingly confident about it. Just you just can't predict what's going to happen with aggregate business levels and sentiment out there, and that's the confusing thing out there. In the absence of that, we'd be very aggressive about what we could achieve in 2013. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And then the follow-up for Dave. Dave, channel inventories are at below normal levels. As you think about where you'd like to manage them in a more normalized environment, how should we think about where inventories would likely normalize as we move through the year next year? David A. Zinsner Well, the inventories that I mentioned are down kind of close to 7 weeks, which is definitely below our target levels. I think we'd like to see them be more in the range of 7.5 to 8 weeks. And, I think, probably, we'll be at the lower end of that, certainly, in the early part of the year. But as we kind of push forward through the year, I would expect us to normalize back to that level. Ali Husain So we are -- we still have a few callers here. So we'll keep going. Operator, can we have the next caller please? Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu of UBS. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division First of all on automotive, you -- if we look back at calendar 2011, you were growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. That settled down and now it looks to go negative. Should we think of a rebound as we go through the coming fiscal year back to the 20%-plus type growth rate? Or was there something unique in terms of an inventory build or a set of end products that aren't necessarily selling as well going forward? Vincent T. Roche Well, the automotive business has grown very fast in the company over the past 5 years. In the last 3 years, the compounded growth rate is somewhere in the region of 14% or 15%. And automotive is now a much bigger portion of ADI's revenue. It's a bigger number. But I would say the way to look at this thing is that the growth impact is more about the market and declining or muted car sales more so than the adoption of the technology. If anything, I would say the rate of designing of our products across the 3 areas of safety, powertrain and infotainment, is stronger than ever. We're penetrating in regions, our customers in Asia, now that we have not been so successful as in the past in a completely different way now, which bodes very well for the future. So my sense is it's more really about the market demand at the consumer level rather than demand for ADI products. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, in the base station market, you talked about a 20% to 30% content increase as we go to LTE. I'm trying to understand, is that a onetime increase in content, because it is showing in your growth rate? Or is there something more long-term secular increase in content as we go to LTE advanced and small cells as we look out to the middle of the decade? Vincent T. Roche Yes, between all of the evolution from generation to generation from 2G, to 3G, to 4G, we've typically seen a 20% to 40% increase in the value of the products we sell into those applications, partly because the complexity or sophistication of the products we're providing is greater. The performance increases from generation to generation. And also, we've been expanding our footprints in the -- in all these radio applications. So for example, we're providing a lot more radio frequency technology than we did say 5 or 6 years ago. We're beginning to meaningfully deploy clocking technology as well for timing generation and control. In areas like cable and optical infrastructure, we've a tremendous market share and growing in observation and control circuits. So I think it's really -- it's a function of the complexity of the products commanding a better ASP and also ADI expanding our bond footprint in each of the applications. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster of Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Dave, on the change in the tax structure, does that have any impact on your operating cash flow that's generated domestically? And can you remind us what that is? David A. Zinsner It does not have any impact on our cash flow for domestic cash flow. It's a -- runs -- it can vary depending on the quarter. But it's probably -- on a rough order, probably about 1/3 of the total cash flow is generated in the U.S. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. And then on the military part of the business, can you remind us how much of that is -- it is as a percent of sales and what your outlook is for there? David A. Zinsner It's marginal; it's in the mid-single digits. Vincent T. Roche Yes, it's about -- it's roughly about 6% to 7% of the company's revenue depending on when you measure. And it's been relatively steady over the past year. Ali Husain Great. So that concludes our Q&amp;A session. A couple of folks that we will get to after the call. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again during our first quarter 2013 earnings call scheduled for February 19, 2013, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time. Thank you very much. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices' conference call. You may now disconnect.   Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

McAdam - Executive Vice President of The Strategic Market Segments Group Thomas Wessel - Vice President of Worldwide Sales   Analog Devices Inc.  Annual Meeting of Shareholders March 13, 2013 9:00 AM ETMargaret K. Seif Good morning, everyone. It is 9:00 and we're ready to begin our Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Analog Devices. My name is Margaret Seif, I'd like to welcome everyone here today joining us at our corporate headquarters and also those of you listening via the web. Please note that rules of conduct and procedure apply to this meeting and are available in the voting area over there if you wish to inspect them. Our agenda today will begin with prepared remarks from our Chairman, Ray Stata. We'll then proceed to the formal meeting, and we will conclude with remarks by our CEO, Jerry Fishman. So without further delay, I'd like to introduce ADI Co-Founder and Chairman of the Board, Ray Stata. Ray Stata Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you, Marnie, for the introduction. And I'd like to add my welcome to those who come to our 2013 Annual Stockholders Meeting. I'll begin by introducing the corporate officers who are with us today. First, Vincent Roche, the President of Analog Devices. Vincent, I think -- particularly take -- make note of the fact that I'm sure all of you seen that Vincent was promoted to President this past year, and he's taken a lot of new responsibilities, and along with him, a number of others in the senior management ranks, who are promoted to share the load, and Jerry is going to talk a bit about -- more about that in his remarks. Also here is David Zinsner, our Vice President of Finance and Chief Technical Officer; Sam Fuller, Vice President of Research and Development and our Chief Technical Officer; Bill Matson, Vice President of Human Resources; Robbie McAdam, Executive Vice President of our Strategic Business Segments Group; and Dick Meaney, Vice President of our Products and Technology Group; and Marnie Seif, Vice President, General Manager and Secretary -- General Counsel, I should say; Thomas Wessel, Vice President of Sales; and Robert Yung, Vice President of Corporate Development and Chief Strategic Officer; and finally, Jerry Fishman, our CEO. I'd also like to just introduce the Board of Directors who are with us today: Jim Champy; John Hodgson -- Jim, John Hodgson; Yves-Andre Istel; Neil Novich; Grant Saviers; Paul Severino; Ken Sicchitano. And I'd also like to extend a special welcome to Lisa Su, who joined us last year as our newest director. Lisa has a distinguished record of leadership both in the managerial and the technical arena and a long career at both Freescale, IBM, and more recently, at AMD where she is the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Global Business Units. So Lisa joined us in June of 2012 and is serving on our -- as a member of our nominating and governance committee, and we're pleased that she's sitting for election here today. Next, I'd like to introduce to you our independent auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, and we're asking our shareholders today to ratify the selection of Ernst &amp; Young as our auditors for 2013, and representing EY here today is Michael Terrell [ph]. And finally, I'd like to introduce Mark Borden, a long friend of Analog Devices, our General Counsel from Wilmer Hale. So before we begin the formal part of our meeting today, I wanted to mention just a few of the highlights for 2012. First, in April of last year, Analog's stock began trading on the NASDAQ, which I think is now recognized throughout the world as the leading exchange for innovative high-technology companies. In December of last year, Analog Devices was added to the NASDAQ 100, which is an index of the largest NASDAQ companies rated by their market cap. Our market cap today stands at about $14 billion. If you happened to be in New York -- in Time Square last week, you may have seen our logo, up on the iconic NASDAQ tower. Here's what you would have seen. [Presentation] Ray Stata So we -- Dave tried very hard to get them to play that on New Year's Eve, but somehow he failed. So the other thing I'd point out is that in 2012, Analog was named a top 100 innovator by Thomson Reuters. This is the second time that Analog has been so recognized, and that's quite a distinguished recognition because it's done on the basis of rather thorough examination of what qualifies for that amongst many, many thousands of firms. In 2012, we were also published -- we also published our sustainable report, the third one we reported, which chronicles Analog's leadership in environmental health and safety stewardship. We achieved the highest score amongst all the Analog semiconductor companies for the quality of our disclosures and for our performance on the actions taken to mitigate air, water and climate impact. So Analog's score rose to 76 in 2012, up from 49 the year before. We were also honored as one of America's greenest companies, again, for the third consecutive year by BusinessWeek. And moreover, Forbes Magazine reported that Analog Devices was named to the top 25 list of socially responsible dividend paying stocks. So all in all in many ways, 2012 was a very successful year for Analog Devices, for our employees, our customers, our stockholders, for everyone, and I'd like to just congratulate the team and all of our employees for the outstanding job that they did once again in maintaining our leadership in the high-performance, surreal world signal processing industry. Thank you. Margaret K. Seif Okay. So we'll now have the formal part of the meeting, where we take the votes on the matters described in our proxy statement. Once all of the votes are taken, we will adjourn the meeting, and afterwards, our CEO, Jerry Fishman will make a presentation and answer any appropriate questions you may have. As indicated in the notice of meeting and proxy statement that we mailed to our shareholders, we're here today to consider and vote on the following business items: The election of our directors; the compensation of our named executive officers; the approval of our executive section 162 Plan; and the ratification of Ernst &amp; Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2013. We will consider each item in turn today. The polls for each matter being voted on at this meeting will open when the matter is called to a vote, and will remain open until I announce that the polls are closed. No ballots or proxies or revocations or changes will be accepted after the polls are closed and we will announce the results of the voting on each proposal immediately following the tabulation of voting. I received an affidavit from Broadridge Financial Solutions, certifying that the notice of Annual Meeting and proxy statement were sent to all shareholders of record as of January 11, 2013. This affidavit is available for inspection by any shareholder in the voting area. Are there any shareholders present here today who wish to vote in person? If so, raise your hands. If you want to, there are ballots over here. I've been informed by Broadridge that there are present at this meeting in person or by proxy, a majority of the outstanding and issued shares of common stock entitled to vote on each of the proposals described in the notice of meeting. So a quorum exists with respect to each proposal. The first matter for our shareholders to vote on is the election of 10 directors for a term of 1 year to expire at the 2014 Annual Meeting. The nominees for election are: Ray Stata, Jerald Fishman, James Champy, John Hodgson, Yves-Andre Istel, Neil Novich, Grant Saviers, Paul Severino, Ken Sicchitano, and Lisa Su. So any discussion on this motion before we vote? Okay, we'll now vote. The next matter for the shareholders to vote on is a nonbinding say on pay vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers described in our proxy statement. Is there any discussion on this motion before we vote today? So we will now proceed to a vote. The next matter for the shareholders to vote on is approval of our executive 162 Plan as described in our proxy statement. Is there any discussion on this motion today before we vote? Okay, we'll now vote. And the final matter for our shareholders to vote on is the ratification of the selection of Ernst &amp; Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year ending November 2, 2013. Is there any discussion on this motion before we vote today? We will now vote. This concludes the business items on the agenda for this Annual Meeting. If you have not yet voted and would like to do so, you may proceed to the voting area now. Hearing nothing, I will ask, have the ballots been collected? Unknown Attendee Yes. Margaret K. Seif The polls are now closed. And we will have a report of the preliminary results of today's voting. Unknown Attendee On the motion to elect the 10 nominees as directors of Analog Devices, each of the nominees has received a majority of the votes cast in favor of their election. On the motion to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, a majority of the total number of votes cast has been voted in favor of this proposal. On the motion to approve our executive section 162 Plan, a majority of the total number of votes cast has been voted in favor of this proposal. And finally, on the motion to ratify the selection of Ernst &amp; Young as our independent registered public accounting firm, a majority of the votes -- a majority of the total number of votes cast has been voted in favor of this proposal. Margaret K. Seif Thank you. As a result of the voting, each of the nominees has been elected a director. The compensation of our named executive officers has been approved. Our Analog Devices executive section 162 Plan has been approved and Ernst &amp; Young has been ratified as our independent auditor for 2013. Following certification of today's voting, the final results on each proposal will be filed with the SEC, and will be posted on our website at www.analog.com within 4 business days. There being no further business to come before the meeting, I'm going to adjourn the formal part of the meeting. But before I turn this meeting over to Jerry Fishman, please note, here comes the sexy part, the various remarks that may be made about future expectations, plans, projections and prospects for ADI constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by those forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section included in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which is on file with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent expectations only as of today. While we may elect to update these statements, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. Any forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our estimates or views as of any date after today. Our comments today may also make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP items to their most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our first quarter earnings release, which was issued February 19, 2013, and a copy of that is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at analog.com. Thank you for your attention and attendance. Please enjoy this brief video while we prepare the podium for Mr. Fishman. Jerry will deliver his remarks, and then answer any appropriate questions you may have. [Presentation] Jerald G. Fishman Well, good morning. For those old timers that have come to the meeting for many years, this used to take us about 10 days of preparation and 160 slides to explain so this is a lot better. So it shows how far the technology has really come. One thing I'd like to add my good morning to the welcome that Ray provided earlier this morning to our Annual Shareholders Meeting. I think as you can see from the brief video clip, the impact of ADI's technology on so many different applications is really profound. We're helping our customers develop advancements in electronics that are making this world we all live in safer, faster, greener, smarter and better in so many ways. It turns out it's a very, very exciting time to be in Analog Devices, and the opportunities for the kinds of products and the kind of technology that we have at Analog is really in many ways endless. We're, of course -- we're not immune-ed from the external environment that we all have to live in, and in our 2012, the economy was in tough shape. It was very uncertain and it was difficult in most regions in the world and that certainly impacted the whole semiconductor industry and we're naturally part of that. But even with all those headwinds in 2012, we did manage to capture the opportunities that were in front of us and we gained even more focus on our business on the things that we really want to do and that we're very good at doing. Our success, really, is driven by 3 very, very simple differentiators. First, we have a very focused strategy, and we don't divert from it. We have a very clear sense of purpose of what makes Analog unique in the eyes of our customers. And I think we're also blessed with a very strong and experienced leadership of some of the most creative and talented and innovative people in the entire analog industry. Our strategy at Analog in simple terms is to focus on markets, customers and applications that have the potential, the real potential, to grow at a faster rate than the overall semiconductor market. In these areas, we target most of our resources to solve the most difficult signal processing challenges by providing game-changing technology and world-class service and reliability and quality to our large group of customers. In what has turned out to be over the last 10 or 15 years an incredibly volatile industry, our strategy allows us to consistently generate very strong profitability and very strong cash flow in good years and also in bad years. With the very robust margins we earned, we're able to maintain very high levels of R&amp;D investment to feed the cycle of innovation in Analog that has lasted now for almost 45 years, and allows us to continue to provide our customers with the breakthroughs that they need to continue their market leadership. Importantly, our returns that we get also allow us to continue to enhance the returns that we're able to provide to our shareholders. The strength of our business strategy was clearly evident in 2002 -- in 2012 rather, which was a year in which massive reductions in capital spending in the industrial market and the communications infrastructure market really did limit the opportunities available for companies like Analog Devices. For those who've been with Analog many years, I think you might remember that capital spending in both either communications or industrial products is really the main driver of our business. It has been that for many years and it continues to be that. So when industrial or capital spending -- industrial capital spending goes down, our business tends to go down. And when infrastructure and industrial capital spending go up, we react very quickly to that, and I think this cycle will prove that to be the case again. But yet, despite all the pressures that we had in 2012 and all the uncertainty that we experienced through the year, we did manage to generate $2.7 billion in revenues. We did manage to generate 64.5% gross margins, and our operating margins were about just over 30% for the year, which I think most companies would be very proud of no matter what the economics were in the world. Importantly, also, we generated very strong cash flow in 2012. We generated over $815 million with 30% of sales and operating cash flow, and free cash flow was just under $700 million with almost 25% of sales, which are very strong statistics, again, by virtually any measure. The cash generation capability in Analog has provided the opportunity to consistently improve our shareholder returns. In 2012, we repurchased approximately $160 million of our common stock. This brings our cumulative repurchases since we began our share repurchase program back in 2004, about 8 or 9 years ago, to a cumulative total of $4.4 billion, which represents just under 130 million shares of our stock that we bought back. In 2012, we also increased our quarterly dividend by 20% over the previous year, and we paid out $345 million in dividends to our shareholders. Since the first dividend was paid around 2004, I believe was the first year we paid the dividend, almost 10 years ago, Analog has increased our dividend 10x and has paid out $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. So in total, between share repurchases and dividends, we've returned over $6 billion to our shareholders since this program began. As a result of the performance that we've had, also, what we see is increasing confidence amongst most of our large shareholders and our long-term prospects. Our total shareholder return last year, which is the sum of stock price appreciation plus dividends was approximately 10% for the year, and that certainly is at the high-end of what any of our peers produced last year. In addition, since 2007, as you can see on the chart, we've outperformed the cumulative shareholder return of the S&amp;P 500 Index and also the S&amp;P Semiconductor Index. So it just really shows that if you do the right things and get the right returns, you get rewarded by your shareholders. I think this chart is very stark evidence of that. But certainly, without a very clear sense of purpose, these results simply would not be achievable. For ADI, our mission has remained the same for many, many years, and that is to be the world's best and most innovative signal processing company. Yet, how we achieve this mission continues to evolve over time according to the changing market dynamics and the changing needs of many of our largest customers. A foundational and very critical element of what we do has always been, and I think will always continue to be, the development of game changing core technology. We focus on technology innovations and converters and linear products and radio frequency products and micro-machine products and power products and DSP. And those products create competitive advantage and maintain our reputation for outstanding service and quality and reliability as well. Together, these technologies and the products on those technologies have strengthened our position as the very best brand with our broad base of tens of thousands of customers around the world that buy our products. We then leverage those technologies into more market-driven integrated solutions that our largest customers need to innovate, of course, a very diverse set of applications, many of which you saw on the video, such as smart energy grids, smart phones, advanced automotive safety, fuel efficiency systems, high bandwidth communications, nonintrusive medical diagnostics and patient monitoring applications and robotics and industrial controls in most of the factories of the future. While the path to our missions continue to change, our internal environment remains mostly the same as it's been for many years. ADI remains a place where the most talented technologist come together to explore new ideas, to learn from the best in class that work for Analog Devices, and ultimately, many of them choose to build their entire career at Analog Devices, and we hope that continues into the future. That's certainly what has made us successful for over 45 years and has allowed us to develop a portfolio and an institutional knowledge base in our business that today remains simply unmatched by any other competitor. This very deep and experienced team we have at Analog has also provided us with a very strong bench to develop the next generation leaders for Analog Devices. And in 2012, as Ray mentioned in some of his earlier comments, we promoted a number of long-term ADI executives to take on increased responsibility in our new organization. First and certainly most importantly, Vince Roche, who has been with Analog for 24 years, he's a youngster at Analog, was promoted to be the President of Analog Devices. Vince and I have worked together for many, many years, for a couple of decades, and I have always found him to be an enormously talented executive, who knows our business exceptionally well, in his insights in both the technologies that we develop and the markets that we serve and also he's built relationships with the largest customers around the world in virtually every location. Vince used to run our sales organization. He also ran our market segment organization so he had ample chance to really understand what's going on with most of our customers. And now, in his new role, apply that understanding to the markets we serve and the products that we develop. Also, in 2012, we promoted another short-term Analoger, Robbie McAdam, how many years is that Robbie? Robert P. McAdam 29. Jerald G. Fishman 29. To lead our market segment strategies, which I alluded to a little earlier, which is the way we take our core technology and pick the places where customers want more integrated and more whole solutions to their products, and Robbie's institutional experience and the knowledge he has of our customers and our products, and the markets is really truly unique, and we're fortunate to have somebody of that capability to do that job. Also, Ray mentioned, Dick Meany, who's now heading up all our product development at ADI, which is one challenging job. One of the hallmarks at Analog for many years has always been it was very -- we had that responsibility diffused through the organization, and we had at onetime 73 product lines, all of which were making their own decisions, and if they ever converged with a customer, it was because God was looking at us favorably. And now, with the pace of technology development that's going on and the urgency to get the right products to the right customers at the right time, this is an enormous responsibility and I've always had a great deal of respect for Dick in terms of his ability to manage R&amp;D in the company. And Dick asked for this job and he got it. So whatever complaints you have, Dick, it's not my fault. So I think Dick will really make a huge difference of being able to move technology from one area to another to get the true benefit of the scale of Analog's R&amp;D investments and capability in many, many businesses around Analog. I think that's going to be a big improvement for us. And also, we promoted Thomas Wessel to be Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Thomas came to us many years ago from our friends down in Dallas, Texas Instruments, and we've always had a great deal of respect for Texas Instruments' sales force, and Thomas, I'm not going to say anything more than that, and -- we are webcasting this, I guess, right? So I'll shut my mouth, and the -- I think Thomas brings a unique perspective of the real value of ADI's technology to our customers. Thomas, in his last job at Analog was very instrumental in building our automotive business up to now being nearly a $500 million business for us, and one of the fastest-growing business at Analog. So again, Thomas, he's a relative newcomer. How many years, Thomas? Thomas Wessel 10 years. Jerald G. Fishman 10 years. God, 10 years. And if he gets rid of that car and stops driving on the autobahn at a 110 miles an hour, I think he has a great future here. So I'm really convinced when you look at the people we have in place and the people that we're promoting. I'm convinced that we have both the skills and the organizational determination to take ADI to the next level over the next 5 to 10 years. As I said a few minutes ago, it's a very exciting time to be part of Analog Devices, whether you're an employee, whether you're a customer or whether you're a shareholder. Just recently, as part of our Analog -- our annual planning process, we began to take an even longer-term view of the strategic opportunities that are available for ADI. We've now extended the time dimension that we look at out to 5 and 7 and 10 years, and we realized as we did that, the tremendous wealth of opportunities for our technology that is available to Analog Devices in the next decade. As a result, I think we began 2013 with a lot of confidence that despite our great history and despite all the turmoil in the world still today, that Analog's best years are still ahead of us. So in closing, I'd like to thank everybody who's listening, all our employees around the world for coming into work every day, believing they can do what nobody else can do year after year, and that really helps us and invigorates us all to achieve the mission that we've set out for the company. And also, our loyal shareholders who have been with us through thick and thin through good years and bad, we have a great base of shareholders that are mostly long-term holders that believe in what we do and believe, and really find that what we do is credible and have stayed with us and continued to be large investors for Analog for many, many years. And I know over the years, that's been a straining exercise for some investors. So that's all I have to say this morning. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Tagliaferro, you may begin your conference. Maria Tagliaferro Thank you, operator. Today I'm participating in the call in my role as Corporate Communications Director. Running the ADI earnings calls from here forward will be Ali Husain. For those of you who haven't met him yet, Ali joined the team at the end of May as our new Director of Investor Relations. But he's actually been working at Analog Devices for the past 8 years or more -- a little more than 8 years. So he'll take over as moderator on the earnings call and as the primary contact for investor relations. But I look forward to continuing to work with our shareholders, and also welcome Ali to the team. Ali Husain Thanks, Maria. Good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be part of the team, and we appreciate you and everyone joining us for today's call. If listeners haven't yet seen our third quarter fiscal year 2012 press release or form 10-Q, both may be accessed through our website at investor.analog.com. This conference call is also accessible from the same page. A recording of this conference call will be available today within about 2 hours of this call's completion, it will remain available via telephone playback for a period of time and will also be archived on the IR website. In addition, we have updated the schedule on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;L for continuing operations, as well as historical quarterly and annual information for revenue from continuing operations by end market and product type. Participating in the meeting on today's call are Jerry Fishman, President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; Vincent Roche, Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Strategic Market Segments; and Maria Tagliaferro, Corporate Communications Director. During the first part of the call, Jerry and Dave will present our third quarter 2012 results as well as our short-term outlook. The remainder of the call will be devoted to answering questions from our analysts and investor participants. During today's call we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain nonrecurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website. I ask you to please note that the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on form 10-Q filed earlier today. The forward-looking information that's provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is August 21, 2012. And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, good afternoon to everybody, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 conference call. As you can tell from our press release this afternoon, our revenues totaled about $683 million, which was up about 1% from the previous quarter and down about 10% from the same quarter last year, and was just very slightly below our plan for the quarter, but well within the range that we communicated in May. Diluted earnings per share of $0.56 was at the midpoint of our earlier guidance. The good news is that despite economic headwinds and increasing uncertainty in most regions of the world, our business in aggregate remains stable during the quarter. Our bellwether industrial business which now comprises 47% of our revenues, was approximately flat to last quarter, remaining stable after growing very strongly in our Q2. Our largest industrial customers indicate to us that while their earlier growth expectations for 2012 have modulated in the past few months, they currently see very little deterioration in their business to date, and they don't expect any significant downturn for the balance of the year. Now these customers, the large industrial customers, were for the most part are on plan for the quarter. Our distribution channel, which primarily serves the industrial market, was consistent throughout the quarter and was stable in July. In fact in July, we saw stronger bookings on ADI from our distributors, indicating that while they too remain cautious, they don't foresee any deterioration in their business in the near term. These trends are very significant for ADI given the importance of the industrial market to our revenues and to our profits. Our communications infrastructure business grew 9% sequentially, driven by wireless customers that was in line with our expectations for new wireless base station deployments in the United States, in Asia and also in Japan. As I think you know, we're very well positioned with market-leading OEMs in Europe, in Asia and in the U.S. with a product portfolio that addresses both existing technology and also newer 4G deployments, which we will expect will increase ADI's content in those base stations. Automotive revenues decreased very slightly sequentially, but was up 12% over the same quarter last year. This was also slightly below our plan for the quarter as European manufacturers reduced production in the summer months in response to the uncertain economic environment and also lackluster car sales in Europe. Safety, including rollover control and radar-based collision avoidance systems, energy efficiency and infotainment all represent great growth opportunities for ADI, and we expect the automotive market to become increasingly attractive for us. Our consumer business was approximately flat sequentially, which was also slightly below our plan for the quarter. Growth in portable media offset declines in digital cameras, while other subsegments, such as home entertainment and also computing, remained approximately flat. The good news here is that our backlog for consumer products grew substantially during the quarter, which should provide good revenue growth for ADI in our fourth quarter. Order rates from our end customers remained solid during the third quarter and totaled approximately $700 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio that's greater than 1. We're generating an increasing amount of our sales from turns orders which are booked and shipped during the same quarter. This is typical in an uncertain environment and when our lead times continue to be very short. In aggregate, there did not appear to be a lot of market momentum in either a positive or negative direction. And in the short term, our revenues will be mostly dependent by the macro economy and to a lesser degree, new product cycles in certain end markets. In this environment, we believe we're doing a very credible job in responding to all the uncertainty. We continue to make trade-offs to focus our investments on the right products, the right markets and the right customers, to maximize our long-term growth rate. In general, our gross margins have remained very strong and our operating expenses are under very tight control, and we continue to generate significant operating cash flow, which gives us the flexibility to enhance returns to shareholders. And we would expect very strong operating leverage as macro conditions improve. So that's all I'm going to say in the opening comments. I'll turn it over to Dave now, who will take you through some of the details of our financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, third quarter revenue increased approximately 1% sequentially to $683 million. Our gross margin was 65.6% in the third quarter. This was up 40 basis points from the 65.2% we reported in the second quarter, driven by slightly higher utilization rates. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. Operating expenses for the third quarter, excluding approximately $5.8 million in restructuring-related expenses, were $230 million compared to about $228 million in the prior quarter. This slight dollar increase was primarily due to a full quarter's impact of the annual salary increases. We continue to be very watchful of operating expenses during this period of uncertainty and do not plan to grow expenses until we are confident that the economic headwinds have abated. Operating profits before tax for the third quarter, excluding restructuring related expenses, were $218 million or 32% of sales, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 19%, lower than the prior quarter's 23%. The lower rate was due to a change in estimates of our future tax liabilities and some discrete tax items. We expect our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 21% to 22% excluding any discrete tax item. Diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in the third quarter was at the midpoint of our guidance and up 6% sequentially from the prior quarter. We generated 20% of our revenue or $138 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $39 million, resulting in free cash flow of about $100 million or 14% of revenue for the quarter. While a strong result, third quarter operating cash was impacted by payments related to variable compensation and some income tax payments. Our expectations for the fourth quarter is for operating cash to be significantly stronger, in the range of its historical norms, upgraded in 30% of revenues. Our accounts receivable balance was up about $16 million versus the last quarter on higher sales, and our days sales outstanding remains roughly flat at 46 days. Inventory on our balance sheet increased by 3% or $8 million, and we have 121 days of inventory on hand. We have increased inventory to meet anticipated seasonal demand from our consumer customers in the second half of the calendar year, as well as to respond to a new product cycle. By the end of our fiscal first quarter of 2013, we expect the business to catch up to the inventory growth and as a result, days of inventory should be more in line with our model of 100 to 110 days. Inventory at distribution was approximately flat to last quarter and weeks of inventory and distribution remained flat at approximately 7.5 weeks, which is at the lower end of historical norms. During the third quarter, we repurchased $17 million of our stock. We also distributed approximately $90 million or 53% of net income in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash and short-term investments balance at the end of the third quarter was roughly flat to last quarter, with approximately $1 billion available domestically. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $857 million in debt outstanding. On August 20, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on September 12, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2012. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%. In addition, we have approximately $580 million remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program. We plan to continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock. Since the start of our share repurchase program in fiscal 2004, the company has repurchased approximately 129 million shares or $4.4 billion of company stock. In summary, third quarter delivered solid results during challenging times. Our operating model turned a 1% sequential increase in revenue into a 6% sequential increase in diluted earnings per share. At gross margins of 65.6% and operating margins of 32%, including any restructuring charges, we still have leverage ahead as sales increase, factory utilization improves and we continue to prudently control our operating expenses. And now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Thanks, Dave. Looking forward in the short term, we expect our industrial, communications and automotive businesses to remain stable in Q4 and be at similar revenue levels to Q3. In our consumer business, increased backlog and a strong product cycle lead us to plan for growth in Q4. In total, we expect our revenues to be in the range of $685 million to $715 million. We know, however, that our largest distributors have indicated a wide range of possible outcomes for their quarter ending in September, which reflects economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe. If our growth is mostly from consumer products in Q4 and reflecting what is now planned to be lower factory utilization, we'd expect our gross margins to be in the range of approximately 65%. We're planning for operating expenses to be roughly flat to last quarter. Based on these assumptions, we'd expect our diluted earnings in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.60. In the longer term, we remain enthusiastic for continuing very profitable growth and cash generation based on our better product mix, our customers' enthusiasm for working very closely with ADI to meet their toughest technical challenges and a highly competitive responses capability to meet whatever our customers ask us. In the long term, these attributes will determine our growth rate. But certainly in the short term, it will be mostly about the macro economy. Ali Husain Thank you, Jerry. Thank you, Dave. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we are now ready for questions from our participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Just the first one on gross margins, so you indicated obviously mix and lower utilizations as taking the margins down a little bit next quarter even on higher revenues. I know you said utilizations went up a little bit this quarter. Can you give me some feeling for exactly where they are this quarter? I think they were 70% last quarter. Where are they going next quarter? Are they dropping lower than they were, say, in Q2 when I think they were at 67%? And can you give us some feeling for additional margin drivers, I guess, as we go into the beginning of next fiscal 2013 on revenue levels that hopefully can begin to grow off of here? David A. Zinsner Utilization was a little bit north of 70% this quarter. And we're expecting it to be in the range of -- the quarter you cited, which was in the kind of high 60s for next quarter. And clearly, utilization will be one of the bigger factors in driving the gross margins up when we were running in the 80s, we had 67% gross margin. Some of that of course was due to mix but a fair amount of that was due to utilizations, so we'd expect as utilization does improve, our gross margins improve. Also we are in, I guess, a relatively tepid environment on the industrial side. We do expect over time, as the economy improves, that to pick up. That is our highest gross margin end market and should be accretive to gross margins as well. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. I think for us, Stacy, the encouraging thing is that even at these levels where we're forecasting a relatively strong consumer quarter relative to industrial and communications, and given the fact that utilization is -- we're going to keep pretty low to keep the inventories down, we can still run sort of 65-type gross margins is a lot different than it used to be, and a positive effect. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Helpful, guys. For my follow-up, a question on the common infrastructure space. So it was up this quarter, I think in line with your expectations. Lots of folks have been looking for the potential for bigger acceleration of that market in general into the back half of the year given some of the guidance that's out there right now for some of the carriers, but you seem to be guiding at flat. So it doesn't sound like -- it sounds like, I mean have we seen the list that we're going to see that in that market when we're done? Or do you think there's still the prospect for further growth next quarter maybe if we're going out another quarter to after that? Do you think that there's still opportunity for further growth in that market? Do you think that we're going to see pickups in carrier spend? And is this something -- are the current levels that we're seeing out there sustainable. Vincent T. Roche I think when you factor in the -- we have 2 components to our infrastructure business. We got the wireless component that's pretty dominant, about 2/3 of the overall revenue and in the infrastructure sector. And we've got a wired component as well. We've seen much stronger growth on the wireless side. And in spite of the fact that our customers have been suffering from the lack of CapEx spending by the operators, but there are signs that the operators are beginning to spend money, particularly in America and in Asia in the build-out of 3G networks. So I think there may be a little upside in the wireless space in the fourth quarter. And we're starting to see the deployment as well of the TD-LTE systems in China. So expect sometime in the second half of next year we'll see the lift from that. And we're also expecting the fast pace of the build-out of wireless networks in China in the traditional TD-SCDMA sector. So I think what -- we're in about 4Q, I think looking into the next fiscal year, I think we'll see some good upside, particularly in the wireless area. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Does that imply that the wired side of things is a bit of a headwind right now? Vincent T. Roche It's relatively flat. It's been flat for the last couple of quarters. And that business is comprised of enterprise networking, cable infrastructure, and it's been relatively muted over the last couple of quarters. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just a question on the consumer side of things. Could you give us a little more color on what's driving the upside beyond seasonality? And to the extent seasonality comes into that mix, how should we think about the duration of that business being up before it seasonally -- potentially rolls over? Jerald G. Fishman Well -- this is Jerry. The -- I think the way to think about it is we, a year or 2 ago, really tried to focus our consumer business on opportunities that were much more sustainable to customers who were willing to pay us a fair margin for. And we've reset that product line pretty substantially. So I think we have a good cycle coming up, we believe. And some of the newer products that we've done in the consumer space that we think really add new types of functionality to consumer products that we believe are going to be very valuable. So of course the consumer business always has its up and downs. And the fourth quarter is typically a good seasonal quarter for consumer products. First quarter tends to be somewhat weaker sometimes. But consumer products is still a relatively small part of our total sales. So I think that as we look over the next period out there, I think in the short term, our results will be much heavier, much more dependent on what happens in the macro economy to our industrial, our communications business. The consumer revenues will modulate with product cycles and buildups for seasonal purchases but I think in the next 3 to 6 months, it's going to be mostly about the macro stuff for us when you factor everything into it. And that is going to be much more relevant to our sales than any of these cycles. I think in the fourth quarter, we are going to get some lift from a couple of product launches in consumer but after that, I think it's going to be mostly dependent on the macro stuff. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Great. And one follow-up, I guess more for Dave on this one. You mentioned about holding OpEx pretty much flat until macro shows some better positive signs of life. As we look into early fiscal '13, in the January quarter, are there any sequential changes that we should be prepared for; FICO taxes, bonus merit, things like that, that pop that up even by a couple million dollars? David A. Zinsner No, not really. I mean we'll likely have some inflationary effect sometime next year but it's relatively modest, it adds 1% or 2% to the OpEx per year. Jerald G. Fishman I mean our take is for the levels that the business is operating at now and what we see in the near future, we got plenty of OpEx to grow in this business. And for us, it's mostly a question of focusing that OpEx on the right stuff. And so I think that's what Dave's comment is really based on. We got plenty of money we're spending, investing in the business. The real question is just make sure we put it in the right places. That's what we're working on. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division This is Parag for Uche. Just wanted to drill down further on your consumer business. Are you expecting any ramp in your MEMS microphone business? And is that what is driving the upside in the fourth quarter? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we have a good MEMS microphone. We expect the revenues in that to continue to grow. Vincent T. Roche Our consumer business again has 3 million components to it. And so we will see a lift in all 3 sectors, basically in the digital imaging, the portable space and home entertainment during the fourth quarter. So the consumer area is one of the spaces that uses every piece of technology and every type of product that we got, so it's actually quite diverse. And we'll see a general lift, I believe, in the fourth quarter, not dependent on any one product or area. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay, fair enough. And coming to the industrial business, you indicated that, that business is going to be flat. Just wanted to get a feel of whether this is a temporary pause or you think -- what is the level of visibility into this end market beyond the current quarter? Vincent T. Roche I think if you look at our business over the last couple of quarters in the industrial sector, we had a very sharp rebound of about 12% in the second quarter. We held onto that in the third quarter. From talking to customers all over the world I think, for the industrial sector, there's a lot of optimism about next year. But I think in the very, very short term, our customers are being very careful in terms of placing backlogs, building inventory. So I think there's a very good match currently between the consumption rates and the demand rates in ADI. And I don't see that change much, certainly during the next 3 or 4 months. Operator Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I guess if I could follow up a little bit on those last comments on the industrial segment, I believe you said the distribution channel actually increased orders in the month of July. So if I heard that right, did that continue into August? And is that at all unusual given the relatively tepid environment? Should we read anything into that, or is that just more a function of kind of lean supply chain at this point? Jerald G. Fishman Jim, I wouldn't read anything into that. The weekly distribution orders on us, patterns are fairly erratic. And they go up and down week to week. I think it was -- to us, it was more an indication rather than it's a long-term trend going on there that at least stop being eternal pessimist on this stuff. That at least they don't see their business eroding or they wouldn't be placing those kind of orders on us rather than us standing up and say that's the beginning of a trend. Vincent T. Roche I think you've got to look at the end customer bookings patterns. I think if you look over the last 6 months, that's bookings in the OEM and disti sectors at the end-customer level, what you'll see is a tremendous consistency over that 12 months in every region and across the industrial sector. So I think there's just, as Jerry said early on, there's no events in one way or the other. It's just didn't -- very, very stable. Jerald G. Fishman I mean the real challenge for us has been in trying to plan and manage Analog. The industrial business, which is a large part of our business, you read all the stories how the world is going to come apart and you get worried about that. So the very positive thing that we took out of really pouring through all the customers and all the geographies, as Vince was saying, is that it's very stable. And I think in this world right now, stability is a good thing. And we didn't see anything in the numbers either through the end of last quarter or the first couple of weeks of this quarter that indicate anything other than stability. And like I said in this world right now, stability is a good thing, right? I would reiterate I'd be cautious about trying to say, interpret that comment about July, the increased orders is the beginning of a trend. I hope it is, but I'm not jumping on that one yet. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And if I could ask my follow-up, Dave, just relative to the gross margins, if you get gross margins back to sort of the more peak levels, is that -- how much of that is going to be mix-dependent versus utilization-dependent? Is one or the other of those more critical to getting the margins back to the peak level? David A. Zinsner Both would be helpful. Clearly utilization would be a bigger component of the, I think, driver of the gross margin. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And is there an aggregate, a certain number of increase in basis points in utilization that's going to drive a certain number of gross margin improvement? David A. Zinsner I wouldn't say we have any kind of specific targets. But like I said, utilization was up a little bit north of 80% when our gross margins were kind of running in the 67%. I mean so that's probably a reasonable rule of thumb. Jerald G. Fishman And probably if it goes up, the mix will be relatively consistent. So that's probably -- so you can write, do an algorithm for that. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, you had mentioned that distributors are signaling a wide range of possible outcomes here at the end of the year. And I'm wondering is that from a particular geography? Or does that relate to a particular set of end markets? Can you give us some more color there? Jerald G. Fishman Our distributors came to focus more on the industrial market. And our overall distribution business is very U.S. and Europe-centric, and the main stream of distribution. So I think it's related to that. And there's 2 big distributors that we use. And I think if you just briefly read the commentary there, saying, \"You know things look okay, things look stable.\" But at the margin, they're packing a little more a parachute on the range of possibilities for next quarter, which is not surprising given all the uncertainty out there. But certainly, it's hard for us to get -- be more certain of the guidance when they're not very certain of their guidance. And they're not an insignificant portion of our business. But again, I think you can look at it 2 different ways. One sense, you say that sounds very uncertain. On the other hand, even the range of guidance they put out indicates that they think business is stable. So we tend to focus on that commentary as much as the precise numbers they are putting out. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay, that's helpful. And then switching gears to the automotive end market. It looks like we're taking a breather here after what was a really strong trailing 4 quarters. How should we think about automotives potential to reaccelerate over the next couple quarters? And how big can automotive become as a percent of mix in the next couple of years? Vincent T. Roche Yes. Well automotive is currently about 17% of the company's revenue. It's grown at double digits for multiple years here, and then we'll do it -- that again this year. What we've seen in the last couple of quarters, I think, is really related to the European market and European car manufacturers. So we've seen the manufacturing output reduced in Europe due to the economic uncertainty. And I think as well the lackluster performance we've seen in Europe has been offset to some extent by strength in other areas, such as Asia where we're beginning to see some good momentum build for the company finally, so in Japan, as well as the China and Korea. So I think our momentum bodes very, very well. And that's coupled with the recovery that is likely to happen in Europe. I think -- I hope that even next year, we should do quite well. Also, the new product pipeline and the design pipeline that we have would lead us to believe that the kind of growth we've been seeing in the 12%-plus area per year, we can keep that momentum going. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division And what is the geographic mix of the automotive business across Asia, U.S. and Europe? Vincent T. Roche Off the top of my head, it's probably -- U.S. and Europe combined are probably 70%, 75%, and the rest is Asia. Jerald G. Fishman I mean I think the trend that we can rely on is what Vince was saying is that direct product content growth is going up. There's an awful lot of analog and mixed signal content and all the sensors, all the engine controls, all the battery, monitoring, all the communications links, all the safety features, cars are going to have rollover control pretty soon legislated that consumes a lot of gyros. So I think that there's a lot of macro trends in the automotive market that really will help us accelerate our sales. That will be to some degree at least to our close approximation, much more relevant than how many more cars get sold this year or next, which doesn't change all that much. So I think the macro trends in the automotive market and the positions that we're continuing to build with the largest suppliers to the automotive market here in Europe, in Japan recently and in Korea recently are such that I think we'll do very well, if those trends continue. Operator Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee &amp; Leach. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division A couple of questions. One if you look at the distributor side, what are the inventory levels on the distributor side? And the industrial, when you look at the different segments within industrial, where do you see strength and where do you see kind of weakness or kind of limited visibility in those -- in that market? David A. Zinsner So I'll answer the first. I think Vince will answer the second. Inventory was on an absolute dollar basis slightly down and on days of inventory -- weeks of inventory is what we typically measure that, it was about 7.5 weeks, which is consistent with what it was last quarter. Vincent T. Roche Okay. And on the industrial sector, the area where we saw most weakness was the energy sector, both metrology as well as the transmission distribution part of that. We expected some rebound in the -- at the industrial automation area, it didn't happen. So most of the other subset of industrial were relatively flat for the quarter, 1 or 2 a little up, but energy down. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division Got it. And just making out a little bit to the last question there. When you look at the January quarter, any thoughts on what seasonality typically is? And are you seeing anything out of the ordinary in terms of trends as you look out? Jerald G. Fishman I mean not at this point in time. I mean we're trying to get through the fourth quarter right now, and then we'll give you an update on what we think about the fourth -- the first quarter when we get through this quarter. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division First one is on OpEx growth, and I'm trying to think how to conceptually model it going forward. So let's assume your sales growth 10% next year. With that kind of sales growth, how should we think about OpEx growth? David A. Zinsner Well, I mean we don't have an exact target. I would tell you that in the near term, given a lot of the uncertainty that exists, we're trying to keep it relatively flat with where we're spending today. If the business begins to recover, we'll look -- likely grow expenses, but we're trying to keep it at a rate that's significantly below whatever the revenue growth rate is. So our goal is -- from the 32% operating margins that we operate today on a non-GAAP basis, our goal, if we start to see some recovery, is to see the operating margins begin to expand. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Got it. And next one on the wireless infrastructure business, I believe you mentioned good growth opportunities there. How much does 4G or LTE contribute to that? And how much content expansion can you have as the mix shifts more towards LTE deployments? Vincent T. Roche The lion's share of our business today is 3G. At the present time, 4G is just rolling out. It's less -- it's quite a bit less than 10% of our wireless revenue, but it will become a very significant contributor over the next couple of years. So I think what you'll see is our business today is composed of 2G, 3G and now 4G. But I think in the next couple of years, you'll see a predominance of 3G. I think we'll still be 3G dominated for the next 2, 3 years. But LTE will become a significant part. I can only expect that it could be 20%, 30% of our revenue in that area in the next 2, 3 years. Jerald G. Fishman Certainly that's the fastest-growing parts of our wireless business right now, so it all depends on just how that grows relative to the more traditional 3G stuff. Vincent T. Roche The good news is we have a lot of content with more content specifically in a 4G system than we have in a 3G system, and all of these regular subsets are become enormously complex. And of course there's a lot of -- each one's got to handle the legacies as well. So the complexity of the silicon we're delivering increases generation by generation, and that will handle more frequencies, more bandwidth, more economic range. So the bottom value is increasing as well persistent. So as these 4G systems build out, we're very optimistic about our revenue growth potential there. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Is there any way to size that expansion? Is it 10% more, 15% more, 20% more as you grow from 3G to 4G? Vincent T. Roche More than 20%. Operator Our next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie Research. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research A lot of my questions have been answered already. But I was wondering if I could ask some more on the content growth story. You've highlighted the wireless segment and you've tried to quantify that. I was wondering if you could quantify some of the other areas that are non-automotive related in terms of content growth and maybe specifically, call out like industrial control systems or military equipment or other areas where you're also seeing a generation-to-generation content growth story. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Energy has been a good growth story for the company in the industrial sector over the past 5 years. And it's not a very big part of ADI's business. But the growth has been good, and it's a great long-term bet for the company. We see parts of the industrial automation sector, particularly in Asia we've done a good job, I think, connecting with our customers and the key applications there in the Asia region, so that would be a very good contributor for the company. In the wired infrastructure area, we've been investing heavily in building a portfolio in the observation control area, in areas like timing clock controls, timing generation clock controls. And these controllers, we have a dominant position in the controller circuits that monitor optical systems and cable infrastructure systems. So they are just a couple of spaces. Automotive of course, we've good position in powertrain, in infotainment, as well as safety. And all of those sectors are growing at a fast clip for the company. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Now is this -- I'm sorry to interrupt. I was going to ask is this a case of the complexity of your devices is growing as is your price in the system? Or is this your shipping more units into a box and displacing other kinds of devices? Or what's the dynamic happening within the box itself? Vincent T. Roche There's a little bit new -- I mean there's a lot of new features we have. As you know car companies are largely selling their cars in the basis of electronics technologies today. So there's a lot of new features that we're being asked to address. So again, I think the way to look at it is the complexity of the circuits and the products that we're shipping generation to generation is increasing and allowing us to increase our form value generation on generation there. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up, and I'll go away. The consumer business is going to be up double digits based on the math you kind of laid out for us, which would be a seasonal increase. I'm just trying to come to grips on what seasonal build versus some of the new product cycles you've highlighted. Can you specifically call out how the product cycle aspect of it, the new business you're getting is affecting your outlook for Q4? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it's really both. It's very challenging to try to give you a breakout of that and say half of that or 1/3 or whatever. I think the only takeaway is we're going to get some lift in the fourth quarter. We think we have a good product cycle. It's a seasonally strong quarter for us, and we'll wait and see what happens after that. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division With regard to your exposure on the wireline, you mentioned a little content on the optical systems, just wondering if you could talk about, is that more centered around like 40 or 100G? Or is that more like passive optical network-type systems? And to the extent that you're in the PON systems, is that you're seeing any pickup in the China build-outs? Vincent T. Roche Most of our business in the wired infrastructure area is not particularly in the data path, were -- it's mainly observation control, timing -- timing generation control, some data path solutions. I think it's true to say that in the optical subsystem area, we've seen -- I think over last 4 quarters, we've seen just a stable -- no growth, stable pattern, same thing as in the cable infrastructure market. And I think we certainly are playing in the China area. We've seen a little growth in China. I think which is then offset by some decline in America, largely due to ASP side. Jerald G. Fishman I think if you look at longer term in the wireline communications market, I think the real opportunity for ADI is going to wind up being integration of a lot of stuff we do. And we have a lot of the -- as Vince was saying, a lot of the stuff we do now is pinpoint products that are relatively standard products for that market. But I think increasingly as we get a much better insight into what our customers really need and want, there's an opportunity to take multiple technologies and integrate them for many of those customers. So I think that's where the breakout opportunity in that business for us exists. If it's just selling basically catalog products to customers that might be picked out for a particular usage, I think it's -- there is an opportunity. It's not huge growth opportunity. I think if we could accomplish some of the things that we're setting out to do now in terms of the level of integration that we could accomplish for those kind of customers, I think that's where we get an inflection point to the growth rate in that market. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Great. And just for my follow-up, you talked a number of times here about the new products in the consumer market. Can you give us a little more detail about what's changed or what specifically you've done that's new, what innovations you have made that's allowing you to get this big bump? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think we have a lot of different applications in the consumer market. We saw products that are in the audio signal chain, which are real important to a lot of customers, given that audio is a more important application than it's ever been in a lot of consumer products. We do a lot of video in the consumer area. We have products that range from relatively simple pinpoint products to highly integrated products that go into these applications. We sell MEMS products into consumer applications. So it's really a mixture of a lot of different things that go into our consumer business. The real challenge in the consumer business for all of us, I think, is developing or having products and customer relationships that last a long time from generation to generation and that turn out to differentiate our customers' products so that we can earn a fair return on them. And that's where we're focusing our effort. We're seeing some benefit of that focus coming up. Vincent T. Roche Given the life cycles of most of the systems onto which we ship in the consumer segment, virtually everything we do is a new product. Jerald G. Fishman That's both a good news and a bad news, right? Operator Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens Inc. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Jerry, I think you talked about the areas in industrial that are not doing better. But I was wondering... David A. Zinsner That was Vince actually. Vince is the one with the Irish accent, not Jerry. If you can't tell that one, then we got to get you a phone line. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division I was wondering if you guys could talk about areas in industrial that are actually doing well rather than to the normal industrial business. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Energy was doing very, very well, I'd say, at this point in time. We run R&amp;D investment over the last 3 years in industrial to get a much, much sharper, more intense focus in areas like factory automation and process control. And they've actually done well for this company over the last couple of years. The last 3 quarters have been -- the last 4 quarters have been tough. But as I said earlier, energy has been a good growth story, double-digit growth for the company for the past 4 or 5 years. And it's our expectation that we'd be able to get the industrial automation sector into kind of the 8% to 10% compounded growth over the coming years. Jerald G. Fishman To me, one of the encouraging parts of the industrial market right now is that when Vince goes out and visits these customers and occasionally convinces me to go with him, what you hear from those customers is that theyre always dragging us into some of these applications that we've never been in before because they understand that they're very challenging and they have a lot of respect for some of the core technologies that Analog has that they think is very applicable in some of these segments. So some of them are just -- we make the highest speed and most accurate converters and amplifiers as we always have and some of them are actually asking us to do a lot more integration for them than we've ever done in the past, either for reasons of speed, performance or cost or size. So I think increasingly is that the industrial business, which if you go back 5 years used to be, we have a lot of customers and we sell a lot of products to, I think increasingly there's an opportunity for us to really do a much more systems-oriented approach to some of these consumer -- some of these industrial applications. And certainly, we have one of the best capabilities in the world given our core technology to do those kinds of things for those customers. And when they look around and they look at the whole universe of companies that really have that level of technology and commitment to the industrial business, despite all the press releases and rhetoric out there, it's a very short list of companies that could actually do that for them. And we're certainly high on their list, I think, to do that. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Got it, that's very helpful. And again a question for either Jerry or Vince. I'm curious if there is anything like any kind of normal seasonality left in the industrial business at this point in time. Any quarters that are stronger than others that you've noticed in the past 2 or 3 years? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I would say that our second fiscal quarter is historically -- if you go back many years in the absence of any macroeconomic headwinds or tailwinds, our second quarter is typically our strongest industrial quarter because it has the most days in it basically. And when a lot of the systems comes to distribution, a lot of it is how many days of sales we get. But I would say right now the dominant factor remains the macro stuff. And I continue to believe that seasonality right now is a trap for everybody because other effects dominated much more so than seasonality. Operator Your next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division If you could, Jerry, you've been through a lot of cycles and if we look at this cycle, you've mentioned that clearly macro is weighing on it. Are there any things outside of macro that you think we should be looking towards to see when we're going to start to resume what we call sort of normal semiconductor growth patterns? And I'm referring maybe to the aging chart that you guys typically have shown investors that show the adoption of newer products in the market and details on your older products. Are you seeing any changes to those product uptakes? Jerald G. Fishman No. I mean I don't really think so, Doug. We've looked at that business chart every quarter quite methodically. And it turns out that all the reasons why that chart has been the way it is for the better part of 25 years, or longer actually, I think is still in place today. In industrial products, the average usage for application is relatively low. The performance criteria are very high and customers don't like to change. Even though they develop new products, they tend to bring along the level of technology that they're familiar with. So I think all those factors are still a very dominant factor in the industrial business. I think the only change, if there is one, is one of the comments I made just a little earlier in reference to the industrial market is I think there is an increasing opportunity to provide more systems level capability in the industrial market that is more tailored products to particular segments in the industrial market. And I think that's another just growth opportunity for Analog that I think didn't exist 5 or 10 years ago. So that's a very slow building phenomena. I still say the industrial market is very similar to the way it was 5 or 10 years ago. And I think if we continue to really win at the core technology level in amplifiers and converters and some of the other product areas that we're in, I think we'll continue to do extremely well in the industrial market, which values those characteristics probably more so than a lot of other markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division That's a good segue into sort of my next question. Over the last 5 or 6 years, you've done quite a nice job of sort of pruning and focusing your product segments that you're attacking. We saw you move a little bit out of DSP. It's sort of interesting, DSP is still holding on to a decent percentage of revenue there. It's a little better than I might have expected. Jerald G. Fishman That was always the goal. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division And how do you feel about the positioning of the company now to service the new growth opportunities? Are there pieces missing? And are you -- do you need to focus some more effort again back into power management to deliver some of those solutions? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think there's always pieces missing in the puzzle. And we have a lot of opportunities to fill some of those pieces, either with acquisition or investment. I think in the power management part of the business, we've -- I think as we've mentioned previously, we've changed our strategy quite a bit over the last couple of years to really attach power management where we already control a large part of the bill of material than trying to compete in the broad based power business, which increasingly is getting overcrowded, and there's too many competitors in there right now. So I think our power management business now, we have some very talented people, but they are very focused on where we are in control of the signal processing bill of materials to add power capability. And we're getting very good take for that from our customers. I think in other areas, we've just made an acquisition in the very high performance clock area, which is an area that we're very familiar with. Every -- a large part of our converters are clocked by something. And we think there is some new technologies out there that can fundamentally change the game in clocking. And that's obviously a natural thing to sell alongside of our converters. We've made other acquisitions that we think will change some of the dynamics in the -- what you can deliver for what power dissipation and signal processing. So I think the areas that we'll continue to pick away at where we see either new technology emerging or holds or what we're trying to do for our customers. And I think we've done that in the past couple of years, and I think we'll continue to do that in the future. Operator Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Maybe a question for Dave, since Jerry and Vince are stealing all the airtime here. Dave, inventory were 120 in the quarter. You mentioned it would be down, but it's higher than a lot of your peers which are running below 100 days. And I guess my question is what is it about your mix that requires 4 months of inventory on hand? The implication would be that gross margins are inflated. David A. Zinsner Well we do carry a bit more inventory. We generally carry 100 to 110 days of inventory. We do that because we have a ton of different products. And we are very much focused on our ability to deliver in kind of short lead time environments. We think that in a lot of cases, it differentiates us from some of our competitors. So that's one primary reason why we keep -- we just generally keep a higher level of inventory. And that's quarter-over-quarter, so that doesn't necessarily inflate margins. We have built up inventory here in the near term, maybe a little bit higher than we would typically coming into several product cycles within the consumer space. And we need to be ramped in order to meet that demand. So that's the other driver. Most of that production is actually done outside. So we really don't get much in the way of absorption benefit from that. So that really didn't necessarily drive the gross margin, it more was a general factory utilization increase, which didn't have a huge impact on the inventory levels in the quarter. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division So lead time then for the company, you would estimate would be lower than a lot of your peers, and that ultimately translates into better revenue growth? Is that the way to think about it? David A. Zinsner Well it depends on the environment. Right now we're probably all in similar lead time environments. So when cycles turn up, we tend to be able to maintain our lead times within a 4- to 6-week period. We see a fair amount of our competitors see those stretched out. I think the last big cycle we had, some of them stretched out about 20 weeks. So we don't like that. We don't think that's good for our customers. So we try to control that as best as we can through just careful inventory management. Jerald G. Fishman The other part that Dave didn't mention is that the inventory doesn't go bad on us. We build inventory and very long life cycle products. I don't remember the last time we wrote off inventory in Analog of any consequence. So I think the trade-off that we make is we want to be able to keep our lead times short, it makes our order patterns more predictable. It makes the factories run smoother. It helps our gross margins from the standpoint of keeping the loading levels where -- that are stable. And we think ultimately that really helps us competitively. Operator Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division So you mentioned earlier that the key candidate to gross margin was going to be utilization rates rather than mix. Did you say what your gross margin will be if your utilization rates were to go back to the 80% level? And then if we need some additional mix improvement as well for you guys to get closer to 70% gross margin level, where would that mix opportunity come from? David A. Zinsner All we said was that our utilization when our margins were up in the 67% range, we're slightly above 80%. So I think that if our utilization was to get back over 80% given that a fair amount of that will be mix beneficial as well because industrial tends to drive utilization, we think our margins would be in that range. Outside of that, our goal is certainly to improve gross margins. We do have a number of things that we're working on to improve it. But we don't have any set target on gross margins per se. Really the function of why our margins are where they are is the function of our strategy of highly differentiated products in markets that we think value that -- those differentiated and high-performance products. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just a couple of quickies. Vince, can you give us a rundown of the linearity of bookings during the previous quarter and why you guys feel confident in guiding for normal seasonal growth this quarter? Did things just kind of erode during the first couple of months and then stabilize in July and getting better in August? Or was it a step function down in stability after that? Maybe just a little color there. Vincent T. Roche Chris, it was remarkably consistent over the past 2 quarters month by month in every region, across the 2 major channels. There was no -- I mean there were no anomalies, and it's remarkable in its steadiness. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division And so given the fact that you came at the low end of the range last quarter, why guide for normal seasonal growth this quarter? Vincent T. Roche Sorry, say that again? Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Given that you guys came in towards the low end of the range of guidance for revenue last quarter and I believe you're going for a close to normal seasonal growth this quarter, was there something that gave you some more confidence that things wouldn't erode like they did last quarter? Vincent T. Roche Certainly on the consumer side of things, we're expecting a lift this quarter. We're confident about that. And that would be the primary chunk of any increase we got this quarter in revenues. Jerald G. Fishman Well we have -- the most important thing is you have a larger opening backlog that we already booked, which we think is secure, and although you'll never know. And the projections that we're making about next quarter are based on that backlog. We're in a very high churn environment, so you never quite know what's going to happen in detail in distribution. But as Vince said, the trends are pretty stable and all that's a good thing. So I mean but there is -- the reason there's a range there is because nobody really knows. And we feel we have a pretty good -- if we knew we say what we know, but we're just telling you what the range of possibilities as we see it right now is it's based on a bunch of assumptions about most of the other businesses being about flat, which could change one way or the other. It's based on the backlog we have at consumer, which we think is good, but could change also. So I don't think we can get away from the fact that there's a lot of uncertainty in trying to predict revenues that our size -- plus or minus $10 million in the quarter is very, very challenging. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division That makes total sense. And then you guys said that the inventories were about 7.5 weeks essentially flat sequentially. Have you seen any change up or down from what you can tell in OEM inventory? David A. Zinsner Well the best way we can track it is just looking at their aggregate inventory. We don't have a visibility obviously into how much of our products is being held on their balance sheet. But their inventory levels just -- what we tend to do is take the top customers and track their days of inventory. And it was generally consistent with the prior quarter. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citigroup. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Two quick ones. The first one is you're expecting consumer to drive the entirety of growth in the October quarter. Is there any reason to not think that January revenues would be down sequentially then? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it all depends on what happens in the macro sense. If the macro stuff we -- the consumer stuff, it really depends on what happens with the product cycles in consumer and the macro economy. So one could say that might happen, but I can't say with any confidence that, that will happen. We'll have to just wait and see. But clearly, typically in normal times without any specific product momentum, you'd see the first quarter consumer being lower than the fourth quarter. On the other hand, some of those other businesses could go up in Q1. So we just don't know yet. And we're not prepared to sort of get ahead of this thing and go up with a forecast for Q1 while we're in the third week of Q4. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Fair enough. The follow-up question I had was regarding your process technology announcement with TSMC in a co-development of 0.18 process. Can you explain the rationale in making available jointly developed process to competitors potentially? Is the motivation of that to garner any sort of a royalty stream? Jerald G. Fishman Could you repeat the first part of that question? I didn't quite get it. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Sure. You had a press release this quarter about a co-development of a 0.18 process with TSMC that is being made available, I believe, to some of your competitors. I want to understand the motivation for that process development in making that available to competitors... Jerald G. Fishman Sure, I understand. Well some of the larger chips we do requires more advanced digital lithography, and so it's not a predominant part of what we do. Most of what we do with TSMC is 1 or 2 generations behind the most advanced stuff. But 0.18 is no longer the most advanced digital technology out there now. There are many companies working at 28 nanometers. So I would say it's a progression of what we've been doing with TSMC for many, many years. It's not really changed. And I think a lot of the stuff that's proprietary to Analog stays proprietary to Analog. That's the most important takeaway. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Are you garnering royalty stream for that? Is that the motivation? Jerald G. Fishman No, I do think the motivation is a royalty stream. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division This is Amit Chanda, dialing in for David Wong. Can you update us on your recent acquisition of Multigig in terms of your traction there for the high-end clock timing business? Vincent T. Roche We have -- at this point, we have fully integrated the team. We're very, very pleased with the progress that we're making in terms of incorporating the intellectual property that we acquired from Multigig. And we're actually starting to see -- the very, very first generation of product that they developed, we're starting to see some modest revenues. And we've moved them aggressively now into second-generation product design. So at this point, we're very, very pleased with what we see and what we're getting. Amit Chanda - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Okay, great. And then as a follow-up, Dave, in the context of today's macroeconomic environment, can you maybe talk about your expectations for ADI's R&amp;D budget in FY '12? And I guess should we be modeling R&amp;D at 17% of sales over the long run? David A. Zinsner Well I think what I said before, it's pretty accurate when we focus in on one of the line items within operating expenses, which is we're looking to kind of contain OpEx in the near term given the uncertainty in the macro environment. If things improve and revenue starts to grow, we're likely to grow both on the R&amp;D and SG&amp;A line to some level, but at a level that trails the revenue growth. Ultimately, we probably will want to run somewhere in that 17% of sales for R&amp;D. Ali Husain Folks, we have a number of people still waiting to ask questions. If we're not able to get your question in the allotted time you can reach me, Ali Husain, after the call at  461-3282. And before we take the last few questions, I would like to mention that our fourth quarter 2012 earnings release is scheduled for November 27, 2012, after which we'll host and our conference call will begin approximately 5 p.m. Eastern Time that same date. Now we're ready to take the additional questions. Operator Your question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division I wonder if you could update us just on your latest thoughts on the cash balance. I know you've been returning a lot of it to shareholders, but I know you've also been looking at options to return more. Can you just give us your latest thoughts there? David A. Zinsner Well I'll comment. I'm sure Jerry will have a comment as well. I think we've been focused in both ways in returning cash to shareholders, both through share repurchases and dividends. We just increased the dividend 20% a couple of quarters ago to ramp up that part of the equation. We have been buying back stock from quarter to quarter. It tends to be a little bit volatile depending on what the stock price is and how we're feeling about the world. We do have plenty of cash on the balance sheet in the U.S., which is where we would normally get the cash for repurchases. We have $1 billion. We also have capacity on the debt side, if we want to take advantage of that. We have a $585 million authorization to repurchase stock. So I think you'll see us be active repurchases of stock over time. It might change from quarter to quarter depending on the environment but over time, we will certainly be buyers of the stock. We'll also be very committed on the dividend side, I think, as well. We ramped up the payout ratio. I think we paid out plus 50% this quarter in terms of dividend, and I think you'll see us be fairly committed to the dividend. We talked to a number of our largest shareholders over -- clearly over the course of years, but certainly within the last few quarters and really felt like a significant portion of them seems to favor an increase in the dividend, and we responded to that by increasing this a couple of quarters ago. So that's really the goal. Clearly we are still focused on periodic small tuck-in technology acquisitions as well. And so certainly some portion of the cash will be used for that purpose as well. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division Guys, I just -- I'm curious about the utilization dropping in the October quarter. Just given your comments about stability in the business, at the midpoint, your sequential growth for the current quarter is actually going to be higher than the prior quarter, and you talked about inventories being in decent shape. So how do I read the drop of utilization? I apologize if it's nitpicking. I know it's only going to be down a little bit, but I was just kind of curious if you can give any color on that. Jerald G. Fishman Well I think the increase we're going to get on the sales line at least in the forecast right now is primarily consumer stuff. We primarily fabricate that not in our own facilities. So we looked at it and we say, we'd like to keep the inventory down more towards the 100 to 110 day area, as Dave said. And that -- and the reason we like to do that more than anything else is it gives us a lot more leverage on the upside when business gets better as compared to selling old inventory when business gets better. So we've -- in the old days, we would have just kept building it or leave it at the air. But I think now, we sense keeping it down to those levels is the best long-term decision for us. So that's what we're doing. I mean it doesn't really indicate either our enthusiasm or pessimism about the future. It's much more a question of that we have 121 days, we want to get it down to about 110 days, and most of the growth in Q4 is going to come out of stuff that we don't fabricate ourselves. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division And then guys just as a follow-on there. The cycle time through a fab is about how long? Jerald G. Fishman We have 350 processes we run in on those fabs, each has a different cycle time. But I think they range anywhere from probably 8 to 15 weeks depending on the complexity of the process. Ali Husain And that concludes our Q&amp;A session. We appreciate your participation. We look forward to talking to all of you again during our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call scheduled for November 27, 2012 beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time. Thanks very much.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Okay, Ali. You can take a deep breath. Ali Husain I just want you to have more time is all, Jerry. Jerald G. Fishman Okay, good. Glad to hear. Well, hi and good afternoon to everybody who's joining the call. As you know from the press release, our revenues for Q1 were about $622 million, which was down about 10% from the previous quarter and also down about 4% from the same period last year, which you might remember, the first quarter last year was a 14-week quarter. The diluted earnings per share, which exclude a few special items, was $0.44, which was at approximately the midpoint of our guidance that we provided last quarter. Overall, the order and sales patterns were very challenging during the first 2 months of our Q1, as our customers continued to reduce their inventories and industrial and infrastructure capital spending remained very muted going into the end of the calendar year. In January, order rates began to improve and remained strong so far this quarter. Our belief is that the current order strength is the result of our customers becoming more confident about their prospects as 2013 unfolds and also the end of inventory de-stocking. This has certainly been a pretty tough cycle, particularly in the industrial market where we believe that customers ordering has been well below consumption now for several quarters. Based on historically low customer inventory levels and feedback we get from our largest customers and also our largest distributors, we expect that Q1 will likely be the trough quarter for ADI in this cycle. Over the past few quarters when demand weakened, we very carefully managed our business, keeping production levels low and our inventory under very tight control. Inventory dollars actually went down in Q1, although days increased as a result of the sales decline. We also managed operating costs very tightly, and we moved strategic resources to the most important programs. And finally, by design, our variable compensation costs were lower as business conditions weakened. So this all, in combination, produced very respectable margins and very strong cash flow during a very challenging quarter and has also set up significant upside operating leverage as business conditions improve. Our very strong cash flow and balance sheet support an increase to our dividend, and this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.34, which is up 13% from last quarter. This increase reflects our strategy to continuously enhance our shareholders' returns via increasing dividends and is enabled by ADI's very strong and consistent cash generation capability. Since the first dividend was paid in December of 2003 almost 10 years ago, we have paid the cash dividend to shareholders each and every quarter, and we've grown the dividend consistently over that period. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Vince for some more details and insights into the trends in the end markets, and I'll come back after Vince and Dave finish their comments to make some comments about what we see going forward. So Vince? Vincent T. Roche Well, thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everybody. Well, as we expected coming into the quarter, sales were mostly down sequentially across all our major end markets. So I'll talk about some of the specifics and provide some insight into what we see going on in each of the major markets. Firstly, industrial sector revenues, which make up about half of our total, declined 8% sequentially in Q1. The decline was broad-based across customer tiers, geographies and channels and across automation, energy, instrumentation and defense aerospace applications. As has been the case now for several quarters, order rates from industrial customers appear to be well below consumption rates. Customer inventory reductions, coupled with constrained CapEx, dampened order rates from these customers for much of Q1. But since early January, order rates have been improving, which leads us to expect the industrial end market will be the strongest grower in the second quarter. Now we've spoken many times about the importance of the industrial segment to ADI, and we continue to see an excellent match for the full suite of ADI's high-performance signal processing technologies. There are many macro level opportunities in such areas as power grid management, machine automation and precision instrumentation, which drive the deployment of more and more sensor and actuator systems, which in turn will drive the need for high-performance signal processing. We've been steering increasing levels of R&amp;D to the segment over the past few years to strengthen our core capabilities in converters, linear and DSPs, and to extend our capabilities in areas such as RF and MEMS in order to capture the opportunity available to us. This strengthening technology platform, along with ADI's strong reputation for technology, supply chain and quality amongst the tens of thousands of customers we serve, leads us to believe that our industrial growth can be pushed well above the average in the future. So let me turn to the communications infrastructure segment. Now in this area, sales declined 12% in the first quarter after 3 successive quarters sequential revenue increases. The decline was broad-based, with the largest sequential decrease coming from the wireless infrastructure subsegment. The CapEx environment worldwide was muted, and customers rebalanced their inventories in Q1 as they headed into the calendar year-end. Our expectation is for modest growth from the infrastructure sector in 2Q, with meaningful tailwinds to the business as we progress into the second half of the calendar year. Now accelerating the deployment of 4G LTE and TD-LTE wireless systems globally and the introduction of heterogeneous networks combining macro and small cells offer solid growth opportunities for ADI. Our customers are dealing with significant challenges in the areas of efficient and flexible spectrum utilization, power reduction, system cost and deployment efficiency. Because the radio architecture sets the performance envelope for the system, customers need the advanced radio transceiver technologies in which ADI specializes. In the past 3 years, we've increased R&amp;D to broaden our core technology reach in order to exceed our customers' needs and position ADI to deliver the most competitive radio transceiver solutions on the market. Now in addition, we've sharpened our focus in the wireline sector to focus on control applications and selective data path with advanced converter, linear and timing power solutions for the leaders in cable, Ethernet and optical infrastructure. We remain very bullish about ADI's growth prospects in the infrastructure segment, given the growth in equipment installation footprint, the fact that we continue to deepen our engagements with the market leaders and the increasing content available to ADI as we extend our available market from generation to generation. Let me focus on automotive now for just a few minutes. Revenue there declined marginally in the first quarter, down 3% sequentially, representing 17% of sales compared to 16% in the prior quarter. During the first 2 months of the quarter, we experienced inventory reductions at our customers. In January and into February, we have seen indications of an improved demand environment. So in the second quarter, we should see modest growth in automotive. Over the last few years, automotive has been a consistently strong growth sector for ADI, almost doubling in revenue from 2007 levels. With the push-pull effect of government mandates and an insatiable appetite from OEMs for high-performance signal processing, our long-term expectations remain high in automotive. Car manufacturers continue to electrify and automate the automobile. Predictive, preventive and protective safety systems, precise powertrain control systems and high-quality multimedia systems require proliferation of sensors and actuators, which in turn place ever-increasing demands in signal processing technology. So we believe this is an excellent match for ADI signal processing. Also, while we continue to have a strong presence in the U.S. and European manufacturers, we've made significant progress in executing our plan to penetrate the Asian market over the past few years. The combination of a growing served available market, strong technology match and deepening customer engagement leads us to believe that the automotive end market will continue to be a strong growth story for ADI. And finally, the consumer business declined 22% sequentially in what was an expected seasonal decline for that business in Q1 after a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. In total, consumer was 17% of sales, which is a more typical consumer mix for ADI compared to 20% in the prior quarter. We expect this segment will be approximately flat in the second quarter. Now as we've mentioned before, we have been refocusing R&amp;D on those parts of the consumer market where we can make a demonstrable and sustainable difference to the user experience, particularly in audio and imaging applications. In order to mitigate the inherent sector volatility, we endeavor to invest in a given application only when we are convinced that we can play over several generations in a leadership position and make adequate returns. Many such subsectors exist in the consumer market, and we will carefully exploit these opportunities with the market leaders in the years ahead. So at this point, I'll hand over to Dave, who will take us through the details of the financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jerry had mentioned earlier, first quarter revenue declined 10% sequentially to $622 million. Revenues declined 4% compared to the first quarter of 2012, which, as Jerry mentioned, was a 14-week quarter. Our gross margin was 62.7% in the first quarter. This was down from 63.8% that we reported in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower factory utilization. Utilization decreased from the high 60s in the prior quarter to the mid 50s in the first quarter, which dropped inventory on our balance sheet by $6.5 million. Inventory and distribution was down in dollars in the first quarter but in terms of days was up about 1 week to 8 weeks based on lower sales. We believe inventory in this channel is increasing, in line with improved end customer order rates through the distributors. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. We recorded a $40 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, and if you'd like further details, you can find more information in the Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were $222.7 million, which was down $5 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to tight control over discretionary items and also due to our variable compensation model, which modulates with business performance. Operating profits before tax for the first quarter, excluding this restructuring charge, was $168 million or 26.9% of sales, down approximately 400 basis points from the prior quarter. Other expense of $3 million in the first quarter was flat to the fourth quarter and reflect the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 17%, excluding an adjustment of our annual tax rate for the reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit. We're expecting our tax rate to be approximately 17% for the remainder of FY '13. Diluted earnings per share of $0.44, excluding special items, was at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow in the first quarter continued to be strong. We generated 25% of our revenue or $158 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $18 million, resulting in free cash flow of $140 million or 22.5% of revenue for the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments balance increased about $87 million during the first quarter and now stands at approximately $4 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion available domestically. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $760 million in debt outstanding. Net cash on a per outstanding share basis was slightly above $10. Our accounts receivable balance was down about $10 million versus the last quarter on lower overall shipments in the quarter. And our day sales outstanding increased to 48 days from 45 days in the prior quarter, which is typical in a recovering business environment. During the first quarter, we distributed approximately $91 million or 69% of GAAP net income in dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, up from $0.30 last quarter, which will be paid on March 12, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of about 3% and represents a 13% dividend increase. While we repurchased a relatively small amount of stock this quarter, we continue to view repurchases as an important vehicle to improve shareholder return, and we'll continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock, with about $560 million remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program. Our results in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of results to invest for the future while responsibly dealing with the realities of an uncertain market. Our actions during this cycle have built in significant operating leverage as we continue to focus our investments on profitable, diverse and sustainable markets and begin to increase production levels as orders increase while keeping tight control of our operating expenses. We have a very responsive manufacturing organization capable of responding quickly to the changing demand patterns. So now I'll turn the call over to Jerry for some closing comments and to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Well, thanks, Dave. As I mentioned earlier, our sense is that Q1 will turn out to be the trough quarter for ADI in this cycle, and we expect revenue growth in Q2. We expect our most significant revenue growth during second quarter will be from industrial customers where higher order rates, inventory stabilization and somewhat higher capital spending should drive strong sequential growth in the quarter. We expect our communications infrastructure will grow slightly, mostly as a result of inventory stabilization. But as Vince mentioned earlier, our largest communications customers are forecasting many new deployments, which should result in higher demand for ADI in the second half of the calendar year. Automotive should also grow in Q2, given our higher opening backlog and generally stronger demand patterns in many regions. We expect our automotive business to continue to outgrow the market as a result of better overall car sales and a very strong ADI product position. For our consumer business, our plan is to be flat in Q2, with the growth of this business very dependent on the product cycles of our customers. In total, we're planning for revenues to grow between 4% and 8% sequentially in Q2. For the year, we should benefit from higher industrial and communications capital spending, which drives a very large portion of our business and also some more content gains in automotive. We expect utilization will be slightly better in Q2 relative to Q1 as we continue to manage our inventories. This, coupled with a stronger product mix, leads us to estimate gross margins will increase to approximately 64% in the second quarter. We're planning for OpEx to remain approximately flat in Q2, and that, coupled with the gross margin increase, should continue to provide very strong operating leverage in Q2. And as a result, we estimate that our earnings in Q2 to be in the range of 49% to 55% a rate of growth quite a bit above what our expected sales growth is. As we look longer term, we have very high confidence in our business strategy, which combines our very high-performance signal processing component technology that we sell to tens of thousands of customers, with a very unique ability to integrate this core technology into systems-level solutions for the largest customers in our served markets. Our customer base around the world is increasingly convinced that our core technology is the best in class, and our increasing systems knowledge, as applied to more integrated products, is becoming a real differentiator in our business. While economic uncertainty certainly remains, we believe that we're making the right trade-offs between continuing to invest for the future while very carefully managing the short-term operations of the company. And if this cycle follows the patterns of previous cycles, we will emerge from this cycle stronger than when the cycle began, and we should continue to provide continuing very solid returns to our shareholders as a result. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Jerry. We plan to run this call until 6 p.m. Eastern Time. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we're now ready for questions from our participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Firstly, I wanted to dig in a little bit into the revenue guidance for next quarter. So your typical Q2 seasonality, if I look over the last 10 years or so, might be somewhere in the ballpark of, say, 1% to 4%. You're guiding up, say, 4% to 8%. Is this the snapback that everybody's been hoping for? Is this just an end to customer de-stocking that's driving that? Are customers moving into a restocking mode? Or do you see the potential for customers move back into a restocking mode? Or would you expect, I guess, a return to seasonal or even potentially sub-seasonal growth as the boost from the end of the de-stocking process tails off? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I mean, again, it's all speculation, Stacy. But our sense is that the increases we're seeing in the orders, which supports the guidance we provided, is really the combination of all those things. It's that -- I think customers are, at the margin, more enthusiastic as some of the uncertainty, particularly in the United States and Europe has been lessened, certainly. And also, as we've been saying particularly with industrial customers, there's been a huge de-stocking going on out there, which is why industrial revenues have fallen so fast. So I think there's some inventory replenishment going on, consistent with a better outlook, particularly in the industrial market, going forward. So I think like in most cycles, it's never a simple answer. It's a combination of things going on that are causing us to have a plan for Q2 in the range that Dave and I had mentioned. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Are customer inventories really that low? I mean, if we're looking at distribution, you're right back to 8 weeks, which is sort of dead in the middle of your sweet spot. [indiscernible] inventory doesn't look all that low? Jerald G. Fishman Yes. It's 8 weeks based on very low sales levels. Distributors are counting to the fact that sales are going to go up next quarter, and they are trying to get their inventory levels in line, particularly with industrial customers, of what they are expecting going forward rather than what they've seen going backward. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I just want to dig a little bit into the margins for this quarter. So you had a little bit of upside. I think you guided to 62%. You came in at 62.7%. With utilizations in the 50s and a revenue miss, I was just wondering what drove that margin upside in the quarter. David A. Zinsner The mix was a little bit better than we expected, particularly the mix within our industrial business, so that made it a little bit better. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Which end markets in industrial were driving that? David A. Zinsner It was a combination of instrumentation and automation. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Just a follow-up to Stacy's first question. Particularly in the industrial segment, has the pickup in orders gotten the orders to the consumption levels yet? Or are customers still ordering below consumption level? Jerald G. Fishman I don't really think we know with that much precision. I wish we did. But in the industrial market, we're serving tens of thousands of customers, and a lot of that is coming through distribution. So I think the only thing that we can really communicate is a sense we're getting from the largest customers, from the distributors that their outlook is a little bit better and they are starting to order some product. I think beyond that, all we can do is speculate, and I'd rather not do that. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Sure. In the comm infrastructure segment, you talked about meaningful tailwinds in the second half based on many new deployments. Geographically, can you give us a sense of how that breaks down and the timing of how that breaks down? Is that potentially China first and then maybe the U.S. later? Or how might that work? Vincent T. Roche Well, I think if you look at the public announcements in terms of capital spend, you've seen AT&amp;T, T-Mobile in the U.S. announce very aggressive build-outs during the course of year '13 here. And China Mobile and China Telecom have talked about as well releasing the, if you like, the second part of the 4G TD-SCDMA release as well in China, particularly in the second half of the year. So it seems that if you were to kind of characterize the thing, you'd say America, in particular, and then, to some extent, Japan as well. I know Japan is doing some build-outs in terms of backhaul and wireless infrastructure during the course of the year, but I think China is very much second half as we see it at this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division So my first question, I'm probably the only guy on this call that wants the upturn more than you guys. So... Jerald G. Fishman I don't think so. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division We've heard from a number of other companies that business is picking up. Jerry or Vince or Dave, can you just compare and contrast this year versus last year and why this is or is not a head fake? Is anything different between this year and last year? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's the same exact question we keep badgering our guys with, by the way. But I think last year, there were so many economic uncertainties that emerged right after the beginning of the year that were historic in nature, particularly in the U.S. and Europe but even to some degree in China. So our sense is that those -- anything could happen. The world could get very uncertain very quickly. If you want to be pessimistic, there's a lot of reasons to be so about that. But our sense is that the -- what happened last year was actually quite unique. And this year, although there's still uncertainty, it's not the catastrophic uncertainty that plagued the market when the world collapsed sort of 9 months ago. So that's our plan. That's our assumption. That's the best feedback that we get from the large customers. We're have to just wait and see what happens, but that's the best we can predict right now. And we're just trying to communicate what our plan is through the balance of the year based on the feedback we're getting from the customers. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division And as a follow-up to that, just on bookings, you commented that they continue to get better. What -- do you have any sense of what your book-to-bill is so far this quarter? Is it tracking ahead of what it was last quarter? Jerald G. Fishman We don't really look at that in that way week-to-week. I think just generally, we're seeing stronger order patterns in most regions, and they're noticeably stronger. So given the breadth of the customer base we have, we view that as a good sign right now. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Just on inventory days, I know you guys have been trying to manage it flat on a days basis, and it creeped up a little bit this last quarter. Yet at the same time, we are seeing pretty decent gross margin leverage in April. So should we expect inventory days to sort of hover around the 120-plus level? Or do you think you can bring it down here in April? David A. Zinsner Well, our goal -- if you look back last year and use that as a proxy, our utilization -- we actually increased our utilization up into the 60s last year and let the inventory go up. This time around, we're just tweaking the utilization up a little bit in an effort to get our inventories down a little bit in absolute dollars. And in addition, since revenue will be up, that should bring the days of inventory down several days, I would imagine. So our goal is to get kind of days of inventory down this quarter and kind of position us for even more significant operating -- or gross margin leverage in the back half of the year, assuming the recovery continues. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Okay. And just as a follow-up, guys, if you step back and look at historical revenues and profits, I think April of 2011 was your revenue peak, it was around $800 million and you were generating operating margins of around 38%. If we were to get back to $800 million, is that still sort of a reasonable number to assume for operating margins? Or do you think you can maybe do a little bit better than that? David A. Zinsner Yes. I mean, I think it's a first order. We're definitely committed to getting back to those same growth in operating margins at those similar revenue levels. There are things that we're doing internally to even goose that up further. But first, we'd like to just get the recovery underway. But we have been investing in the industrial and communications markets more significantly than we have in the past so as to have a better mix in terms of gross margins. And we do some things on the finance side to help manage and improve disciplines around cost and pricing to help drive the margins further. So we think all those things are in the cards for us. So at a minimum, we get back to the same gross margins. And hopefully, if we can execute to the things we think we can, we can even do better. Jerald G. Fishman I think that Dave said earlier, one step at a time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Just kind of following up on the expense question. On -- specifically on OpEx, if we get some good growth over the next several quarters, 4 to 8 quarters, are we going to see a catch-up in the variable portion of OpEx that potentially makes OpEx grow faster than sales? Or have you instituted some limits there that keep OpEx to grow below sales growth? David A. Zinsner I think you've seen in the past, we've done a pretty good job of managing OpEx and not letting one component of it drive the behavior of the operating expenses. Our goal is to grow OpEx at a rate that's slower than the revenue growth. We intend to get leverage from the model. So I think you can expect operating expenses to grow at a rate that's below revenue growth. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And as a follow-up question, in the automotive sector, we have seen historically where that's been among your fastest-growing segments. Has something now changed in that segment where perhaps industrial, especially as we see the restocking there, assume the growth leadership over the next few quarters? Or does the content growth and just overall macro get automotive back to that fastest-growing segment? Vincent T. Roche Well, it has been clearly the fastest-growing segment over the past number of years for ADI. Over just the very, very recent short term, the luxury car manufacturers have shown very, very strong output, for example, particularly the German car manufacturers. So I think it's a mixture of -- over the last number of years, it's been a case of the market is just craving technology to differentiate automobiles in general for powertrain, for safety and for entertainment. And we have a good position in all 3 spaces. We're not overly dependent in any 1 area. All 3 areas are growing nicely. So given also that we've raised our R&amp;D investments in that area in the past 3 years and that we're very well-positioned with the mid- to high-end car manufacturers, in particular, across the globe, as I mentioned in the script, that we're also seeing good penetration at this point in time for our technologies in the Asia region. So it's become a global business for ADI. We have very good reach across the applications, broad technology for MEMS to converters, linear RF and so on. So we're very bullish for the long term. And I think it's really a question of what the market deals rather than ADI specifically, I think will be what the market deals us. Jerald G. Fishman I think another clarification would be that in the short term, I think the snapback in industrial will be a little heavier because it went lower, and the inventory went lower relative to historical levels in the industrial market. So in the short term, you might see a factor snap back on the industrial market. But in the longer term, the automotive market still offers great growth prospects. But in the short term, it might be more weighted towards industrial. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research I had a question on the communications end market. And I think when you came into the quarter, you were expecting it to be flattish, and then it ended up down 12% sequentially. What were the deviance from your expectations for the January quarter? Jerald G. Fishman Oh, we had lower orders. I mean, I don't mean to be facetious, but the -- that business is very lumpy, and we don't get a lot of -- some -- a lot of very accurate forecasts since it's very customer-centric and region-centric and deployment-centric. So I think one of the reasons that our sales was lower is we mis-forecast that. And there's a million reasons but basically was that capital spending in that sector was very weak, particularly into year-end, weaker than we had thought. And as a result, our sales were lower. Again, it's very hard to predict because of the concentration of customers, but that's what happened. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research So there wasn't any notable trend in terms of geography or wireless versus wired? Vincent T. Roche No, it was spread across both the primary segments there and... Jerald G. Fishman As we say, our Eastern business and our Western business. Vincent T. Roche Yes. And across fixed, as well as wireless. So it was very broad-based. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. On the 8 weeks of inventory at your channel customers, the -- recognizing that it's kind of like the normal level, when was the last time it was at 8 weeks? Because it's been below 8, I think, for the last year or so. David A. Zinsner Yes, it's been about 1.5 years since we've been at 8 weeks. Jerald G. Fishman I think the important thing is -- what I pointed out earlier is that the weeks when the revenues are changing quickly is not a great indicator. I mean, distributors order parts based on what they were expecting, not what they have seen last quarter. And when there's a transition in the market, the weeks cause you to come to the wrong conclusion. So you have to basically look at the dollars relative to what the expectation we have for next quarter is. And from that standpoint, that's why distributor orders on us were up. David A. Zinsner Yes. I mean, in absolute dollar terms, it was down about $12 million quarter-over-quarter. And we haven't been at this level in absolute dollars since 2010, as low as this since 2010. So this is actually a pretty low level of inventory. It just happens to show up as 8 weeks because of this quarter's revenue level. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao with Merrill Lynch. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division David, in prior cycles, ADI has seen trough-to-peak incremental gross margins of 85% to 90%. Should we expect similar fall-through during this recovery? Or do you think the shift towards more fabless kind of model could result in a lower gross margin fall-through? David A. Zinsner We haven't really had much of a shift. It's been running about 50% internal and 50% external basically since I've been here. So it's been pretty stable. And every quarter, it might move 1 percentage point to the 49% or to the 51% in the external side. So I don't think that has any impact on our gross margin leverage going forward. I would say, on a rough quarter, it probably is kind of a net 80%, 85% fall-through for gross margins. Of course, any quarter can be slightly different based on the mix. The more -- obviously, the more internal we have, the better the fall-through is. But I think it's a rough quarter that's probably in the ballpark. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay, cool. And then, Jerry, consumer sales fell 20% sequentially in January as expected and kind of guided it to be flat in the second quarter. How was your design win momentum on 2013 products? And how do you sale -- how do you see sales playing out over the course of the year in consumer? Vincent T. Roche Our consumer market is the composition of many submarkets, and we very, very carefully picked our places there. You may have noticed, over the last number of years, we've reduced R&amp;D in general in the consumer space. So we're trying to pick those places where we're playing with the market leaders, we're defining problems that are really meaningful to the user experience, that we're able to convince ourselves that we can solve problems that are really meaningful but also that we can invest and maintain a sustainable position. So clearly, I think the momentum for ADI at this point in time is in the portable arena, in particular, but also the imaging area. We have a broader base business in broadcast. It's a reasonably significant part of the consumer space where we have a very, very broad base of products deployed across a lot of customers. So it's a mix but, I would say, dominated by more portable applications in the areas of audio and imaging. Jerald G. Fishman I mean, I think one of the questions that we get quite often is, \"Is consumer going to start to dominate your business? And is it going to be a much larger percentage of your revenues? Because that's one of the places that you get very high growth.\" I think our operating assumption is not that, that we don't expect consumer to grow as a percentage of our sales from where it is now, which is 15% to 16%. That's by design because of the volatility. And it's much harder. And as Vince was saying, to find places where you can sustainably add value over many, many generations. So I think our sense is there's tremendous opportunities for growth for ADI in the infrastructure markets. And at the same time, there are good opportunities for us if we're very selective in the consumer market. But I think if we had to sort of stand and look into the future, we'd probably say that if you look out a couple of years, consumer sales would certainly not increase as a percentage of our sales. And that's certainly not the way -- or that's certainly the way we're investing our very scarce R&amp;D dollars right now. So if we have to make a guess of that over the next couple of years, it would probably be about the same percentage of sales as it is right now, no more, probably not much less. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division I wonder -- the big picture -- if I could look at your industrial business, it looks like you're down about 25% or so over the last 8 quarters. If you look at that across the subsegments of industrial, I remember I had a thesis that stuff like medical equipment or energy might not come down as much as everything else in a macro weakness. Did that prove to be true? Or are there segments of industrial that held up better? Or was it pretty uniform across the subsegments that you track? Vincent T. Roche Well, the -- I think the part of our business that had the biggest downturn was the instrumentation part. Generally speaking, as you know, the industrial business is very, very CapEx-sensitive. So most parts suffered roughly the same, but I'd say instrumentation was down a little more, particularly large items like big iron ATE, for example, automatic test equipment. But also, factory automation suffered, needless to say. There's been a very rapid build-out of plant and equipment in big manufacturing zones in China, for example. So they're taking a bit of a breather, particularly during the past 12, 15 months. But I think, overall, we saw a fairly, evenly distributed downturn in the subsegments, but instrumentation in this past quarter was a little more affected. Jerald G. Fishman I mean, I think over many, many years, our industrial capital spending has been a good trend predictor for our business. And the correlation is very, very tied to that. So typically, what you see is, when industrial capital spending goes down across all those segments that Vince mentioned, our sales react at a very -- very quickly to that. And they also rebound very quickly from that. So it's basically a question of what's going to happen with industrial capital spending around the world over the next couple of quarters. If it turns out that we see some growth in that, reflective of less uncertainty out there, I think our industrial business will do quite well. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Wondering if you could give us an idea if you are more -- your wireless infrastructure is more centric around 3G or 4G. And any kind of split that you may be able to give us a color would be very helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Vincent T. Roche Well, our business -- we have a broad business in 3G. That's the dominant part of ADI's wireless infrastructure business at this point in time. The fastest-growing part of infrastructure for ADI is obviously 4G, given the rapid deployments in the Western and Eastern hemispheres. I'd say, at this point in time, the split, I don't have the absolute accuracy here. But I believe 4G is somewhere in the region of 10% at this point in time. The 3G is probably in the region of 70% and 20% in 2G, but the shift is very clearly towards 3 and 4G. Jerald G. Fishman And that shift has very positive content implications for ADI. The amount of content we have in 4G is higher than it was in 3G due to the breadth of the product offerings. As Vince talked about it, there's certainly more transceivers -- more radio transceivers in future generations than in prior generations. So I think the design-in base we have in 4G or it's equivalent in most locations is very strong, which is why it's one of the reasons why we're enthusiastic. As those deployments accelerate, we hope, in the second half of the year, we should do fine. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Very, very helpful. And then, Dave, I'm not sure if you gave a number for the loading of -- expected loading on the fab for the 2Q time frame. David A. Zinsner I said utilization -- you mean on the utilization base? Is that what you're asking, Harsh? Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Yes. David A. Zinsner So I think I've said in the prepared remarks that utilization will be in the high 50s, [indiscernible] in the mid '50s this quarter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Steven Smigie Dave, just a housekeeping question. If we were to get the R&amp;D tax credit back again for fiscal '14, would you likely run around that same 17% in that year as well? David A. Zinsner Yes. Steven Smigie Okay, great. And then just sort of a higher-level growth question. Overall, if we were to get into a more normalized environment, it seems like -- where it seems like maybe we're trending towards -- given all the dollar content increases you're getting on multiple devices out there, would you be able to achieve something like a 3x GDP growth? Let's say global GDP was 4%, could you hit a 12% growth? Or is 8% to 10% sort of more a reasonable assumption? Jerald G. Fishman It's very hard to tell because it's speculation, but I'd say more the latter than the former. Operator The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Dave, just to start off with you, nice dividend increase here after a substantial dividend increase a year ago. Can you just help us understand what the parameters were that helped you and the board settle on the $0.04 increase? And how do we think about any potential for further increase from here? David A. Zinsner Yes, sure. So one thing I think the board has proven and ADI has proven, that we're pretty committed on the dividend. And maybe more broadly speaking, we're pretty committed to returning cash to shareholders. If you go back to 2003 when we started the dividend, and I think shortly after that, started a pretty meaningful buyback program, we've given back about $6.5 billion to investors over the course of the last, you know what, 9, 10 years. So that's a commitment that they've had in the past. That's a commitment that the board and senior management have in the future. So I think, largely, increases in dividend are going to be dependent obviously on earnings. And as we grow earnings, I think you could expect us to continue to grow the dividend. We think it's a great vehicle to kind of systematically and routinely provide cash back to our investors. You'll still see us do buybacks. We're committed to that program as well. I think we said we have a little over $500 million in the buyback program that exists. We'll go out and get more if we need to. We're going to be a bit more opportunistic on the buyback side. It's going to depend a little bit on the stock price and its relationship to kind of historical averages and things like that. But I think you'll see us be committed both on the buyback and the dividend. I mean, our goal was, historically, we had paid back a payout ratio, I think, of about 40%. Our payout -- our goal was to get the payout ratio up. We didn't have a specific number in mind other than to say we wanted to be -- it to be more meaningful as a percent of our earnings. And that was the basis around why we increased the dividend this quarter. The other thing is, I think we felt like we had some confidence around a quarter, too, that was going to be much better than our first quarter. We felt we were getting our legs under us from the inventory work-downs that we had experienced in the prior few quarters. And so now seems like the appropriate time to ramp the dividend again. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question. And I know there's been a lot of focus on industrials. And this is either for Jerry or Vince. If you look at your end markets, it seems like they're all coming back pretty strongly. But I'm wondering if you can provide some of the same color on a geographic basis. Are you seeing a fairly uniform recovery geographically? Or are there certain geographies that are really leading and others that are lagging? And if so, which would those be? Vincent T. Roche I'd say -- let me start with the weakest. I'd say the recovery in Japan, if there is one, is very, very muted. Europe is getting back to some kind of a strength, but I'd say the better growth is in America and China, somewhere between America and Europe at this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Dave, for you. CapEx for 2013, can you offer a number for us? David A. Zinsner Yes, sure. Our goal is to be around $100 million. I think we put a range in there of $90 million to $120 million or so, give or take. I think right now, the way the trajectory is working, it looks like we're going to land pretty much on the $100 million. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division All right. And can you highlight for us where you think you might run into some capacity constraints? What I'm really looking for here is some sort of impetus in the market where we might find that lead times are to stretch the soonest. David A. Zinsner I don't think we're going to be the great proxy for lead time expansion. We're pretty good at keeping our lead times pretty short. As I mentioned, we're only bringing our utilization up to the high 50s this quarter. We have 121 days of inventory. We have -- we seem to be in pretty good shape on the back-end, but that's the nature of our model. We like to be on the side of keeping our lead times short, not have a lot of double bookings and stuff. At some point, I would imagine some competitors who manage things much more tightly, you might run into that situation. But that's probably not going to be us, Doug. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division All right. If I could, Jerry, for you and Vince. Could you offer some commentary on what you're seeing as far as ASP trends? I know there were some efforts a few years back to try to push some of your ASPs higher. Has that been successful? And do you think you could move your ASP mix over time? Vincent T. Roche Well, it depends very much on the market. In general, by the way, our ASPs are very, very stable. As Jerry mentioned just a little while ago, we are seeing ASP extensions particularly in areas like communications infrastructure where for successive generations of technology deployment, we're just getting more content, more value and per application. The same is true in the automotive space. I would say industrial is very, very stable. But as a corporation, we're always looking for ways to just essentially price the technology that we have to the value we're creating and do our best to hold it. So -- but I think it's true across the board. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, I mean, I think the point that Vince raised, this is exactly the right one, is that there's a lot of ways to get your prices up. One way is you can just go after your customers and say, \"By the way, what you used to buy for x, you're now buying for 1.05x.\" And generally, that doesn't have a happy ending. There are other ways to do it in terms of price management, in terms of making sure that your value keeps going up to customers. And I think we're more on the value creation side than just random price increases, which is not our history and not what our customers expect to do. But when you have 10,000 products that you sell to 100,000 customers, a very small movement to that make a big difference. And there's a lot of more professional price management that we can do that is quite well-anticipated by our customers. So it's really a whole bunch of things, but these things are very long-term programs. And we do see beginnings of movement on some of that stuff. But just to clarify because somebody asked us this question last time, we're not going out just raising prices willy-nilly to customers because we know that doesn't end well. Vincent T. Roche I think you're aware that a large part of our industrial business, for example, goes through the channel, and a large part of that business again is with smaller customers, a lot of products, smaller customers with very, very long life cycles. And that business tends to run off book cost forever. So a large part of our business is essentially transacted once, and we never have to reprice that business again. So most of the critical management of pricing is obviously with larger customers in large market sectors. Jerald G. Fishman One of the other point, I think, that's worth noting is that one of the very unique services that ADI had to offer for many, many years and continues to in the future is we don't discontinue many products. So for these customers that Vince was talking about that has very long life cycles, many of these customers buy our products for 20 years. And a lot of it -- and this is true with the small accounts, it's also true in some of the very large accounts. And when we go out and visit those customers, we hear that, that's a very, very important aspect of what customers really value because when they're not using many parts for application, to go redesign a 20-year-old part out doesn't get them great economic benefit and if the margin causes them great economic pains. So I think we have concluded that, that is very valuable to customers. Our customers are willing to pay us for that because the design costs of changes is so high. So these are really sophistications of our model as compared to vast changes in corporate philosophies. Ali Husain Great. Thank you. Well, that's all our callers for today. As we conclude our Q&amp;A session, I'd like to thank you, all, for your participation. And we look forward to talking with all of you again during our second quarter 2013 earnings call scheduled for May 21, 2013, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time. Thank you.

"content": "    NORWOOD, Mass.---- Analog Devices Inc. , with great sadness, announced today that Jerald G. Fishman passed away suddenly from an apparent heart attack yesterday evening. Mr. Fishman was 67 years old.   This is a terrible loss for me personally and for all of us here at ADI, said Ray Stata, Chairman of the Board. Jerry dedicated his entire career to building ADI into a great companyone of which we all are enormously proud. Jerrys commitment to ADI occupied a central part of his life and his passion for success was infectious. Jerry not only developed enormous respect both inside and outside the company as one of our industrys greatest leaders, but also for those like me who knew him well, he engendered a sense of affection and loyalty through his candor, openness, and integrity and through his unique sense of humor. While Jerry was extraordinarily passionate about his work and ADI, his greatest pride was his family and our thoughts are with them at this time. We shall miss Jerry deeply.   Jerry was born in 1945 and grew up in Flushing, NY. He graduated from the City College of New York with a BSEE degree. He went on to earn an MSEE degree from Northeastern University, an MBA from Boston University, and Juris Doctor degree from Suffolk Law School.   Jerry joined Analog Devices in 1971 in product marketing. His responsibilities and his contributions expanded quickly as he rose through the ranks of the company, and in 1991 he was named President and Chief Operating Officer. In 1996, he was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Jerrys contributions to ADI and the industry were recognized throughout his career.   In accordance with the Companys bylaws, ADIs President Vincent Roche has been appointed Chief Executive Officer on an interim basis by ADIs Board of Directors.   Vince, together with the leadership team Jerry put in place, know the company well and know what they have to do to continue the companys success, said Mr. Stata.     Analog Devices Inc.

Subsequent events and development may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of this live broadcast, which is May 22, 2012. With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO, Jerry Fishman, for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, thanks, Maria, and good afternoon to everybody on the call. Our revenues in our second quarter totaled approximately $675 million, which was up slightly more than 4% sequentially, but down about 15% compared to the year-ago quarter. You might remember the year-ago quarter when ADI revenue peaked, as customers built inventory to reduce the risk of supply disruptions that were widely feared after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The industrial end markets, which are typically seasonally strong for ADI in the second quarter turned even better performance than we had planned and grew about 12% sequential. All of the major application areas within industrial grew sequentially, and it was led by over 20% sequential growth in both instrumentation and in energy. Health care and industrial automation, which includes process control, as well as defense, aerospace and security, also grew sequentially in the second quarter. In general, indications in the industrial market are that customers have stopped depleting inventory and our current orders more closely matched consumption levels, certainly much more closely than had been the case over the last few quarters. In the industrial market, ADI is well recognized as the best brand amongst the wide range of industrial applications, and many of these applications we now believe have the potential for above market growth rates in the future. Revenues also increased sequentially from communications infrastructure customers, as both wired and wireless applications grew about 3% sequentially. Communications order rates began very slowly in the early parts of Q2, but improved significantly toward the end of the quarter. For the past few quarters, operators have worked to increase capacity at minimal cost by implementing software upgrades rather than hardware upgrades. But to date, networks in many regions of the world are very much overloaded, and operators find it difficult to respond to significantly higher bandwidth requirements from applications, such as streaming video by using existing equipment. As a result of new equipment upgrade cycles, ADI's leading technology portfolio and very strong customer relationships with the largest market shareholders in the infrastructure market, we expect our sales into communications applications to grow throughout the second half of our fiscal year and also into 2013. Automotive revenues were down very slightly in the second quarter, but increased 10% year-over-year as a result of strong worldwide vehicle unit growth, increasing electronic content and increasing ADI content in cars. ADI, as you know, is very well-positioned in the major systems in the wide range of automobiles, and we expect the automotive market to continue to offer very strong growth prospects for ADI going forward, as it has over the past 3 to 5 years. Revenues from consumer customers declined 8% sequentially, in line with the seasonally weak second quarter time period for consumer products. However, even in the consumer market, orders from consumer customers picked up late in the second quarter, and we now expect our consumer business will grow sequentially in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter as a result of better underlying demand and I think very importantly, a very strong ADI design-in activity at the top of consumer brands. On a regional basis, all regions except North America experienced sequential increase in both revenue and also in end customer bookings. On a worldwide basis, end customer bookings increased 8% sequentially, and the book-to-bill for the quarter was above 1. Our best sense at this point is that the order expansion that we are experiencing is a result of a combination of the end of customer destocking, a incrementally better outlook at many of our customers and also our distributors and also what we believe is the beginning of what will be a very strong new product cycle at ADI. In aggregate, ADI's second quarter performance was strong on virtually every measure. We met or exceeded our plan for growth and profits for the quarter, and we are continuing to deliver exceptional cash flow. So Dave will now take you through some of the details of our financial results, and after Dave's done, I'll come back and talk a little bit about the outlook going forward. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, second quarter revenue increased 4.2% sequentially and declined 14.6% year-over-year to $675.1 million. Our gross margin was 65.2% in the second quarter. This was up 200 basis points from the 63.2% we reported in the first quarter, driven by a favorable mix of high-margin industrial and communications infrastructure products and increased factory utilization. Second quarter gross margin represented a drop-through of approximately 115% on the incremental sales. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. With these very short lead times from ADI, we are experiencing a very high proportion of orders for delivery in the quarter as our customers understand that our products are readily available rather than customers building long-term backlog to ensure supply. Operating expenses for the second quarter were $227.5 million compared to about $226 million in the prior quarter. The slight dollar increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation and to a lesser degree, annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Operating expenses declined sequentially as a percent of revenue by 120 basis points. And headcount in the second quarter remained essentially flat to the previous quarter's level. Operating profits before tax for the second quarter were $212.9 million or 31.5% of sales. This was 320 basis points higher than the prior quarter's operating profits of 28.3% of sales. Operating profits increased as a result of the higher revenue and increased factory utilization in the second quarter. Other expense was $1.5 million in the second quarter compared to $3.3 million in the first quarter. Our ongoing run rate for net interest expense should be approximately $3 million. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 23%, in line with the prior quarter's 22.6% but higher than our prior expectations. The higher rate was primarily due to a shift in income to higher tax jurisdictions. We expect our effective tax rate in the third and fourth quarter to be approximately 22.5%. Diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the second quarter was at the high end of our guidance as a result of our strong growth from these high-margin products. Cash flow in the second quarter continued to be strong. We generated 33.5% of our revenue or $226 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $30 million, resulting in free cash flow of $196 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter. Our accounts receivable balance increased from the prior quarter by $28 million due to higher sales. However, our days sales outstanding decreased to 45 days from the prior quarter's 46 days. We continue to carefully manage inventory, both at ADI and our distribution partners to keep our total inventory well positioned to respond quickly to customers. In the second quarter, inventory at ADI increased by a modest 2% compared to the prior quarter. On the days of inventory basis, ADI inventory decreased to 118 days from 122 days in the prior quarter. While a bit above our inventory model of a 100 to 110 days, we believe this makes sense given inventory in the channel is still low compared to historical levels, and there was a wide range of possible demand levels for the next few quarters. We remain committed to maintaining very short lead times to avoid double ordering and to provide best-in-class service levels to our customers. During the second quarter, we repurchased $44 million of our stock. We also distributed approximately $89 million or 55% of net income in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the second quarter was approximately $3.8 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion is available domestically. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $863 million in debt outstanding. On May 21, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on June 12, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1. At the current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3.3%. In summary, second quarter delivered solid results. Our operating model turned a 4% sequential increase in revenue into a 15% sequential increase in diluted EPS. At gross margins of 65.2% and operating margins of 31.5%, we still have leverage ahead, as sales increase, factory utilization improves and we continue to prudently manage the growth in operating expenses well below our sales growth rate. And now I'll turn the call back over Jerry to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Thanks, Dave. For the third quarter of 2012, we're planning for our revenues to grow sequentially in the range of 1% to 4%. We're planning for the industrial market to grow sequentially again in Q3, although certainly at a slower rate compared to the very significant sequential rise in Q2, as we enter the seasonally weaker second half of the year for industrial products. As I mentioned earlier, orders from communications infrastructure customers picked up momentum in the latter part of the second quarter. And as a result, our third quarter plan for communications infrastructure is for sales also to grow sequentially. We expect automotive revenues to be about flat sequentially in Q3 and revenues from consumer applications to grow sequentially as a result of seasonality and also what we expect to be a very strong new product cycle for our consumer products. We're planning for gross margins to increase approximately 50 basis points from the 65.2% we achieved in Q2, which if we achieve the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we'll generate more than 80% in drop-through on incremental sales. We anticipate operating expenses of approximately $231 million, a slight increase primarily as a result of a full quarter with the annual salary increases that went into effect in April and variable compensation increasing as margins continue to improve. Based on those estimates and excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.58 in the third quarter. So in closing, while the data we have points to 3Q being another solid quarter for ADI, we continue to be mindful of the global macro-environment that we are operating in. We're very focused on providing our customers with the very best technical support and the most responsive supply chain. Internally, of course, we're focusing on the things that we can control, bringing breakthrough products to the market, looking for continuing efficiency gains wherever we spend money and wherever we apply resource and engaging every employee at Analog in the fight to get higher sales and higher margins. Maria Tagliaferro Thank you. Thank you, Jerry. Thank you, Dave. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Doug Freedman from RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division If I could, I guess, I'll start with just the revenue line. It does appear to be a little light of where we might think business might be if we were in sort of a normal semiconductor, if there is such a thing, recovery cycle. Can you comment on how you think the macro-environment is impacting your customer base and maybe if you guys have taken any actions of your own as a result of the nervousness out in the marketplace? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think, Doug, the only thing that we could do is be suitably cautious given all the sort of macroeconomic issues out there. I think it's at the margin that makes our customers worry a little bit more than they would if everything was going well in every geography. But no, I still sense that most of our customers are looking out there and saying things are pretty good and that they're expecting to get growth. Typically, our third quarter seasonality is all over the map. There were some third quarters we actually grow 5% or 6% to 7%; other ones, we contract 4% to 6%, other ones are right in the middle. In fact, if you look at the average for the last 3 years, each one of which was a unique year. The average of those last 3 years was about 2% third quarter. So I think what we're trying to do is listen to all the positive vibes we're getting from the customers and make sure we have capacity in response to that. But yet internally, manage the company to try to keep as much flexibility as we can in case the macroeconomic situation gets worse. Now, Vince, you have some other -- you've been out there talking to -- particularly the industrial investor. Vincent T. Roche Yes. If you look at the geographic context on this thing, I would say from a number of conversations I've had with our large distributors, as well as our customers, particularly in the industrial sector, I'd say there's a general sense that Europe still has to work through the crisis. People have been very, very careful in terms of laying out cash, particularly for CapEx-oriented equipment. I think the inventories are going to be very, very lean. But I think we're at a point now as well where the inventories at our customers have got a very healthy and in line with consumption rates. I think the sense is that, that America is pretty stable. Everybody's watching China -- there are mixed reports in China. Some see it as very, very strong for the next couple of quarters, some not so strong. And Japan also seems to be pretty stable. Jerald G. Fishman So I think really the summary comment is that if we just listen to the feedback we're getting from our customers, we might put out more optimistic plan for next quarter. But I think we have to be cautious when you listen to what's going on macro-economically. And that's what I think our guidance reflects. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Great. If I could, for my follow-up just on the comment you made, Jerry, regarding a strong product cycle in the consumer segment that you're expecting. Can you just remind us, does that consumer segment include your handsets? And would that be -- if you could offer some more color there, that would be helpful. Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think -- as you know, when we've talked about previously, we really narrowed down our focus in the consumer business for those areas that we really think we can make not only a significant technology contribution but one that will last more than a few months or a few calendar quarters. And I'd say where our product offering is particularly strong right now is in the portable side. And that encompasses many different types of portable formats. And particularly in the audio and image processing, dimensions of that. So we have good products that represents a lot of mainstream analog technology, and based on the feedback we're getting from some of the top consumer companies, the design-in rate of those products seems pretty good. And if we believe their forecast for the second half, that should raise our consumer business in the next couple of quarters. But it's mostly focused on the portable area, I would say. Operator The next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster from Macquarie. Deepon Sen Gupta  This is Deepon for Shawn. Could you actually just talk about the current quarter where you're seeing orders from the end market and geographic perspective? Do you see order rates pick up? I know there's some talk about some order rates and maybe very strong for some of your competitors? Vincent T. Roche Yes. I'd say over the last couple of months, what we've seen is stabilization on the industrial side and a pickup in the communications infrastructure orders, in particular. The automotive also has been a great growth driver for the company over the last few years. And in order continues to be strong. My expectation is that in the second half and the 3Q that based on the order trends we're seeing, that market will behave pretty well for us as well. Deepon Sen Gupta  And when you're thinking the out-quarter, can you talk about where utilization rate is going to go and how much benefit we should see from utilization rate or how much we should see from mix? And also if you could give the utilization rates for the past quarter, that will be about helpful as well. David A. Zinsner So utilization in the second quarter was about 70%. We're expecting utilization to be in that range for the third quarter. It did pick up from, I think, it was 67-ish percent the prior quarter. So it added probably 50 basis points or so. The mix certainly contributed as well. What was your other question related to that? Deepon Sen Gupta  So just going forward, how do we anticipate mix impacting gross margins? David A. Zinsner Well, utilization's going to be flat. So I don't think that, that's going to benefit -- at the moment, we're predicting that mix will be relatively similar to what it was in the second quarter. So I doubt that, that will have much benefit. Really the improvement will get in the gross margin sequentially is going to be more just from the higher revenue level. Operator Next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital. Emily Scudder This is Emily calling in for Ambrish. Can you discuss what regions are driving the growth in your communications infrastructure end market segment, and what regions you're expecting to be the strongest contributors to ADI in the second half of the fiscal year and fiscal '13? Vincent T. Roche Yes. I mean, all regions in the second quarter registered growth. America was relatively flat. But all regions grew. My expectation is that given what we're seeing on the end market side, there won't be much change in terms of the regional mix in, I believe, the third quarter. Jerald G. Fishman I think also our question was more related to communications. Vincent T. Roche Yes. On the communications side, well as you know, our business in the communication sector is very, very global. We supply products to all the sectors of equipment, such as GSMs, all the 3G standards, WCDMA, TD-SCDMA, LTE on the 4G side. And I think particularly in America, you're going to see some significant capital deployments in the third and fourth quarter and also China. So I think Europe is probably on communications infrastructure side going to be somewhat tepid, but that's my sense based on what we heard from customers and what carriers seemed to be saying. And Japan has been quite good both on the wired and wireless side over the last quarter or 2. My expectation is that will remain steady. Emily Scudder Okay. And then can you comment on what your expectations are as far as distributor inventory as we exit this quarter, and how that might vary by the different regions? David A. Zinsner Yes. Days of inventory right now at distribution is around 7.5 weeks, that's a little bit below the target, which I think we generally think of as 8 weeks. I would guess, over time, that will migrate its way up to 8 weeks, but we don't have any insight as to when that will happen. And I think that it's pretty consistent across the geographies. Vincent T. Roche Yes. I think given the strength in supply as well, I think distributors are not incentivized, there's any particular reasons to hold at this point in time. Jerald G. Fishman And we're not incentivizing to give it to them. Operator Next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division I guess first question, Jerry, you talked about conservatism or cautious given the macro picture, but at the same time, it sounds like your visibility, particularly on the comm and consumer side is a little bit better. So I guess what I'm trying to ask and ask it directly is if we didn't have this kind of macro uncertainty, what kind of top line growth do you think we could see in Q2? Jerald G. Fishman I mean that's very hard to predict. I'd say just qualitatively, the only I can say is that if we had more macro certainty, we were sure that the economy was going to be no worse than neutral, I think our expectations for revenues will be higher. How much and what that number is, I'd just be guessing. And I don't think that serves either of us. But certainly, that macroclimate is -- I mean you have to be sobered by it. You can't see what's going on or read the newspaper every day and listen to all the commentary and not at least be a little concerned about how that might impact our business. So I think that's what our guidance is reflecting. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Okay. I guess have you seen a pullback in terms of customers' asks? And it's flowing into your order book? Or is this more of a more cautionary stance just heading into what you may think you're going to see? Jerald G. Fishman I think it's more of the latter than the former. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Great. If I could just ask one last question, Dave. What should we be thinking about for tax rate in fiscal '13? David A. Zinsner I would plan it to be somewhere in the 22% range. Operator Next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division So if we took all the macro uncertainty we all read about, what do you think your best guess would be for whatever is close to a normal seasonal quarter this quarter? And then what would be a normal seasonal quarter for next quarter in terms of revenue growth? Jerald G. Fishman I think the best way I can answer that is that we haven't had this seasonally normal quarter in 3 years. David A. Zinsner 4 years. Jerald G. Fishman 4 years, actually, Dave reminds me. So I think the trends for each of the market segments is much more dominant than the seasonality that we see. In the earlier days when our business was mostly military, industrial and so on, it was pretty easy to just figure that out. But I think with consumer business, the communications business, automotive businesses, those are not businesses that respond to typical seasonality as compared to what's going on in those particular market segments that are more on a secular way of thinking about it than a seasonal way of thinking about it. So very hard to predict. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we went back and looked at seasonality for the last 3 or 4 years, and we couldn't figure out what it was, looking at all the data, of 16 quarters worth of data to try to figure out seasonal patterns. We couldn't figure out any seasonality, so very hard to predict that. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Can you tell us what sort of turns business you're expecting this quarter, and then what it was last quarter? What would be typical? David A. Zinsner Chris, our standard response on that is we don't really quote that number, only because most or at least half of our revenue is distributor based, so we have the backlog coming in from the distributors, but we don't recognize it until it ships out. I mean I think Jerry said qualitatively that we're in a higher turns like environment. We don't put a number to it. But nevertheless, clearly, customers are not layering in tons of backlog. They're not ordering until they really need it. And so we have quoted 4-week lead times, about how much time it takes from the time we get an order to the time we're shipping at this point. Jerald G. Fishman And in fact, the large part of the product lines are quite a bit less than 4 weeks. In fact, it's probably 4 hours. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Uche Orji from UBS. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Jerry, can I just ask you a question and I'm -- probably something I don't fully understand. You talked about some of the infrastructure customers to be more of a software upgrade rather than a hardware upgrade. Any comment as to what extent you were able to stretch that and in what types of technologies? I mean is it within 3G or I think another 3G level? And why you think that they will have to stop that now and do more of a hardware upgrade? I just want to get a bit more insight as to the comment. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. Vince, is going to answer that. Vincent T. Roche Most of our business, the GSM or 2G component of our businesses is becoming smaller and smaller over time, so most of the, if you like, the upgrades that are being managed through software largely in 3G systems today. But it's only so far that, that will get you because every year, data requirements are increasing twofold. There's 90 million 4G-enabled handsets out there today, and they all require with an insatiable appetite for more and more bandwidth, which is driving -- this data is driving the need for expanded bandwidth RF transceivers. That's our game in the wireless arena and higher frequency requirements as well across multiple different geographies with different spectrum needs. So our sense is from talking to some carriers, talking to our customers, the second half of this year is going to see an upgrade in the equipment at the 3G and particularly 4G level. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay. Well, that's helpful. Let me just ask a different question. Jerry, in terms of understanding the target inventory for customers, I mean, I think what Dave explained that the target is for 8 weeks and you're currently at 7.5 weeks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's in distribution. Just to clarify things... Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division In distribution exactly, distribution. Let me understand it. I mean because we've -- last year, I think starting from 2009, there was all this talk about inventory moving down to slightly lower level over time because of improvements in VMI. And is there any reason why we shouldn't assume 7.5 weeks is now the new normal and why 8 weeks will be -- and the reason I ask this is because it kind of influences our assumption about a future tailwind coming from inventory restocking. Is that -- do you think 7.5 weeks is kind of where we should be modeling now, in which case we can conclude was normalized in terms of channel inventory? Jerald G. Fishman I think there's no meaningful distinction between 7.5 weeks and 8 weeks. Maybe 7.5 is the new norm or 7.2 or 8.3. We just don't know. But we're saying that it doesn't impact much what we do. So whether the new norm is 7.5 or the new norm is 8, I mean we're going to still do the same thing. We're going to have inventory available when our customers or distributors need it. And that's what we've done through the last couple of cycles and it significantly improved our competitive position relative to those who tried to, call it, more tightly than that. And I think that's what we're going to do going forward. I think there is no meaningful distinction to us of how we operate the business whether the new norm is 7.5 or 8 weeks. David A. Zinsner In particular because we don't recognize the revenue until it ships out from the distributor. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. So let's say it doesn't impact anything the way we run the business. So if we could be equally predictive on other measures in Analog, I'd be quite happy. Operator Next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Somewhat related question on inventory. Just to be clear, does your guidance assume any customer restocking in the out-quarter? Or is the growth in the quarter just coming from some combination of a pickup and then demand and/or customers just continuing to get their orders back in line with their demand? Jerald G. Fishman Again, it's hard to be quantitatively precise to answer your question. But I'd say that lion's share of what our guidance includes is customer's order and consumption. That's where we think most customers are in their thinking right now. Vincent T. Roche Our customers are indicating that the -- across the broad customer base particularly in the infrastructure area, the CapEx area like industrial and communications infrastructure that their inventories are at a very normal level now and very much in line with consumption. So I think that, that cycle overbuild is finished and customers are back to a normal order pattern. Jerald G. Fishman I mean I think in the de minimis level, there are still some customers that are destocking that we've heard of and there are some customers that are going to restock a little bit. But the predominant mode most customers are in, and we've said that we believe they're going to be ordering what they use. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division That's helpful. And for a follow-up, as we go through these cycles, normally what happens is something causes lead times to begin to stretch out a little bit and that's what starts the customers to reorder a little more, build a little more inventory or move away from the high-turns components that they're putting on you guys right now? Last time, obviously it was testing capacity that caused lead times to stretch. Other cycles, it's been other things. I know it's difficult to predict, but what kinds of things do you see out there that could potentially cause lead times to stretch out a little bit this quarter and kind of begin that cycle all over again? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we can only speculate about that. Certainly, we've heard anecdotes about foundry capacity getting a little bit tighter. We know that many of the assembly test subcontractors are thinly capitalized, so they don't carry a lot of extra capacity. So I think if the order trends start getting more confirmed and more positive, I think most semiconductor companies are reporting an improved order environment. I think if that continues with the relative scarcity of capacity out there, I think lead times for those that aren't thinking about it clearly could extend. Our goal is to not have that happen. Our goal is to really stay on top of this and keep our lead times in the range that they've been in. And if we do that, then that creates no need for customers to double or triple order and confuse us, and by definition, our investors. So I mean our goal is to really watch that carefully and keep the lead times short. It helps our customers, it helps you, it helps us. And that's what we're going to do with the cycle, just like we did in the last cycle. Those are the pressure points, typically. I think most semiconductor manufacturers have capacity in sight that's available to ramp up. We certainly do. So I think the pressure points will likely be on the outside, not necessarily on the inside. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division This is Aashish Rao for Vivek. A couple questions on the consumer front. In January, I think, you had indicated that Thailand floods had impacted some of the consumer in home entertainment builds, and you'd also indicated that your expected consumer to be up slightly in April. But then sales kind of declined 8% quarter-on-quarter. I mean could you give some color on that? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we were wrong. I think our consumer business, just across many different segments of it went down. Part of it was inventory that got a little too high, higher than we had thought. Secondarily, there were some products that -- in some end markets that weren't selling particularly well. The consumer cycle was not a strong cycle in the last 3 months. So I think those things qualitatively made our estimate wrong. We were also wrong in the industrial side where we thought it was going to be much lower than it is. And these parts of the cycle at the inflection points, it's very challenging to figure out what the aggregate is going to be, and I'd say even more challenging to figure out what any of the individual segments are going to do at least in the short term. I think that's part of the challenge now with all the changes that are going on to try and figure out the segment growth. We try to give you the internal plan that our product and market salespeople have in each of those segments. We try to give you a little more color at least directionally where we think it's going to happen. But very typically, we're happy to get the aggregate right. The individual categories are very volatile. It's very hard to get that correct. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay, got it. And then it just sounded also on the call that you are excited about some new product cycles in the consumer segment and this is even after the divestitures of the computing and the handset, x those products, I mean your sales from, say, fiscal year '10 and you're averaging about $155 million or so a quarter. I mean right now you're at $108 million. I mean is this just the cyclical recovery that you're expecting in consumer? Or are there really some new product cycles? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I'd say it's predominately new products that we've refocused on as we've decreased investments in consumer products that we didn't think fit well with our long-term portfolio. So I think we've decreased investments. In some of those areas, we refocused them on areas that we think are suitable for the product mix and the margin models that we have for the company. And I think those products will be well received. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. So should we expect any kind of the growth rate target you have for this business off the bottom? Jerald G. Fishman Why don't you give us a couple more quarters, and then we'll talk about it? Operator Next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division David, I was hoping you could comment on any internal efforts you guys are making in terms of gross margin improvements? Basically just looking for an update on some of the pricing strategy efforts you've been making and some of the efforts on making products more easy to -- or more efficiently to manufacture? David A. Zinsner Yes, I mean all of those are progressing. And I think we're in kind of middle innings of making improvement in both those areas. We do believe there will be tailwinds to our gross margin. The biggest thing, of course, that will improve the gross margin is to get the utilization up. And so getting the business back to the levels we saw in 2011, I think, would have been the biggest driver for gross margin. Jerald G. Fishman I think last time, our gross margin got up to about 67%. There is a lot of conversations about were those anomalous or were there onetime things that were driving that up, because it was so much higher than it's been in Analog, at ADI historically. I think the fact that we got back over 65%, at below 60 -- $700 million of revenues is a very good sign that the kind of improvements that we made are not fleeting, that they're permanent and that we have pretty good expectations on the gross margins for the company as revenues build, as Dave said. I think that those numbers this quarter on the gross margin were very encouraging to us. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Right. And just as a follow-up on that, to what extent can you get, let's say in a better more normalized macro-environment, to what extent can you get above that, the 67%? And just to sneak one more in, can you talk a little bit about what OpEx dollars might look like over the next several quarters assuming some modest sequential revenue growth, I mean as we sort of reach the dollar plateau here now that you've added in these extra items you mentioned earlier? Or is that -- will that still keep expanding? Jerald G. Fishman Dave, I'll turn it over to you on the expected, then I'll talk a little bit about the margins. David A. Zinsner Okay. So on the OpEx side, we are expecting it to obviously increase this quarter. It's a little bit, I think, a little around half the rate of the revenue growth. We did better than that, obviously, in the current quarter. And that's generally our goal, to try to expend -- grow expenses at a rate that's below the rate of revenue growth, get good fall through to the operating margin line. Jerald G. Fishman I think on the question of the margins, the margins are a combination of price and cost. Somebody asked earlier, we're continuously ensuring that we get paid fairly for our products. So I think that helps us. We're continuously setting tougher cost objectives on the products. Our goal is to be -- from here to be increasing the gross margin sequentially as the revenues go up. And if we continue to do that, I think everyone will be very happy with the gross margins we get. Operator The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, I appreciate the candid acknowledgment to the uncertain macro. As you look around today and assess the backdrop that you have, how would you compare it to the same time last year? What are the positives and what are the headwinds? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think this time last year, we were really worried that not only were there sort of macro issues developing, but there was a significant amount of inventory that was in the channel out there. People really inventoried up much more so than we or anybody else have thought during the earthquakes and tsunamis that happened around that time. And so we were faced with a situation where you had macro sort of demand issues, at the same time you had very significant inventory out there with our customers and in the distribution channel. And the intersection of those 2 things took a big whack out of all of us. I think where we are today is -- we still have macroeconomic issues, some would argue that they're closer to getting resolved, some would take a different point of view on that. But certainly this time, relative to what consumption rates are, there's not a lot of inventory out there that channels compound that issue. So I think from that standpoint, Craig, I think we feel like there's less downside with -- than there was a year ago at this time. And I think at the same time, with the customer cycles that we're hearing about from our customers, I think there's more upside potential. So qualitatively, I think sitting here today a year after all those events last year, we're feeling better than we feel a year ago. It's certainly not without risk, but better. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division That's helpful. And then a follow-up for you, Dave. You guys did a great job with the dividend increase a quarter ago. And just by that and buying back stock the cash balance still moved up. So how should we think about how you're thinking about cash management? David A. Zinsner Well, we're obviously anxious to return the cash in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. I think we'll continue to do that. Obviously we built a lot -- or we generate a lot of cash, which is a high-class problem. But, however, I think you will see us continue to be committed in both buybacks and dividend growth going forward. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division And what's the percentage of cash that's in the U.S. versus overseas at this point? David A. Zinsner I think I mentioned we have $1.1 billion in the U.S. The rest is overseas. Operator The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division For the first one, how do we think about the impact of what sounds like a very strong potential consumer cycle into the back half in 2013 on gross margins? Can you talk a little bit about some of the drivers of margin into the back half and as we exit the year around product mix given some of those cycles around utilizations and growth as well, maybe some of the other initiatives that you're targeting? Jerald G. Fishman I think on the consumer side, I wouldn't want to let the expectations run away with us here. What -- the reason we mentioned it is that we've been very clear that we were really narrowing our reach in the consumer business to applications that add a lot of value to the customers and, therefore, were valuable to us. And I think we're beginning to see the fruit of that. I don't think -- we're talking about numbers that are going to fundamentally change the needle. I think consumer applications typically carry somewhat lower gross margins than the average, particularly in the industrial business. But at the same time, they carry very high operating margin since below the line, there's not a lot of expense. So I think carefully managed and carefully executed consumer business is a fine business. It shows you how to be very careful of what you do and who you do it with, or who you do it for in order -- so you don't get banged around by product cycles that are out of your control and margins that result from being in that vise. So I think it's important, and I want to clarify that we're not talking about any huge disruption here that all of a sudden, we're going to have a lot more consumer revenue than we've had historically. It's just we have couple good product cycles incrementally, it's going to make our computer business grow a little bit, it's been declining -- or our consumer business rather will grow a little bit where it's been declining, and I think that's going to help the top line a little bit. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. So to be clear, you don't foresee mix, I guess, turning a little more negative on the gross margin front as we exit the year then? Jerald G. Fishman Given Dave's guidance on the gross margin, I don't think so. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. And for my follow-up, sequentially on the automotive market, auto has been very strong for you and for a number of other players for the last few quarters. What's your point of view on the stability of that auto strength, again, as we -- as we're cycling for the rest of the year, maybe into 2013? Do you think that what we're seeing is actually a stable unit growth? Is there any chance that what we're seeing potentially is pull forward of demand? Can you give us some view of how much of the upside you've seen is actually been unit growth versus overall electronic content increasing versus your design win traction increasing? Vincent T. Roche It looks like this year, the number of cars that are sold worldwide will reach maybe 80 million, up about 5%. And the content, the electronic content per car continues to increase. From our perspective, we're very well positioned. We play with all the leaders worldwide. We have a particularly strong position with European OEMs who are doing extraordinarily well in the world market, particularly in America and Asia. So my sense is that the growth pattern we've seen will continue for the remainder of the year if we have another good year in automotive, and for the next number of years as well. So all the indications are that we'll see a growth here in terms of units, car units and growth in electronic content. So we're feeling very positive about it. Operator Next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Bheeshm Chaudhary - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division This is Bheeshm Chaudhary for Ross. Just a quick question. I was curious what your revenue guidance would be for the next quarter if you recognize distribution sales on a -- or distribution revenue on a sell-in basis? David A. Zinsner We have no idea. We don't measure it that way, and so we don't pay any attention to it. Jerald G. Fishman Although, I expect it will be higher. Operator The next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda from ISI Group. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division One question I have on the comm infrastructure stuff where you're expecting a pickup in the back half. I guess my question was, is that just based on a general sense that spending needs to revive? Or do you have some specific indication from your customers, perhaps in specific geographies that suggest that you'll indeed see a nice pick up in the third and the fourth quarter of this year? Vincent T. Roche Well, for example, China Unicom, who's a WCDMA operator, they've been very vocal as have AT&amp;T about the LTE deployment. So I think if you look at some of the carriers, they're being a lot more aggressive and determine on what they're going to do in the second half. And our customers also are seeing their order books firm up. So I think it's not just wishful thinking. My sense is based on the order streams that we're seeing in the last couple of months and what we're hearing from our customers and the carriers, that there is real demand in the market to continue to build out macrocells in particular. And I think over the next 18 months, which you're going to see is a very aggressive move towards small cell architectures as well to supplement the macrocells. So our expectation, by the way, over the coming few years, this year, there will be somewhere in the region of -- I believe, somewhere in the region of 1 million macrocells in production, deployed I should say, 1.1 million, 1.2 million. And what we're expecting is over the next 3 to 4 years, that, that will probably triple or quadruple. So there's going to be a major build-out that we're kind of gliding into over the next 2 to 3 quarters, I believe. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay, that was very helpful. And then for my follow-up, Dave, I know you don't guide to turns, but perhaps you could tell us what do you think, it's directionally up, down or flat, and/or whether you expect any difference in distributor versus OEM sales or order patterns through the course of July quarter? David A. Zinsner It is down, I would say, probably directionally, as Jerry kind of made a comment about it, I think, early on that qualitatively, we think that increasingly that particularly the OEM customers are shortening their lead times and putting more on turns basis. As far as OEMs versus disty I believe our expectation is that OEMs will be growing a little bit faster than disty the next quarter. Operator And the next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Looking forward, can you tell us what are your highest priorities are in terms of either product segments or end market segments for R&amp;D investment? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think the way we look at R&amp;D is now everything we're doing is a priority, because all the ones that weren't, we're not doing anymore. So that's a simple way to look at it. There are market segments or product segments in each of the end markets that we believe are very favorable and a good match to the technology that we have, where we can offer products our competitors can't do. So I don't think that there's any one particular market that we're favoring more than the others. If we are investing R&amp;D in a market, then we think it's a good -- we're going to get a good return on it or we're not going to invest. So I think the segments that we've talked about, the industrial segments, there is 10 or 11 segments in there, the communications infrastructure market, the consumer market, particularly as related to portable products, I think those are all high priorities for us, which is why we're putting a fair amount of R&amp;D into all those things. Maria Tagliaferro Okay. Well, I believe that was the last question that we had in the queue. So that brings us right up to the 6:00 hour. Jerald G. Fishman Very disciplined, good. Maria Tagliaferro Yes. So we want to thank everyone for joining us. Just as a reminder, the third quarter earnings call is scheduled for August 21, and that will start again at 5 p.m. Eastern time. I appreciate your attention today, and have a great evening. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Ms. Kohl you may begin your conference. Mindy Kohl Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Mindy Kohl, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you haven't yet seen our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 release, you can access it by visiting our website at www.analog.com and clicking on the headline in the News section of our homepage. This conference call is also being webcast live. From analog.com, select Investor Relations and follow the instructions shown next to the microphone icon.  A recording of this conference call will be available today, within about 2 hours of this call's completion, and will remain available via telephone playback for one week. This webcast will also be archived at our IR website. Participating in today's call are Jerry Fishman, President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; Robbie McAdams, Vice President of Core Products and technologies; and Vincent Roche, Vice President of Strategic Market Segments and Worldwide Sales.  During the first part of the call, Jerry and Dave will present our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results, as well as our short-term outlook. The remainder of the time will be devoted to answering questions from our analysts and investor participants. During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain nonrecurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website.  In addition, we have updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary of P&amp;Ls for continuing operations, as well as historical quarterly and annual information for revenue from continuing operations by end markets and product type. Please note that effective Q4, we changed the revenue classifications of our handset and computer businesses.  Our handset revenues, previously included in communications, has been moved to consumer, which is aligned with how this business is managed internally. As a result, our communications revenue category now consists solely of comms infrastructure, which is also aligned with our internal management of this business.  In addition, we folded our computer business, too small to be broken out on its own, into consumer, which it most resembled in terms of market dynamics, products and in some cases, customer.  On our latest web schedules we restated the last 12 fiscal quarters to reflect these changes. Next, I'd ask you to please note that the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will have some time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is November 21, 2011. With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald G. Fishman Well, good afternoon and thanks for joining us on today's call. As you read in this afternoon's earnings release, ADI's revenues for Q2 were about $716 million, which was down 6% sequentially, and 7% year-over-year, and at the low end of the guidance that we've provided to you last quarter. Our sequential revenue decrease was primarily the result of declines in industrial and communications sector revenues.  Our Q4 revenues in automotive increased sequentially, and consumer revenues were seasonally stronger than in Q3. For the year, our total revenues increased 8.4% to just about $3 billion. Although our full year revenue was right on our plan for our fiscal 2011, the quarter-to-quarter volatility was very pronounced, mostly as a result of industry supply imbalances that dominated the landscape through much of the year, along with European sovereign debt and U.S. deficit concerns that have been more recently concerns in the market, and have created industry-wide uncertainty in virtually every geography.  Perceived supply disruptions early in the year, quickly turned into excess inventory, at customers and distributors in the second half of the year. As a result, early in the year order rates for our products were well above consumption rates, and in the second half of the year, order rates appeared to be well below consumption rates. Well after many years in this business we see it's very unusual for order rates to very closely match consumption in any particular period. 2011 was extreme, in that excess demand turned into excess supply so quickly.  Despite the volatility during 2011, ADI had a very good year in aggregate. As I mentioned earlier, revenues grew in line with our long-term model, and reached just about $3 billion for the first time in our history. Gross margin increased once again to 66.4% for the year, and operating expenses grew only 2% on an 8.4% sales increase. As a result, our non-GAAP diluted earnings grew to $2.72, which is a 15% increase from the prior year.  We also generated $778 million or 26% of sales in free cash flow. While in the short-term our revenue is mostly outside our control, we believe we did a very credible job reacting to the environment, and getting the upside in 2011 when it was available and also protecting the downside when market conditions turned somewhat negative.  As the macroeconomic environment deteriorated over the last 2 quarters, we at ADI reacted very quickly, we lowered production rates to minimize inventory, and all discretionary spending in the company. Our variable compensation levels also declined, as they were designed to do, to modulate profit volatility. But of course, the real question that's on everybody's mind is where are we in the cycle. As we know here at ADI, downturns caused by inventory imbalances rarely last more than 2 to 3 quarters. So by that measure, most of the revenue decline caused by inventory reductions should be completed in our current quarter or our first fiscal quarter.  Most of the revenue declines that have occurred in the industrial and communications markets, which represent about 2/3 of our revenue, and are very closely aligned with overall capital spending worldwide. Our customers in those markets have reduced their expectations somewhat for 2012, but in general are still expecting 2012 to be a growth year over 2011. In fact, our 2012 forecast from our largest customers in these markets currently reflect that what I would call guarded optimism.  But right now, the world continues to be a very uncertain place in every region of the world and the range of possible outcomes for the year as a whole is very wide. So as we construct our operating plans for 2012, which has began a few weeks ago, we're guided by the following principles: number one, we are in a growth business, which should provide a rate of growth well ahead of that growth rate of the semiconductor market, by virtue of the fact that we're well-positioned in the fastest growth segments of the semiconductor market, with highly differentiated products that really do create real value for our customers; number 2, we're in a business that provides the opportunity to earn exceptional margins as a result of this significant value that we do provide to our customers.  For ADI, it's really all about execution against our objectives more so than the opportunity that's available to us, which even in bad times remains considerable in size. Number 3: we believe that we're spending an adequate amount of money on R&amp;D to achieve our growth goals. As result, our primary focus is on resource allocation. As we have discussed previously, we will continue to reevaluate and to optimize our product in market portfolio to ensure that we're investing the right amount of resource in the right products and in the right markets.  While this is a very deliberative process, we have in the past and we will continue to change the allocation of resources, when the market opportunity or the competitive dynamics in any particular market or product segment changes drastically. Number 4: ADI will continue to focus on maintaining and evolving our flexible supply chain to keep our lead times very short and responsive to customers' needs, and to continue to provide industry-leading quality levels to our customers. Number 5: we will keep a significant amount of our costs as variable given all the industry volatility that keeps coming at us year after year. And lastly, number 6, we should continue to generate very significant free cash flow, which provides us with the opportunity to enhance shareholder returns, with increasing dividends and opportunistic stock buybacks.  So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave, who will take you through some of the details of our fourth quarter and our full year results, and I'll make some additional comments regarding what's going on in some of the market segments, and also our short-term outlooks, after Dave completes his remarks. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, fourth quarter revenue declined 6% sequentially, and 7% year-over-year to $716 million. And for the year, we grew revenue 8.4% to $3 billion. Our gross margin was 64.3% in the fourth quarter, this was down from 67.2% we reported in the third quarter due to a greater mix of consumer and automotive versus industrial revenue, and the impact of lower factory utilization to 73%, down from 78% last quarter.  This enabled us to bring down inventory levels, both on our balance sheet as well as the balance sheet of our distributors. Inventory on our balance sheet declined by 1% and was down in days from 110 days to 105 days. Inventory at distribution decreased by 11%, and was down below the typical 8 weeks that distributors carry. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, including $2.2 million of restructuring charges, declined by $6 million or 2% from the prior quarter, to $225 million, primarily, as a result of lower variable compensation cost.  As you know, the variability of our operating expenses enables us to react quickly in times when revenue is lower. In addition, we continue the discretionary cost controls we implemented at the end of the third quarter, which also helped reduce expenses this quarter. We plan to continue to carefully manage expenses in our first quarter. Operating profits for the fourth quarter were $235 million or 32.9% of sales compared to 36.8% of sales in the prior quarter.  Operating profits were down both in dollar and percentage terms as a result of the lower revenue and reduced factory absorption in the fourth quarter. Other expenses of $4 million in the fourth quarter was flat to Q3, and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20.6%. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 22% in fiscal 2012, which is up from 2011, as result of potentially losing the R&amp;D tax credit.  If Congress extends the tax credit, our tax rate will likely be approximately 21.5%. Diluted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.60 compared to $0.71 in the prior quarter, and $0.73 in the same period a year ago. For the year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.72, a 15% increase from the prior year. In addition to the solid profitability, we maintained very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter, generating 32% of our revenue or $230 million in operating cash flow.  Capital expenditures were $26 million, resulting in free cash flow of $204 million or 28% of revenue for the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares or $83 million worth of ADI stock, and distributed $75 million in dividends to our shareholders. At current stock prices, our dividend yield is 2.8%. For the full year, we repurchased 9 million shares or $330 million worth of ADI stock, and distributed $282 million in dividends.  Since the inception of the stock repurchase plan and the dividend program beginning in fiscal 2004, ADI has paid out almost $6 billion in dividends and stock buyback, demonstrating our strong commitment to returning cash to our shareholders. On November 18, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on December 21, 2011, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2.  We closed the year with $3.6 billion in cash, of which $1.2 billion or 33% is in the U.S. Net cash, excluding approximately $900 million in debt, was $2.7 billion at the end of the year. Our accounts receivable balance decreased from the prior quarter by 7% due to lower sales and our days sales outstanding decreased by one day from the prior quarter to 44 days. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter, and are in good control with 100% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 6 weeks and 99% within 4 weeks.  In summary, 2011 was an excellent year across multiple dimensions as Jerry described earlier. Although the fourth quarter was certainly weaker than other quarters within the year, we reacted by controlling that which was within our control, namely inventory builds and operating expenses, to ensure that our fourth quarter profitability was maximized, and that the company is well-positioned to capture the upside when the business environment turns more positive. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry who will discuss the results from each of our end markets, and provide a short-term outlook. Jerald G. Fishman It is Jerry again. Let me give you -- try and give you a little bit of color on what has happened in each of the end markets and what would be logical to assume going forward. In the industrial market for the full fiscal year, our revenues, which includes industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare, grew 10% over prior year levels to $1.4 billion and represented 47% of our sales for the year.  The largest year-over-year increases were in the areas of industrial automation, instrumentation and energy management, all of which grew by double digits from levels of our fiscal 2010. For the fourth quarter, our sales to industrial customers declined 14% sequentially to about $313 million or 44% of total sales. For this quarter, industrial customers were much more cautious in response to uncertain economic conditions around the world, leading in many cases, to very significant sequential inventory reductions.  The industrial sales decline was very broad-based, spanning all customer tiers, both the small and large customers, all application areas and all geographies. However, throughout the month of October and into November, all the levels from our industrial companies appear to have stabilized. Many of our largest industrial customers, particularly in the USA and Europe, where most of our industrial business is today, have told us that they're still forecasting mid-single digit growth for 2012 barring further deterioration in the macro environment.  We continue to believe that over the long term, the industrial market offers significant growth opportunity in line with ADI's overall corporate growth rate objectives, driven by our customers' needs for increased energy efficiency, industrial automation, higher precision healthcare and diagnostics and advanced instrumentation. In 2011, our automotive revenues grew 25% from the prior year, and at a $415 million annual level has more than doubled in size from our fiscal 2009.  Automotive, which represented 14% of our revenues for the year in 2011, continues to be an area upon which we're focusing investments given the pervasive need of increasing electronic content in cars and our very strong product position in providing technology solutions for this market.  Despite all the economic headwinds, our automotive business was very strong in the fourth quarter. Revenues from our automotive customers were approximately $113 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11% from the third quarter, and an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of last year.  This was yet another quarterly record for automotive revenue, which in Q4 of 2011, represented 16% of our total revenues. In addition to the macro trends driving automotive growth in Q4, we at ADI are benefiting from the pent-up demand stemming from the age of current vehicles on the road, and also, but to a lesser degree, the recovery from the Japanese earthquake. During Q4, safety systems represented a very large part of our automotive business, with particularly strong sales in the areas of airbags and stability control applications.  In addition, demand for our advanced driver systems, systems radar and vision applications also showed solid sequential growth in Q4. These systems are now gaining awareness amongst consumers, and manufacturers are increasingly incorporating them into higher volume, more mainstream vehicles. Car entertainment or infotainment also remained strong in Q4, particularly in the areas of the head units and audio amplifiers during the quarter.  Looking ahead, we believe that automotive will continue to be an important growth driver for ADI, and will continue to benefit from very favorable macro trends within the automotive space, in the areas of active and passive safety, infotainment and also fuel efficiency, all of which should continue to drive much higher dollar content per vehicle for ADI.  Overall, in fiscal 2011, communications infrastructure revenue grew 11% from last year, driven by very strong demand for mobile data. At just under $600 million, communications infrastructure sales comprised approximately 20% of ADI's total sales for the year. In our fourth quarter of 2011, communication infrastructure revenue was $137 million, which was down 9% versus Q3 levels.  Contributing to the fourth quarter sales decrease was the at least, temporary postponement of the China TD-SCDMA rollout, as well as macro driven customer inventory work-downs, stemming from an erosion in operated confidence.  These factors offset a revenue boost that we enjoyed during the quarter related to the Japanese recovery. So in total, sales to communications infrastructure customers represented 19% of ADI's Q4 sales. We expect that the communications infrastructure market will remain a very key area of opportunity for ADI, which is driven by increasing mobile broadband usage, and continued mobile subscriber growth, which is pushing increased infrastructure capital spending, and our analog and mixed signal products are extremely well-positioned with the leading suppliers of infrastructure in virtually every geography of the world.  For the full year, our consumer revenues declined by approximately 6% to $587 million. This year-over-year decline, is primarily the result of our intensifying focus on only higher value-added consumer applications, where our technology is highly differentiated and our position is sustainable over many, many generations of our customers' products. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue was about $153 million, which was up 8% sequentially.  In Q4, the sales to consumer customers represented 21% of our total sales. Most of the quarter-to-quarter increase we enjoyed in the consumer market in Q4 was primarily due to seasonal factors, particularly, in the areas of digital cameras and gaming products. On a regional basis, our revenues declined sequentially in all regions of the world, except for Japan in Q4.  So now, I'd like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter of 2012, which at ADI will be a 14-week long quarter, which happens once every 7 years, I guess. During the fourth quarter that we just finished, order rates continued to slow but appeared to stabilize and our backlog decreased from the prior quarter.  We believe that our customers are continuing to take steps to reduce their inventory levels due to all the uncertainties in the worldwide economy, and we expect this trend to continue through our first quarter of 2012. During our fourth quarter, inventory distribution, as Dave mentioned, declined by 11% sequentially, which is a very, very significant inventory decline for distribution, and was down below what inventories distributors typically stock, which at ADI is approximately 8 weeks.  These inventory reductions at both customers and distributors coupled together with what is typically a seasonally weak quarter for us tends to cause us to expect that revenues will decline sequentially in Q1. Certainly, we'll have the advantage of an extra week in the first quarter, but the shutdowns for Christmas in Europe and North America at the end of December, and the Lunar New Year in Asia, which occurs this year in late January, which will be in our fiscal quarter, will likely mitigate or eliminate any of that benefit.  As such, our plan calls for revenues to be down sequentially in the vicinity of 5% to 10% sequentially. We're also planning to again, reduce production levels in Q1 consistent with the decline in revenues. We anticipate that this should have a negative effect on gross margins, which we're expecting to be approximately 63%, and that's probably plus or minus 50 basis points, depending on where the sales wind up and what the exact mix of our business is.  It's certainly possible that this will be the last quarter of reduced production levels given the low inventory levels of ADI products in all our channels. But that certainly assumes that the macroeconomic environment does not further deteriorate, and really, we have no way of gauging that. We plan to manage our expenses carefully, as we have been for many quarters. An extra week in the first quarter will drive operating expenses up by more than $10 million sequentially.  However, once again, with our variable expense model and some very careful expense management we believe we can hold operating expenses through a range of between $226 million and $229 million in the quarter. Assuming these levels of revenues, gross margin and expenses, we expect our diluted earnings will be in the range of $0.44 to $0.51 in the quarter.  So with all the data and all the factors that are going one way or another, my summary of the takeaways from this call are as follows: first, while in the short term, certainly times is very uncertain, I think by most measures, ADI is weathering the storm pretty well.  Our revenue declines are in line with many of our peers, and less than many others despite the fact that our peak quarter was well ahead of many of our supply challenged competitors. As demand picks up, we believe ADI is very well-positioned to continue to outgrow the semiconductor market as a result of better focus and sustainable mix of businesses aimed at the highest growth segments in the semiconductor market. Secondly, our resilient business model is working well. If Q1 turns out to represent the 12th quarter, as we hope it will, we believe that we will have produced significantly higher margins than in the last downturn despite the precipitous revenue declines that we have suffered.  Last, we're ready for significant leverage when conditions improve. Our inventories will be low internally and out in the channels, which will allow volume ramp-ups in our fabs, which should produce great improvements in gross margins sequentially. We're also committed to continuing very high service levels to our customers by maintaining our lead times at very short levels. As we said many times as we go through these cycles, our long-term success will be very dependent on how we respond to downturns, which routinely are occurring. Given all the current uncertainty, it's certainly very difficult to predict what will happen in the short term.  But as such, we have to respond by staying focused on doing what we do best. We will continue to pursue the opportunities in our strategic markets that offer the highest likelihood for sustainable success, which means they will continue to make -- that we will continue to make the necessary trade-offs, to allocate resources to those businesses that provide the greatest returns. These trade-offs necessitate making very tough choices sometimes, but this strategy protects our most important initiatives and thus preserves and enhances ADI's future.  In addition, we'll continue to vigilantly manage cost throughout the company as we have been doing over the past few years. This strategy produced excellent results for us during our fiscal 2011, a period that we were whipsawed by supply durations and economic turmoil. For the upcoming year, we plan to stay the course, delivering innovative products to customers that gives them a competitive advantage, adhering to the highest standards supply-chain responsiveness, quality and reliability, carefully managing our resources and stay focused on the key strategic programs, and protect profitability to the fullest extent possible given the hand that the market gives us. That's all the prepared remarks that we have. We'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Mindy Kohl [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for questions from our call participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] You have a question from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division The first question is in relation to your initiatives to jumpstart revenue growth, as well as throughout the organization. I was hoping to get an update on where you feel like you've made the most progress, and give us an update in general on what inning of the initiatives you're in? Especially in context of automotive having been the first pet project of yours, and it's showing very strong results. When can we expect some of the other program areas to begin yielding results similar to automotive? Jerald G. Fishman I think what you're referring to is that we put a new organization on the field about 2 years ago. One part of the organization focused on the market segments and the other on the core technologies it will take to drive those market segments. And I think some of the new initiatives that we're funding, and even some of the older things that we're juggling around funding, are basically the result of those 2 groups getting together, and setting the priorities. And also, it gives us a much more flexible structure to move resources around from one area to the other, with people that are very capable of working across different product groups or technology groups of boundaries. And we can make those changes relatively quickly. As we look -- the automotive as you mentioned, I think, is certainly one of those objectives. We've had other objectives in things like radio frequency and some of the micro-machine things we're doing, as well as I would say, expanding even our core businesses and converters and amplifiers and other products into some exciting new markets. So I would say that to a first approximation, that's working pretty well. And the hardest job that we have at Analog is where to put the money. I mean we have incredibly large opportunity for our technology in virtually every market in the world. Some of them are -- move up very quickly and they would go down very quickly, and commoditize, others go up a little slower, but once you get there, you have it forever. So what we're trying to do is aim more of the resources that the markets and the product segments, where the revenues increase and you develop a franchise in those products and markets, and you ride that franchise for many, many years. And I think our resource allocation that we're able to do as a result of this structure enables -- gives us a much, much clearer look at it, and as I said earlier, a much clearer path to move resources to the areas that show the most promise. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Okay. Then my follow-up question is another question on revenue growth. If we are in a later, lower growth phase of the economic cycle, does that influence your acquisition appetite, considering that your domestic cash now stands above $1.1 billion? Jerald G. Fishman Well certainly, that's a factor. We do have a lot of cash, it's not earning very much money. We have a lot of cash overseas, which is earning not so much money. We're not terribly interested in repatriating that cash and paying a usurious tax for the politicians to do it. So certainly, that's one of the factors that goes into our -- thinking about acquisitions. Although we are very disciplined about that. And we have a pretty high hurdle rate for doing acquisitions that are very strategic to Analog. So with the margin, it does change the economics a bit, but I still think we're going to be cautious about that. Operator We have a question from the line of with Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division I'm curious, in the last 2 years, your core converter business has undergrown your overall company sales growth. Conceptually, what is the reason behind that, what can reverse that trend, and how are you thinking about resources and converters versus other areas in an organic and inorganic basis? Jerald G. Fishman Well first our converter business is one of the most, if not the most important, business at ADI. And I think what's confusing a few of those statistics is that a lot of the converter products that we do, we integrate. And as they start getting to where the converter is just a piece of the solution, that goes into the category of other Analogs. And as a result, you'll see the growth of other Analog is very substantial. And a bit -- part of the reason for that is in the converter business. The other part is we have de-emphasized some of the consumer investments, which utilize some converters towards other things. So that has impacted that a little bit. But I think that the primary reason for that, is really the integration of converters with RF products, with linear products and power products, into some very highly integrated Analog solutions. And I think once that level of integration goes on, it sort of goes into a different category. Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And as a follow-up Jerry, just as you look at revenue growth for next year, the handset market is one of the key growth markets, and I understand that in the past, you have de-emphasized, that market is only about 3% or so of sales and it is a very volatile market. But do you think about participating in that market? I know you have indirect exposure to the infrastructure piece, but how about direct exposure to handsets? How about increasing that exposure? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we have products that go into handsets, what we actually strategically de-emphasized was the baseband or the modem, which commoditized at a staggering rate, even for some of our competitors that were much larger than us. So I think the part that we've decided not to do anymore that we sold, was the baseband modem. Now where there are opportunities in the handsets to provide value that really does differentiate the features of the phone, we do invest in that, and we have some good products and they sell into handsets, and those are things we're going to continue to do. One example of that is in the audio business, where some of our audio products make a huge difference in audio fidelity in phones, and where we can do that and we've got a big lead and we think the technology is sustainable, we certainly invest in that. So within that whole category of portable products and smartphones, there is opportunity for ADI. We're just not, we seized and sold all investment in the digital baseband, which I guess turned out to be not such a bad thing to do. Operator We have a question from the line of Chris Danely. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division If you could just run down the 4 main end markets? And maybe talk about how you view inventory in each of those end markets? And also, spend a little bit of time on industrial and common maybe, how they are trending? When you would expect those to start to bottom here and come back? Jerald G. Fishman Chris, there are 2 effects going on I think in virtually every market segment. And one of those effects is, inventory got too high and it got much too high as our customers reduced their expectations for the next couple of quarters. So whatever inventory reductions we had, which we thought were coming to conclusion, didn't really account for the fact that the denominator was going down, as well as numerator. So I think the inventory corrections we're seeing are more pronounced than perhaps we would have thought a while ago. For the -- if you look at -- so that's the inventory part of the equation. What's really going to drive what happens over the next couple of quarters, in a lot of ways, is going to be CapEx. Certainly, the industrial business, capital spending drives our sales. And I think in the communications infrastructure business, CapEx also drives our sales. So if you go out and look at the forecast for that, as we look at those very, very carefully, the forecasts are really all over the map. In some cases, people think that there is going to be growth in the vicinity of 5% to 10% in some of those end markets for next year, and other people think it's going to be negative. And if you just sort of average all those expectations, I think the mainstream prediction is that it's probably going to be about mid-single digits. Now I think if it turns out that, that's what happens in 2012, then I think our communications infrastructure business and industrial businesses should do very well because those businesses tend to grow at a multiple of capital spending. But we really don't know and just as you read all these reports either from the banks or the people that study capital spending very closely, we just don't know when that is going to happen. So we don't know when we'll get a response for that. I think we're getting to be relatively confident that the inventory correction is getting towards being over given the inventory levels we see customers on our distributors. But the real question is going to be what end demand is going to be, and I think we'll just have to wait and see how that turns out. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Got it. And then from a follow-up on OpEx, so with the increased amount of variable costs in the 14-week quarter, after this quarter, does that mean that OpEx should be able to go down on an absolute basis? David A. Zinsner A lot of it obviously depends on what the revenue does in the following quarter. But on a kind of an apples-to-apples basis, considering the fact that we are having quite a bit of pressure in the OpEx from the extra week, we don't envision having that repeat itself obviously, because there'll be 1 less week in the following quarter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division The deferred revenues were down, I think 16% sequentially, and then that's consistent with the distributor inventories declining so much. Dave, I think you said that they were -- disti inventory was below the normal of 8 weeks, but I don't -- I didn't catch whether or not you quantify it further. Can you give us a sense of how far below 8 weeks? Are we talking 7.9 weeks or 7 weeks? Any color there would be helpful. David A. Zinsner It's closer to 7 weeks of inventory. It was just below the 8-week target. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And on that same line, can you give us a sense of your OEM customers? So anything that you're shipping directly, give a sense of whether or not your OEM customers are taking them well below normal as well. David A. Zinsner Not surprisingly, we don't get inventory reports from our OEM customers to give us a sense for what their inventory levels are like. So we can't really answer that with any degree of accuracy. What we do believe though is that inventory is declining at our OEM customers, and that's more qualitative than quantitatively. So our opinion is that inventories are reducing at OEMs. Jerald G. Fishman I mean our sense -- to just give that a little bit more color, is that when we look at our order rates from our largest OEMs, and how much they're down, and we look at what our largest OEMs are telling us about their business levels, our sales to our OEMs is much more negative than they're saying their sales are to their customers. So I think all that's indicative of fairly significant inventory declines with those large OEMs. But as Dave said, the distribution data we get every week, the OEM data we get from our sales guys. Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division So obviously, it's encourage. I was wondering, can you remind us what -- how low they got below normal in the worst of it in 2008? David A. Zinsner In terms of a days perspective? Mark Lipacis - Jefferies &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Yes, in terms of weeks. David A. Zinsner They were -- they had gone in a little bit below 7 weeks, but it was in that kind of range. Operator You're next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crdit Suisse. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division I guess, David, my first question just on the gross margin line. Can you kind of quantify a little bit in the October quarter, and then again, for the guidance in January? What do you think was mix related versus utilization related? And I guess specifically to January, how much lower do you think you guys will take utilization in the quarter? David A. Zinsner In the fourth quarter, about 2/3 of it was mix related, and the other 1/3 was the absorption in the factories. This quarter, it's going to be primarily absorption, we wouldn't expect mix to be a factor. We'll be taking utilization this quarter down to -- I think, it's 63%, 64% that's down from 73% or 74% this quarter. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division And then guys, as my follow-on, Jerry, can you talk a little bit about, on the first fiscal quarter outlook on revenue, how the end markets are trending for the January quarter? And I guess, help me understand as you think about the turn of the business, which end markets do you think will actually be the leaders in that turn? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that of course is very hard to predict. We can't even predict the aggregate very well, forget about the detail. But our sense is, we had a 15 or so percent sequential decline in the industrial business. Now when you think about that, that's a business with tens of thousands of customers. And the whole thing went down 15% sequentially, which -- that's the business where you see changes happening very, very slowly, usually. So I think what happened is, when the large industrial customer base, in particularly, in Europe, the United States started reading the newspapers, they got very concerned and they put the brakes on very quickly. And I think that was aided and abetted by our distributors who tend to react very, very quickly to perturbations. So I think most of what's going to happen is going to be dependent now, that they've taken the inventory down so fast, and what happens with capital spending if CapEx starts to get a little easier. If people get a more confident, I think the industrial business will be one of the first ones that will see the turn up in. If it turns out that everybody listens to CNBC and gets depressed every day, all around the world, and all the CEOs come on there and say, with all this uncertainty, I'm just going to put off what I'm going to do, then I think it will take longer. Certainly what we're expecting in our guidance, is that our first quarter, our consumer revenues will probably be down. I mean that happens even in a good economy in the first quarter after the holiday build-ups. So I mean that's the part that we know pretty much for sure. The rest of it, we just don't know. But the industrial business will probably be the first business that will signal the upturn. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division I'm just trying to interpret the recent order activity, you mentioned orders had stabilized in October and November. Given your leverage to the industrial and communications segment, Jerry, is it typical for you to see orders improve in the year end in preparation for a seasonally stronger first half? Or would you expect things to actually slow down if factories worldwide shutdown for the holidays? Jerald G. Fishman I mean our sense and again, we don't know this any better than you do, is that as you get out towards the end of December, the order rates will slow down in the U.S. and Europe -- and our hope, and that's built into our plan, is what typically happens is in January, we hit a pretty good pickup. So that's -- if the plan comes through this quarter, it will probably be with that type of pattern. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Okay. That's helpful. If your customers are to remain cautiously optimistic about the business, given that inventories are approaching 2008 lows, would it be reasonable to assume then that your business would see a better than normal type of growth in the April period as customers restock? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's certainly logical based on if you're stock and inventories again. But I would -- if you ask me right now, I would settle for a seasonal increase in Q2, given where it is right now. So -- but certainly, what you say is logical, I just don't know if that's the way it will play out. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Morgan Keegan. Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division I wanted to dig into the orders again. It sounded like you guys mentioned stabilization. Should we assume that orders actually went up from -- in the October to November time frame? And then I have a follow-up. Jerald G. Fishman No, I think what we defined as stabilization is they stopped going down. Harsh N. Kumar - Morgan Keegan &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Fair enough. And then Dave, I had a quick clarification for you. Gross margins past the first quarter, if revenue stabilized and you start to sort of build inventory, should we think that the first quarter will mark the bottom for gross margin? All things considered? David A. Zinsner All things considered, I think that's correct. Jerald G. Fishman Don't forget in the gross margins, we're putting now, we normally have lower revenues, but we have a lot less product that we're building to distributors. And even though that doesn't detract from our revenues, it certainly detracts from our factory builders, which is why Dave is making that comment. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research So you had commented a little bit on the converters and other Analog and some other dynamics there. I was wondering if you could comment on what's happening in the digital signal processor part of your business, and where your focus areas are and why that was relative to the rest of your business? Pretty weak in the quarter, as well as year-over-year? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think the DSP business is a business that has both a many customer dimension, which is a lot of different customers buy it, and it has a large customer dimension. Some of the DSP business that we have is heavily consumer-oriented. And I -- certainly anything that's going into the consumer market right now, our overall consumer business year-over-year was down, and the DSP part of that is no exception. So I think there's a part of it that's related to just the overall malaise in the market, and there's another part of it that's very related to some large programs and some large primarily consumer customers. I think as business recovers, that business, particularly in the industrial side of the market, should respond in a very similar way to our Analog business. Because historically, that's what happens. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. And then, the next question is on your own -- actually a 2-part second question. Can you disclose your 13-week backlog? I believe you do disclose that at the end of this fiscal year. And do you expect your inventory, ADI's inventory to be up in fiscal Q1? David A. Zinsner The 13-week backlog as of the end of the year was $379 million. We disclose in the 10-K tomorrow. We're expecting inventory on our balance -- part of it is difficult to tell because, it somewhat depends on what the distributors do with their inventories. But we're thinking that the inventories on -- in an absolute dollar basis, this quarter will be not much be different that they are, than they were at the end of the year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, if you'll see better gross margin on lower revenue this cycle and previously? So could you get to, say, a 67% gross margin on a lower revenue base this quarter, given improvements you may be making also in the organization? David A. Zinsner All things being equal, they are incrementally better than in the previous cycle, because we did reduce some structure -- we made some structural improvements that reduced our cost per unit. However, obviously mix factors into it and whatnot, so that may not be accurate every quarter. But I would say on an absolute basis, prior peak versus our prior cycle versus this cycle, we should be incremental better. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division I mean what revenue level do you think it would take for you guys to, say, 70% or better gross margin? David A. Zinsner Well, we don't have necessarily 70%, so I can't get into that, Steve. Jerald G. Fishman I think roughly, a lot of that depends on the mix of business since the gross margin by industry segment varies quite a bit. So I think that's a better question when we get back to 67, and then, we'll give you an idea what might happen after that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Jerry, you were talking about value-added consumer businesses. Which of the consumer businesses that you're in at the moment offer you the best growth opportunities you think? And are there any emerging consumer segment you're interested in? Jerald G. Fishman Well, a lot of the segments offer a lot of growth potential. The question is whether the products that we want to do, will be highly differentiated enough over a long enough period of time in order to get the benefit of that. Historically, a large part of our consumer businesses have been in products like digital cameras and gaming things, but I think when you look forward, those positions are fine, and we can continue to innovate in those areas. But I think increasingly, you'll see Analog products in more affordable equipment, and potentially, even some broadcast equipment, which are basically, consumer products. So again, what we're really looking for, David, is just products that you get them designed in, and you go through a couple of generations of our customers products, with them still believing that this product is very valuable. And that's what's going to define what products we're in. Operator Your next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division I guess first question, Jerry, you talked about orders stabilizing in November. I guess curious, is that broad-based or particular to one segment? And I guess as part of that question, if you can walk through, relative to the midpoint of the guide, what you see for each of the segments in terms of strengths, weaknesses that would be helpful. Jerald G. Fishman Well, as far as the order stabilizing, as what I said before is that, they were -- they ran down and they stopped running down, which is always a good sign. And so that started happening in October and November when we had no idea if they were going to keep going down, or just stabilized, and they sort of stopped going down, and therefore, businesses running at these levels, I'd say over the last 6 to 8 weeks. In terms of the guidance by segment, we just don't have that level of detail. There are -- the only assumption we have in there is that we expect our consumer business to be down sequentially, because it always is, and that's sort of a guarantee. And the question of what happens between our communications infrastructure business, our industrial business and particularly, some of the soft categories in those very, very hard to predict, all we can do is look at the averages and that's what we've done. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division That's helpful. And then Dave, as my follow up, if I look at your gross deferred revenues, you're running at high 300s. And at a mid kind of 600 revenue run rate. In the past, you've been close to the kind of mid-200, low 200s. So I guess curious, given what you said in terms of the drawdown of inventory at the distis, will that be complete you think, to that kind of low 200 level, exiting January? Or might that still be an issue beyond that? David A. Zinsner Well, on a day basis, distributor inventory is below their target levels. So I guess a lot depends on what the disti business does over the course of the next couple of quarters. If the first quarter turns out to be the bottom, probably the deferred margin goes down a little bit more and then starts to move back up from here, and that's kind of our operating assumption at the moment. But a lot depends obviously on whether we really will see the bottom in the first quarter. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division And if that holds true, is gross margin -- does gross margin start bottoming in January or April? David A. Zinsner If that holds true and inventory starts to grow at distribution, we will certainly -- in all likelihood, be taking our production levels up, that will be beneficial to the gross margin. So we expect the first quarter to be the low point. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Co. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, I just wanted to clarify your comments regarding factory shutdowns. Were you referring just to ADI or factory shutdowns that you're hearing about from your customers? And if the latter, what segments are those coming from? Jerald G. Fishman I'd say both. We're going to shut down a little bit longer than we normally do, certainly in manufacturing and many of the other areas as well. And we just have anecdotal comments from customers in many different market segments about the potential of expanded shutdowns. But we don't get a lot of visibility to the details of that. And what we have is anecdotes from customers, which you probably had better ones than we do. But our assumption is, given all the chaos and given all their obvious desire to reduce inventories, it would not be illogical to them to have extended shutdowns this quarter. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division That sounds reasonable. A follow-up question is on company specific initiative, since there's a lot that's out there that's outside your control, just focus on some things that are inside your control. At analyst day, you talked about pricing initiatives that I took to mean doing a better job of pricing for functional value and I think maybe more recently the company's really focused on its new product introduction to processes, and trying to do a better job hitting commercial windows with that. Can you give us an update on those 2 initiatives and tell us how those are impacting the business as we see it? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think I can give you qualitative answers on that. We've done analyses inside the company in terms of pricing, given that we priced 10,000 products to 100,000 customers, it's sort of hard to be precise on that. But we've seen a pretty good improvement in our margins as a result of pricing actions that we've taken. Particularly, I'd say on the older products that we have, which some of them go on and sell for 10 or 20 years. And customers are very thankful to have a source of supply to that period, and are quite willing to pay a little bit higher prices at the margin to ensure that. Because the price of getting those products out and put another one in it, well in excess of the price that we want. So I think on that dimension, we're doing better. We're also doing better at making sure we don't have a lot of ASP leakage into the system. Through our distributors and through other people that price our products, we're just being a lot -- we have a lot better systems to understand what's going on, and what you inspect you should expect to get better, and we're inspecting all that stuff pretty carefully. We do monitor very carefully our Average Selling Prices by product area, by geography, by customer. We have tremendously credible information systems in the company on every dimension that we're capable of understanding and actioning, where we see perturbations that don't seem right to us. So I'd say we can always do more, and I think we will do more in the future, but we've made some pretty good progress to date, which is helping our gross margins. And I think it's one of the reasons that Dave indicated a lot of enthusiasm about the gross margins in the future. On the new product stuff, that's also -- that we introduced between 200 and 400 new products a year. And I think the best vehicle to get our growth up on those questions is to make sure that they're the right products. So portfolio prioritization and adjustments that we've been making and that we will continue to make are one of the best vehicles to make sure that we actually put products in the market that are going to sell. Of course, we have tremendously more pressure on the system to get the products out on time. And one of the ways to that other than beating everybody up, which we do I guess as well as anybody, is to make sure that the product we're trying to get out are properly resourced. And that means that the ones we're serious about, we add resource to, and the ones we're not serious about, we take resources out. So overall I think that's really helped the most, and it's really going to demonstrate itself in future years, because what we bring out this year not only helps 2011 and 2012, but it really helps the out years. So the sooner you get it out, the sooner you get the design ins, The sooner you get the design ins, the sooner revenue comes. And many of these products have very long revenue tails on them. So again, these are not things that have instantaneous uplift in the short-term, but I think over time, on the new product side, it's going to impact our growth rates. And on the product side, it's going to impact both our growth rates and our margins. So I think more is better, but I think we're doing okay. Operator Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just a question on the OpEx side of things, how should I think about the extra week versus the shutdowns? Are they pretty much offsetting one another or is one larger than the other? David A. Zinsner Unfortunately, no one lets us not pay them for the week -- so we actually incur the expense regardless on the salaries and such. Where we do save a bit of money is just we obviously aren't turning the lights on with a little less activity in the -- just like line by consulting and travel and those things. So we save a little bit of money there, but we do incur the expense associated with the employees. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Jerry, one in the competitive landscape, during downturns like this in the past, we've seen competitors take various strategies. Some wanting to run their fabs, some getting aggressive on price to keep the fabs full, et cetera. Have you seen any strange activity in the competitive landscape during this downturn? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think our company will keep doing the same thing in every cycle. So the ones in the commodity businesses, where price is the only determinant you see, you just see a lot of people going out there, dropping prices. That's not where most of our products are. In fact, when we look at our Average Selling Prices, which given the dynamic range of prices that we have from one product to another, they're remarkably stable, so we're not seeing almost any real change. We see a change in mix, and that changes things a little bit. But the mix adjusted, average selling price stays the same. In the last cycle, we saw different competitors doing different things. We've decided that we should reduce our production levels to get the best, we have plenty of inventory, we can turn them up very quickly, we're not laying off a bunch of people, so we'll have trained people ready so that when business picks up, we have trained people that are capable of building the products. There's very different competitive responses out there. Some companies just lay a whole bunch of people off. Some people just build inventory to keep their fabs running so they don't have margin deterioration. Our sense after many, many years of experience, and sometimes, being -- doing the right things, and sometimes doing the wrong things. Is that the best strategy for ADI is to keep most of the people, and keep the inventory levels down and have a supply chain that's flexible where our customers can count on. And that's, at least over the last cycle or 2, what we've done, worked out well for us, particularly relative to some of our more notable competitors, and I think that's what we're going to do again. Operator Your next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division This is Mark Delaney, calling in for Jim Covello. I was hoping you could talk a little more about the comm infrastructure business? First if you have any visibility on when the Chinese build-out might continue? And then second, what kind of impacts do you think the LTE build-out might have for you guys in 2012? Vincent T. Roche Let we try and address the TD-SCDMA thing first. While, there has been obviously a delay in during 2011, but the expectation at least from what we're hearing in China from our customers is that somewhere in the first half of 2012 we can expect a significant build on the TDS site, but I should point out as well, TD-SCDMA is actually a pretty small part of our communications infrastructure business overall. But we depend obviously, on the more pervasive standards like 3G and LTE for our revenue streams. But on TDS side anyway, we expect something to happen in the first half of 2012. Operator Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I have -- first one on OpEx. So I know you have this trade-off between the extra week and everything else, but I mean basically, if I normalize your spend for 14 weeks this quarter versus the 13 weeks last quarter, I come up with about $12 million in OpEx on a normalized basis which is just coming out. So can you give me some feeling for how much of that is just a simple reduction in variable comp, given the reduction year-over-year growth in operating profit, versus other -- I guess other initiatives that you're taking? Give me some feeling for how much of those cuts, and even the cuts that you saw this quarter might be temporary versus permanent? I'm trying to get some feeling for how we ought to be looking at the OpEx roll forward -- going forward in the quarters? David A. Zinsner Well, to make sure I'm understanding it properly. So our expense was $225 million, it was down roughly $6 million from last quarter. There was no extra week this quarter or nor was there an extra week last quarter. So this was a straight apples-to-apples change. It was all predominantly related to a reduction in the variable compensation. And then, we did a few things on the austerity program side to bring the expense in a little bit more. And then on the offsetting side, we did have a couple million dollars restructuring in the quarter. Next quarter, our guidance is for it to be up slightly to maybe $4 million or so. We'll probably, as you say, get at least $10 million, maybe even close to your number, $12 million, of additional expense associated with the extra week, however we are... Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division And then, that would save. So if I divide Q4 by 13, and if I divide Q1 by 14, and then I just look at the weekly OpEx, you're taking it down about $1 million or close to $1 million a week on a normalized basis? David A. Zinsner Yes, now some of that is the variable compensation coming down, and then some of that, quite honestly, is just -- we're going to be under some pressure internally to keep the discretionary spend to an absolute minimum. And then, one of the things we're doing internally is shutting the facilities down for a couple of weeks across most of the locations. And so the hope is that our activity spend will be down a little bit as well, and so that should help keep the expenses contained. Does that make sense, Stacy? Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Yes, so is it more like happening -- comps versus the other thing, because I'd expect the variable comp to go with the operating metric, with some of the others ought to come back -- I would think in revenue. David A. Zinsner So variable comp is probably down a couple of million dollars, quarter-over-quarter. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division And for my follow up, just something very broad. I guess the maximum and minimum range of your revenue guidance, can you give me some feeling for what sort of -- from what would have to happen to reach the top end of your guidance and what would have to happen to reach the bottom? What do you have baked in on both extremes? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think -- so a great deal of it will be determined by just the macro stuff. Our sense is that the inventories are going to continue to go down, and that's going to be result in some additional decline. But I think when the history is written, it will be mostly -- particularly, as we get into January, about what actually customers' consumption of our products is. And -- I mean that's the way these cycles go. First, demand is ahead of consumption, then it's behind consumption, then it equals consumption. And our hope is that once you get out to January or so, demand and consumption start to look alike. And if that happens, that should be a positive. But we just don't know. Mindy Kohl We have time for just one more question, because we've gone over our allotted time. Operator We have one last question from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Dave, can I just ask you to conceptualize the utilization rates this quarter, if it went back to periods of -- if we excluded 2008 and 2009, which was probably an extraordinary period than possibly 01, 02? How does this compare with previous inventory corrections? Is this kind of where it bottoms normally? David A. Zinsner We've been down to 50% in terms of utilization, so it's clearly a lower number. Now, to be fair, we have more capacity at the time we were down to 50%, so we have taken out some of that capacity. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Yes, that's what I was hoping to kind of help understand. So if -- how much capacity do you think is being taken out just so that we can say, okay, this is kind of way bottomed on the inventory correction and kind of try and get a number to this. David A. Zinsner I don't have that number in front of me. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay I'll follow up off-line. Jerry, you were describing what was going on with TD-SCDMA, you had talked about a temporary pause and resumption in the first half of 2012. So 2 questions here. One is, how much more expense do you think we'll need before we could say all the phases required is done in TD. And I know it's a small part of your portfolio. And then looking into 2012, your financial comm infrastructure, how comfortable in terms of the compositions you have with your customers, how do you think the demand should play out in 2012 for the other parts of the comm infrastructure business? That's my last question. Vincent T. Roche Well, on the TDS side, there's still -- I believe, several phases planned. But to give you a specific number, I'm not in a position to do that. But we take this one year at this time. As you know, in China, we have many standards playing against each other. 2G, 3G, and 4G coming online as well. So all those standards are going to play into the mix. And ultimately, it will be really consumers who decide which standards get to play long-term. With regard to demand overall, I believe our customers are looking at risk again, 2012. Some of the larger customers out there have done very, very well during 2011. I expect those customers will do well again in 2012, in developed markets, where there's a massive ongoing demand for mobile data, driven by the need to be able to move video wirelessly across the network. And I think certainly in Europe and America and Japan, that need is going to continue on a basis and will drive what we believe to be very, very good demand. Both in the wireless sector, and as you know, we play in the radio front ends there. There's no dampening on the requirement for innovation in that area. And also, as we move more and more high bundle data through the wireless network, it creates a need to be able to move the data in packet form through the fixed networks, as well as, such as optical and cable. So our customers are bullish and we're bullish. And certainly on the wireless side, we're expecting growth over the long-term in the double-digit area in the communications infrastructure areas. Mindy Kohl Okay, that concludes our Q&amp;A session. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again during our first quarter 2012 earnings call. Thank you.

McAdam - Executive Vice President of The Strategic Market Segments Group Thomas Wessel - Vice President of Worldwide Sales   Analog Devices Inc.  Annual Meeting of Shareholders March 13, 2013 9:00 AM ETMargaret K. Seif Good morning, everyone. It is 9:00 and we're ready to begin our Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Analog Devices. My name is Margaret Seif, I'd like to welcome everyone here today joining us at our corporate headquarters and also those of you listening via the web. Please note that rules of conduct and procedure apply to this meeting and are available in the voting area over there if you wish to inspect them. Our agenda today will begin with prepared remarks from our Chairman, Ray Stata. We'll then proceed to the formal meeting, and we will conclude with remarks by our CEO, Jerry Fishman. So without further delay, I'd like to introduce ADI Co-Founder and Chairman of the Board, Ray Stata. Ray Stata Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you, Marnie, for the introduction. And I'd like to add my welcome to those who come to our 2013 Annual Stockholders Meeting. I'll begin by introducing the corporate officers who are with us today. First, Vincent Roche, the President of Analog Devices. Vincent, I think -- particularly take -- make note of the fact that I'm sure all of you seen that Vincent was promoted to President this past year, and he's taken a lot of new responsibilities, and along with him, a number of others in the senior management ranks, who are promoted to share the load, and Jerry is going to talk a bit about -- more about that in his remarks. Also here is David Zinsner, our Vice President of Finance and Chief Technical Officer; Sam Fuller, Vice President of Research and Development and our Chief Technical Officer; Bill Matson, Vice President of Human Resources; Robbie McAdam, Executive Vice President of our Strategic Business Segments Group; and Dick Meaney, Vice President of our Products and Technology Group; and Marnie Seif, Vice President, General Manager and Secretary -- General Counsel, I should say; Thomas Wessel, Vice President of Sales; and Robert Yung, Vice President of Corporate Development and Chief Strategic Officer; and finally, Jerry Fishman, our CEO. I'd also like to just introduce the Board of Directors who are with us today: Jim Champy; John Hodgson -- Jim, John Hodgson; Yves-Andre Istel; Neil Novich; Grant Saviers; Paul Severino; Ken Sicchitano. And I'd also like to extend a special welcome to Lisa Su, who joined us last year as our newest director. Lisa has a distinguished record of leadership both in the managerial and the technical arena and a long career at both Freescale, IBM, and more recently, at AMD where she is the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Global Business Units. So Lisa joined us in June of 2012 and is serving on our -- as a member of our nominating and governance committee, and we're pleased that she's sitting for election here today. Next, I'd like to introduce to you our independent auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, and we're asking our shareholders today to ratify the selection of Ernst &amp; Young as our auditors for 2013, and representing EY here today is Michael Terrell [ph]. And finally, I'd like to introduce Mark Borden, a long friend of Analog Devices, our General Counsel from Wilmer Hale. So before we begin the formal part of our meeting today, I wanted to mention just a few of the highlights for 2012. First, in April of last year, Analog's stock began trading on the NASDAQ, which I think is now recognized throughout the world as the leading exchange for innovative high-technology companies. In December of last year, Analog Devices was added to the NASDAQ 100, which is an index of the largest NASDAQ companies rated by their market cap. Our market cap today stands at about $14 billion. If you happened to be in New York -- in Time Square last week, you may have seen our logo, up on the iconic NASDAQ tower. Here's what you would have seen. [Presentation] Ray Stata So we -- Dave tried very hard to get them to play that on New Year's Eve, but somehow he failed. So the other thing I'd point out is that in 2012, Analog was named a top 100 innovator by Thomson Reuters. This is the second time that Analog has been so recognized, and that's quite a distinguished recognition because it's done on the basis of rather thorough examination of what qualifies for that amongst many, many thousands of firms. In 2012, we were also published -- we also published our sustainable report, the third one we reported, which chronicles Analog's leadership in environmental health and safety stewardship. We achieved the highest score amongst all the Analog semiconductor companies for the quality of our disclosures and for our performance on the actions taken to mitigate air, water and climate impact. So Analog's score rose to 76 in 2012, up from 49 the year before. We were also honored as one of America's greenest companies, again, for the third consecutive year by BusinessWeek. And moreover, Forbes Magazine reported that Analog Devices was named to the top 25 list of socially responsible dividend paying stocks. So all in all in many ways, 2012 was a very successful year for Analog Devices, for our employees, our customers, our stockholders, for everyone, and I'd like to just congratulate the team and all of our employees for the outstanding job that they did once again in maintaining our leadership in the high-performance, surreal world signal processing industry. Thank you. Margaret K. Seif Okay. So we'll now have the formal part of the meeting, where we take the votes on the matters described in our proxy statement. Once all of the votes are taken, we will adjourn the meeting, and afterwards, our CEO, Jerry Fishman will make a presentation and answer any appropriate questions you may have. As indicated in the notice of meeting and proxy statement that we mailed to our shareholders, we're here today to consider and vote on the following business items: The election of our directors; the compensation of our named executive officers; the approval of our executive section 162 Plan; and the ratification of Ernst &amp; Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2013. We will consider each item in turn today. The polls for each matter being voted on at this meeting will open when the matter is called to a vote, and will remain open until I announce that the polls are closed. No ballots or proxies or revocations or changes will be accepted after the polls are closed and we will announce the results of the voting on each proposal immediately following the tabulation of voting. I received an affidavit from Broadridge Financial Solutions, certifying that the notice of Annual Meeting and proxy statement were sent to all shareholders of record as of January 11, 2013. This affidavit is available for inspection by any shareholder in the voting area. Are there any shareholders present here today who wish to vote in person? If so, raise your hands. If you want to, there are ballots over here. I've been informed by Broadridge that there are present at this meeting in person or by proxy, a majority of the outstanding and issued shares of common stock entitled to vote on each of the proposals described in the notice of meeting. So a quorum exists with respect to each proposal. The first matter for our shareholders to vote on is the election of 10 directors for a term of 1 year to expire at the 2014 Annual Meeting. The nominees for election are: Ray Stata, Jerald Fishman, James Champy, John Hodgson, Yves-Andre Istel, Neil Novich, Grant Saviers, Paul Severino, Ken Sicchitano, and Lisa Su. So any discussion on this motion before we vote? Okay, we'll now vote. The next matter for the shareholders to vote on is a nonbinding say on pay vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers described in our proxy statement. Is there any discussion on this motion before we vote today? So we will now proceed to a vote. The next matter for the shareholders to vote on is approval of our executive 162 Plan as described in our proxy statement. Is there any discussion on this motion today before we vote? Okay, we'll now vote. And the final matter for our shareholders to vote on is the ratification of the selection of Ernst &amp; Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year ending November 2, 2013. Is there any discussion on this motion before we vote today? We will now vote. This concludes the business items on the agenda for this Annual Meeting. If you have not yet voted and would like to do so, you may proceed to the voting area now. Hearing nothing, I will ask, have the ballots been collected? Unknown Attendee Yes. Margaret K. Seif The polls are now closed. And we will have a report of the preliminary results of today's voting. Unknown Attendee On the motion to elect the 10 nominees as directors of Analog Devices, each of the nominees has received a majority of the votes cast in favor of their election. On the motion to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, a majority of the total number of votes cast has been voted in favor of this proposal. On the motion to approve our executive section 162 Plan, a majority of the total number of votes cast has been voted in favor of this proposal. And finally, on the motion to ratify the selection of Ernst &amp; Young as our independent registered public accounting firm, a majority of the votes -- a majority of the total number of votes cast has been voted in favor of this proposal. Margaret K. Seif Thank you. As a result of the voting, each of the nominees has been elected a director. The compensation of our named executive officers has been approved. Our Analog Devices executive section 162 Plan has been approved and Ernst &amp; Young has been ratified as our independent auditor for 2013. Following certification of today's voting, the final results on each proposal will be filed with the SEC, and will be posted on our website at www.analog.com within 4 business days. There being no further business to come before the meeting, I'm going to adjourn the formal part of the meeting. But before I turn this meeting over to Jerry Fishman, please note, here comes the sexy part, the various remarks that may be made about future expectations, plans, projections and prospects for ADI constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Jerry will deliver his remarks, and then answer any appropriate questions you may have. [Presentation] Jerald G. Fishman Well, good morning. For those old timers that have come to the meeting for many years, this used to take us about 10 days of preparation and 160 slides to explain so this is a lot better. So it shows how far the technology has really come. One thing I'd like to add my good morning to the welcome that Ray provided earlier this morning to our Annual Shareholders Meeting. I think as you can see from the brief video clip, the impact of ADI's technology on so many different applications is really profound. We're helping our customers develop advancements in electronics that are making this world we all live in safer, faster, greener, smarter and better in so many ways. It turns out it's a very, very exciting time to be in Analog Devices, and the opportunities for the kinds of products and the kind of technology that we have at Analog is really in many ways endless. We're, of course -- we're not immune-ed from the external environment that we all have to live in, and in our 2012, the economy was in tough shape. It was very uncertain and it was difficult in most regions in the world and that certainly impacted the whole semiconductor industry and we're naturally part of that. But even with all those headwinds in 2012, we did manage to capture the opportunities that were in front of us and we gained even more focus on our business on the things that we really want to do and that we're very good at doing. Our success, really, is driven by 3 very, very simple differentiators. First, we have a very focused strategy, and we don't divert from it. We have a very clear sense of purpose of what makes Analog unique in the eyes of our customers. And I think we're also blessed with a very strong and experienced leadership of some of the most creative and talented and innovative people in the entire analog industry. Our strategy at Analog in simple terms is to focus on markets, customers and applications that have the potential, the real potential, to grow at a faster rate than the overall semiconductor market. In these areas, we target most of our resources to solve the most difficult signal processing challenges by providing game-changing technology and world-class service and reliability and quality to our large group of customers. In what has turned out to be over the last 10 or 15 years an incredibly volatile industry, our strategy allows us to consistently generate very strong profitability and very strong cash flow in good years and also in bad years. With the very robust margins we earned, we're able to maintain very high levels of R&amp;D investment to feed the cycle of innovation in Analog that has lasted now for almost 45 years, and allows us to continue to provide our customers with the breakthroughs that they need to continue their market leadership. Importantly, our returns that we get also allow us to continue to enhance the returns that we're able to provide to our shareholders. The strength of our business strategy was clearly evident in 2002 -- in 2012 rather, which was a year in which massive reductions in capital spending in the industrial market and the communications infrastructure market really did limit the opportunities available for companies like Analog Devices. For those who've been with Analog many years, I think you might remember that capital spending in both either communications or industrial products is really the main driver of our business. It has been that for many years and it continues to be that. So when industrial or capital spending -- industrial capital spending goes down, our business tends to go down. And when infrastructure and industrial capital spending go up, we react very quickly to that, and I think this cycle will prove that to be the case again. But yet, despite all the pressures that we had in 2012 and all the uncertainty that we experienced through the year, we did manage to generate $2.7 billion in revenues. We did manage to generate 64.5% gross margins, and our operating margins were about just over 30% for the year, which I think most companies would be very proud of no matter what the economics were in the world. Importantly, also, we generated very strong cash flow in 2012. We generated over $815 million with 30% of sales and operating cash flow, and free cash flow was just under $700 million with almost 25% of sales, which are very strong statistics, again, by virtually any measure. The cash generation capability in Analog has provided the opportunity to consistently improve our shareholder returns. In 2012, we repurchased approximately $160 million of our common stock. This brings our cumulative repurchases since we began our share repurchase program back in 2004, about 8 or 9 years ago, to a cumulative total of $4.4 billion, which represents just under 130 million shares of our stock that we bought back. In 2012, we also increased our quarterly dividend by 20% over the previous year, and we paid out $345 million in dividends to our shareholders. Since the first dividend was paid around 2004, I believe was the first year we paid the dividend, almost 10 years ago, Analog has increased our dividend 10x and has paid out $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. So in total, between share repurchases and dividends, we've returned over $6 billion to our shareholders since this program began. As a result of the performance that we've had, also, what we see is increasing confidence amongst most of our large shareholders and our long-term prospects. Our total shareholder return last year, which is the sum of stock price appreciation plus dividends was approximately 10% for the year, and that certainly is at the high-end of what any of our peers produced last year. In addition, since 2007, as you can see on the chart, we've outperformed the cumulative shareholder return of the S&amp;P 500 Index and also the S&amp;P Semiconductor Index. So it just really shows that if you do the right things and get the right returns, you get rewarded by your shareholders. I think this chart is very stark evidence of that. But certainly, without a very clear sense of purpose, these results simply would not be achievable. For ADI, our mission has remained the same for many, many years, and that is to be the world's best and most innovative signal processing company. Yet, how we achieve this mission continues to evolve over time according to the changing market dynamics and the changing needs of many of our largest customers. A foundational and very critical element of what we do has always been, and I think will always continue to be, the development of game changing core technology. We focus on technology innovations and converters and linear products and radio frequency products and micro-machine products and power products and DSP. And those products create competitive advantage and maintain our reputation for outstanding service and quality and reliability as well. Together, these technologies and the products on those technologies have strengthened our position as the very best brand with our broad base of tens of thousands of customers around the world that buy our products. We then leverage those technologies into more market-driven integrated solutions that our largest customers need to innovate, of course, a very diverse set of applications, many of which you saw on the video, such as smart energy grids, smart phones, advanced automotive safety, fuel efficiency systems, high bandwidth communications, nonintrusive medical diagnostics and patient monitoring applications and robotics and industrial controls in most of the factories of the future. While the path to our missions continue to change, our internal environment remains mostly the same as it's been for many years. ADI remains a place where the most talented technologist come together to explore new ideas, to learn from the best in class that work for Analog Devices, and ultimately, many of them choose to build their entire career at Analog Devices, and we hope that continues into the future. That's certainly what has made us successful for over 45 years and has allowed us to develop a portfolio and an institutional knowledge base in our business that today remains simply unmatched by any other competitor. This very deep and experienced team we have at Analog has also provided us with a very strong bench to develop the next generation leaders for Analog Devices. And in 2012, as Ray mentioned in some of his earlier comments, we promoted a number of long-term ADI executives to take on increased responsibility in our new organization. First and certainly most importantly, Vince Roche, who has been with Analog for 24 years, he's a youngster at Analog, was promoted to be the President of Analog Devices. Vince and I have worked together for many, many years, for a couple of decades, and I have always found him to be an enormously talented executive, who knows our business exceptionally well, in his insights in both the technologies that we develop and the markets that we serve and also he's built relationships with the largest customers around the world in virtually every location. Vince used to run our sales organization. He also ran our market segment organization so he had ample chance to really understand what's going on with most of our customers. And now, in his new role, apply that understanding to the markets we serve and the products that we develop. Also, in 2012, we promoted another short-term Analoger, Robbie McAdam, how many years is that Robbie? Robert P. McAdam 29. Jerald G. Fishman 29. To lead our market segment strategies, which I alluded to a little earlier, which is the way we take our core technology and pick the places where customers want more integrated and more whole solutions to their products, and Robbie's institutional experience and the knowledge he has of our customers and our products, and the markets is really truly unique, and we're fortunate to have somebody of that capability to do that job. Also, Ray mentioned, Dick Meany, who's now heading up all our product development at ADI, which is one challenging job. One of the hallmarks at Analog for many years has always been it was very -- we had that responsibility diffused through the organization, and we had at onetime 73 product lines, all of which were making their own decisions, and if they ever converged with a customer, it was because God was looking at us favorably. And now, with the pace of technology development that's going on and the urgency to get the right products to the right customers at the right time, this is an enormous responsibility and I've always had a great deal of respect for Dick in terms of his ability to manage R&amp;D in the company. And Dick asked for this job and he got it. So whatever complaints you have, Dick, it's not my fault. So I think Dick will really make a huge difference of being able to move technology from one area to another to get the true benefit of the scale of Analog's R&amp;D investments and capability in many, many businesses around Analog. I think that's going to be a big improvement for us. And also, we promoted Thomas Wessel to be Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Thomas came to us many years ago from our friends down in Dallas, Texas Instruments, and we've always had a great deal of respect for Texas Instruments' sales force, and Thomas, I'm not going to say anything more than that, and -- we are webcasting this, I guess, right? So I'll shut my mouth, and the -- I think Thomas brings a unique perspective of the real value of ADI's technology to our customers. Thomas, in his last job at Analog was very instrumental in building our automotive business up to now being nearly a $500 million business for us, and one of the fastest-growing business at Analog. So again, Thomas, he's a relative newcomer. How many years, Thomas? Thomas Wessel 10 years. Jerald G. Fishman 10 years. God, 10 years. And if he gets rid of that car and stops driving on the autobahn at a 110 miles an hour, I think he has a great future here. So I'm really convinced when you look at the people we have in place and the people that we're promoting. I'm convinced that we have both the skills and the organizational determination to take ADI to the next level over the next 5 to 10 years. As I said a few minutes ago, it's a very exciting time to be part of Analog Devices, whether you're an employee, whether you're a customer or whether you're a shareholder. Just recently, as part of our Analog -- our annual planning process, we began to take an even longer-term view of the strategic opportunities that are available for ADI. We've now extended the time dimension that we look at out to 5 and 7 and 10 years, and we realized as we did that, the tremendous wealth of opportunities for our technology that is available to Analog Devices in the next decade. As a result, I think we began 2013 with a lot of confidence that despite our great history and despite all the turmoil in the world still today, that Analog's best years are still ahead of us. So in closing, I'd like to thank everybody who's listening, all our employees around the world for coming into work every day, believing they can do what nobody else can do year after year, and that really helps us and invigorates us all to achieve the mission that we've set out for the company. And also, our loyal shareholders who have been with us through thick and thin through good years and bad, we have a great base of shareholders that are mostly long-term holders that believe in what we do and believe, and really find that what we do is credible and have stayed with us and continued to be large investors for Analog for many, many years. And I know over the years, that's been a straining exercise for some investors. So that's all I have to say this morning. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

My name is Natalie and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I will like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Miss Tagliaferro, you may begin your conference. Maria Tagliaferro Okay. Thank you, Natalie, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Maria Tagliaferro, Director of Corporate Communications for ADI. Here with me now are Jerry Fishman, our President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; and Vincent Roche, Vice President of Sales and Strategic Market segment. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you haven't yet seen our first quarter fiscal year 2012 release or the release announcing an increase in the dividend, you can find both on our IR website at investor.analog.com. A recording of this conference call will also be available on the website within about 2 hours of the call's conclusion. I would like to point out that there were 14 weeks of activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, that compares to a typical 13 weeks in a quarter. From time to time during today's conference call, we will point out the impact of this additional week on historical and projected trends.  The 14-week quarter occurs because ADI follows a fiscal year calendar of 52 weeks per year. As a result, there is an extra week approximately every fifth or sixth year, and to adjust for that one day difference between our fiscal year and the typical 365-day calendar year. Finally, I'd ask you to please note that the information that we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liabilities established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q which was filed today.  The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is February 22, 2012. With that, I'll turn the call over to opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald G. Fishman Well good afternoon to everybody. As you can tell from our press release, our revenues in the first quarter totaled about $648 million, which was a decline of 9.5% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. And although within the range we provided last quarter, it was at the lower end of that guidance range.  Continuing inventory reduction by both our customers and distributors in November and December, coupled with lower capital spending by many of our customers, reduced orders on ADI and that continued the trend that began about 6 or 9 months ago. Nevertheless and happily, order rates and orders began accelerating in January and have continued strong into February, which leads us to believe that our first quarter may represent the sales gross margin and operating margin trough of this cycle for ADI. And we expect to resume growth in our second quarter, which began in early February.  We believe that customer and distributor inventories are reaching levels commensurate with the now revised outlooks and many of our larger customers have become marginally more optimistic and are beginning to free up some of their capital budgets. I'll provide a few more specifics on the short-term outlook towards the end of the call. In the first quarter, our sales, into virtually every end market except automotive, declined sequentially and year-over-year. In the first quarter, automotive sales actually increased 6% sequentially and 26% year-over-year as ADI continued to benefit from increased ADI dollar content per vehicle and increased vehicle unit sales worldwide. We would expect that our automotive sales to remain strong in our second quarter.  Industrial revenues declined 8% sequentially in Q1 for the third consecutive quarter of declines. The decline was very broad-based across customer tiers and geographies and of course industrial automation, energy instrumentation and health care applications. As has been the case now for several quarters, order rates from industrial customers appear to be well below consumption rates for our products for the first 2 months of our first quarter, but have recently been showing some good signs of improvement, which of course is very welcome news for us, since the industrial market represented 45% of our revenues in Q1 and remains our highest margin business. Based on these trends, we expect that industrial revenues will increase in the second quarter after now 3 quarters of sequential decline. The communications infrastructure end market also declined in the first quarter. Continued economic uncertainty, some country-specific regulatory issues and disruption from the failed AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger all contributed to widespread deferral of orders for new systems in favor of temporary improvements, mostly software and network capacity. Communications was 19% of revenues and declined 13% sequentially. While at this point in time, we're not currently forecasting much improvement in communications infrastructure revenues in our second quarter, our customers in many geographies are now beginning to signal that we should expect the resumption of growth in the second half of this year. The consumer end market decreased 21% sequentially, a little bit more than our seasonal expectations, but also due in part to customer production limitations caused by the floods in Thailand, which limited our customers ordering patterns for many of our products. We're currently forecasting some growth in consumer sales in the second quarter, in line with what we normally see seasonally from first to second quarter.  So I think, really, the summary comment with few exceptions is the 2 things that seem to play out during the first quarter were inventory reductions at most of our customers and delays to long-term capital expenditures at many of our customers. And I think for the most part, we now believe that both of these trends seemed to have run their course, at least for ADI, by the end of December. On a regional basis, only North America experienced any sequential revenue increase in Q1. And even in North America, the growth rate was very modest. It was only up about 1% or so. And that was the result of strength in automotive and the wired communications markets in the U.S.  Revenue in Japan declined by 23% due to consumer inventory seasonality and also the supply-chain limitations that I mentioned earlier.  Revenues from Europe decreased 12% as increases on automotive sales were more than offset by declines in industrial and communications revenues.  Revenues in China decreased 11%, as declines across the industrial end market overshadowed good growth in other markets.  This RoW, or rest of world, decline of 6% was largely due to reductions in consumer revenue.  So now Dave will take you through some of the details of the first quarter financial results, and I'll come back after Dave's comments and talk a little bit more about the outlook. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, first quarter revenue declined 9.5% sequentially and 11% year-over-year to $648 million. Our gross margin was 63.2% in the first quarter. This was down from the 64.3% we reported in Q4, primarily as a result of our decision to decrease factory utilization.  Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in control with virtually 100% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 6 weeks and in 99% within 4 weeks. Operating expenses for the first quarter were approximately flat from the prior quarter at $226.1 million, a great result given an extra week of expenses. Holiday shutdowns and tight control of discretionary items helped keep expenses in check.  Operating profits for the fourth quarter were $183 million or 28.3% of sales compared to 32.9% of sales in the prior quarter. Operating profits were down both in dollar and percentage terms as a result of the lower revenue and reduced factory absorption in the first quarter. Other expense was $3 million in the first quarter compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense.  Our tax rate for the first quarter was 22.6%, in line with expectations we communicated for our 22% rate in fiscal 2012. We expect our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, to be approximately 21.5% for the remainder of fiscal 2012.  Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 in the first quarter was slightly lower than the midpoint of our guidance, as tight control of operating expenses provided some relief against lower revenue on gross margins. Cash flow in the first quarter continued to be strong. We generated 33% of our revenue or $215 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $25 million, resulting in free cash flow of $190 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter.  Our accounts receivable balance decreased from the prior quarter by $46 million due to lower sales, and our days sales outstanding increased by 2 days from the prior quarter to 46 days.  Inventory was carefully managed and increased by only $2 million or less than 1% despite lower sales. Inventory at distribution also declined by approximately 7% and is at the lowest point since 2010. During the first quarter, we repurchased $78 million of our stock, and we received $49 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. We also distributed $74 million in dividends to our stockholders. Our cash balance at the end of the first quarter was approximately $3.7 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion is available domestically. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $870 million in debt outstanding.  On February 21, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, up from $0.25 last quarter, which will be paid on March 28, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 9. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of about 3%. This significant dividend increase represents our strategy to improve returns to our shareholders and also our confidence in our continuing ability to generate significant free cash flow in the future. In summary, our operating model includes significant variable costs that have helped ADI achieve record-high margins during the upturns in recent industry cycles, and equally as important, during the inevitable downturns. Our results in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of our model as tight expense control, variable compensation and a highly responsive manufacturing infrastructure have ADI well positioned for the emerging recovery.  At current operating margin levels, we have significant operating leverage as sales increase, and we begin to reload our factories, while keeping very tight control of operating expenses. And so now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry to discuss recovery in terms of ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Well, thanks, Dave. Although we are certainly in a challenging business environment, we do see improvement on the horizon. We now believe that our inventory levels at both OEM customers and distributors are below consumption rates, and we're pleased to report that our order rates have improved and increased significantly over the last 6 weeks.  For the second quarter of 2012, we believe revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $675 million or up 1% to 4% sequentially. Considering now we're going from a 14-week quarter to a more normal 13-week quarter in Q2, this sequential revenue growth at these levels is significantly higher on an apples-to-apples basis. We're planning for higher sales and a higher mix of industrial products, which leads us to our gross margin plan of somewhere between 64% and 64.5% for the second quarter.  While utilization will increase in Q2 compared to Q1, it's expected to still remain below 70%, which indicates that we still have significant remaining gross margin leverage as sales improve in future quarters and as utilization expands.  We anticipate that operating expenses will remain flat in Q2 to Q1 levels and also to Q4 2011 levels at about $226 million. Given that the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, as Dave mentioned, we will continue to aggressively monitor and control our expenses in Q2 and for the balance of the year.  Based on these estimates that are excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.53 in our second quarter. So in summary, the fundamentals of our business remained strong during this cycle. And as growth returns, we believe our customer relationships, our technology portfolio, our better market focus, our terrific service levels and our financial model will all contribute to higher profitability and we believe, increasing shareholder returns. Maria Tagliaferro Great. Thank you very much, Jerry. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of James Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I guess first question, Jerry, can you give us some sort of idea of how much you think we can grow revenues here just from customers kind of going back to consuming at their own shipment levels? So in other words, if production and consumption levels kind of come back in line, how much can we grow? And then beyond that we're going to need sales growth, how much do you think, just kind of catching back up, can you give us some growth here? Jerald G. Fishman Well that's a very complicated question to answer, so I can only really speak qualitatively about that. One way to think about it, I think, Jim, is that if you look at our industrial revenues from the peak of where they were before the cycle sort of collapsed to where last quarter wound up, our industrial revenues are down 20-plus percent. If you look at our customers' results in the industrial business, none of our customers' results are down anything like that. In fact, many of our larger industrial customers particularly -- well, customers in the United States and Europe and China, we look and their industrial revenues are up. So there's been a pretty significant inventory reduction at our customers. When you couple that with their most recent outlooks -- and after I finish, I'll turn it over to Vince who just came back from another long week on the road talking to a lot of those customers, I think most of our customers are really not pessimistic about the next couple of quarters. I'd say they are not jumping off the tables and saying that everything is great, but they're -- so they expect to get some growth and some little sooner, some a little later. I think the early adapters in this business to what's happened will be the industrial business, but I think soon after, it could be followed by the communications business. So it's really very hard to put a crisp number on it, but some of the largest customers have had enormous inventory reductions, well beyond what would be indicated by any potential slowdown on their sales. So I think there's a reasonable amount of just snapback, just to get back to normal consumption levels. But Vince, you have some comment? Vincent T. Roche Yes. Just a couple of points for color here. I think it's true to say that the first -- or let's say, the second and third quarters of the year just gone -- customers were trying to get ahead of the supply issues and a lot of over-inventorying was done. I think the second half of the year was very much dominated by the debt crisis in Europe to a large extent, a lot of our business is done in Europe with the industrial customer base, particularly in the areas of automation. I think the confidence is generally good with our customers out there that this is going to be a pretty good year, maybe modest growth. But I think also some customers still believe that their burning off inventory, and it will take probably another couple of months to get the inventory out of the pipe. But I think certainly second and third quarters, we're expecting to see some positive movements in terms of industrial customers based on their confidence and certainly the order rates that we're seeing from them. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division That's terrific. If I'm allowed a follow-up I guess I would ask how much margin expansion should we see for every, say, $50 million of incremental revenue growth from here, assuming mix stays the same with industrial being a little bit higher of a percentage than it was at times in the past? David A. Zinsner This is gross margins you're asking? James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Correct. David A. Zinsner Well I know, I mean we're obviously -- first off, I think the gross margin, if this is indeed the trough, we're pretty stellar relative to previous troughs. In fact, I think, now our previous troughs -- our previous peaks are like much our current troughs. So we've done a lot to fundamentally improve the gross margins from where we were, say, a few years ago. Going forward, clearly I think the utilization were down to -- a lot of this is going to be driven off utilization -- were down below 70% when we were at our peak at 67%, a little over 67%. We were -- our utilization was up past 80%. So really the fundamental driver in getting the margins up, I think, will mostly be a function of getting that utilization up. And as Jerry said, we're still even next quarter operating at relatively low utilization, and I think our expectation is that we'll ramp back into the levels that we saw in prior periods where the margins were up into the high 60s. Jerald G. Fishman Jim, the other comment I'd make is that we're working hard to really manage the inventory very carefully here. And we want to make sure that we have enough so -- because in these kind of cycles, you can get a very quick snapback or changing customer sentiment, and everybody starts loading you up again. So you got to be careful that you don't see both ends of the seesaw here. So we're trying to keep the inventory levels at reasonable levels, so that: number one, we'll get expansion on the gross margins when we really do load the factories, but also that when customers do decide to make changes, and history shows they make those changes very quickly that we can be as responsive in this cycle as we were in the last cycle. We still think that's the best policy for ADI. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Just a little bit, maybe more on the gross margin question. So Dave, could you quantify what your utilizations were in the January quarter? And is the full utilization rate for you guys north of 80%? And did you have any one-time kind of markdowns or inventory effects impacting gross margins for your last quarter? David A. Zinsner Okay. So utilization in the first quarter was 67%. Like Jerry said, we're expecting it to be north of that, but below 70%. So hard to pick the exact point, but somewhere between 67% and 70%, we're expecting utilization. We did have a little bit of a inventory write-down more so than we normally have in the first quarter. It probably was -- contributed about 50 basis points of the decline in gross margins, certainly will help us because we don't think that's going to repeat again in the second quarter. As far as maximum utilization goes, I guess, theoretically, if you get to a 100, rarely do you get to that level, so something in the high 80s probably, or 90% is probably where we'd like to -- where we feel comfortable and think we can keep our lead times to the place we want to keep them. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, we've operated our manufacturing facilities very well at 90% utilization. And then just by adding small amounts of incremental capital, we can get the overall capacity up quite quickly. So 90% is quite comfortable for us. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay, great. And then on the inventory question, it sounds like some areas from your perspective, if I heard it correctly, are getting lean, in some areas, there are still some or what your customers are communicating to you as they're digesting inventory. What are the areas that still seem like they're still in the process of burning down inventory? Vincent T. Roche I think particularly in the small customer base, which is largely industrial and some of the larger industrial customers themselves, but I think it's very much industrial and possibly health care as well. Jerald G. Fishman But all the signals we're getting is, that's really winding down. So we're seeing -- when the inflection point on the bookings occurs broadly as we've seen, that's usually an indication that there's still might be a little inventory out there in couple of the customers, some of these end markets as Vince mentioned. But that's going to not affect the results nearly to the extent that it has affected them over the last 3 quarters. So I think we're all -- even if they are still burning off a little inventory, the net results that we can achieve is quite a bit better than where they were, where the mentality 6 to 9 months ago was just get inventory down as fast as you possibly can. We had many of our largest customers that went through a quarter or 2 and didn't order anything because they just didn't want any more inventory. And that really accelerated what we got into November and part of December when they were facing year end. We monitor our customers' inventory in aggregate pretty carefully. And when you look at the inventory levels of some of our large industrial customers are carrying in aggregate, this doesn't necessarily make a comment about ADI products specifically. It's quite, quite lean right now. So there might be some more to go. It might take another month or 2 in some of the accounts, but I believe and what we're seeing in the order rates is most of that is behind us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of from Tristan Gerra from Robert Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Could you talk about the segments this year you think are for the best growth opportunities? And also on a geographic basis, do you expect to catch up in Japan over the next couple of quarters as the supply chain comes back? Jerald G. Fishman I didn't get the first part of your question, could you repeat that? Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division The first part of the question was just to talk about some of the segments that you think are for the best growth opportunities for ADI this year? Any color by end market? Jerald G. Fishman Sure, I think was that the question... Vincent T. Roche Sure. I think in general, yes. So your question is the best growth opportunities across the globe. So clearly automotive has been a standard growth contributor to the company over the last couple of years, and I expect that will continue this year and for the next few years at least anyways. Demand is very strong in all the geographic markets. And particularly the America, we saw strong growth in the quarter just gone. In fact, I read a statistic in the last couple of days that the average age of a car now in America is over 10 years, so there's a replenishment cycle going on there very, very clearly. And we're expecting in Japan and China as well growth in the region of 9% to 12% for this year. There's, again -- in China, there's a lot of demand for mid- to high-end cars that we're very prevalent in supplying products to. And Japan as well there's a very, very strong replacement activity going on there. So I think automotive will be strong. Communications infrastructure, I believe, in the second half of the year as we start to see the calendar year, as we start to see the continued data explosion and the need to put hardware in places. As Jerry said earlier, there's been kind of an optimization cycle in the past quarter or 2, but the operators who have the cash are going to have to start putting hardware into place over the next 2, 3 quarters. So I think we'll see some decent growth there. And industrial, as I said, it could be modest but at least we expect some growth during the remainder of this year. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Okay. And then a quick one could you give us the breakdown of your communication revenues? Vincent T. Roche Well it's roughly -- 2/3 of the revenue comes from the wireless infrastructure sector and 1/3 from the wired infrastructure sector. And wired is really the composite of optical and cable infrastructure and some enterprise business. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Crdit Suisse. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division Yes. Quickly, Jerry, the first question I have is just relative to the January quarter. You guys came in at a little bit late of the low end of guidance. Was that all the Thailand? And the reason why I ask is a lot of chip companies actually saw some strength in the December, beginning of January. So I'm just kind of curious as to why you guys came in at the low end of your guidance for the January quarter. And then I have a follow-up. Jerald G. Fishman Well I mean, it's hard to say what other people did one way or the other. We weren't even around the last 2 weeks in December. We had most of our factories closed and not much of our sales guys out there. But we began to see the increase in very early January, starting with the first week in January that we came back, and we've seen that to be relatively strong since then. So it's very hard for us to say why somebody's orders were stronger one week versus another. It's hard to get into that level of granularity. I'm just happy to see that our orders began to pick up in early January and it has continued strong into mid-February. That's the best I can tell you. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division A follow-up, just going back to the utilization, below 70% for both the Jan and the April quarter, can you do -- can you help us, remind -- for every 100 basis point improvement in utilization, what that might mean for gross margin? And I guess given the strong mix of industrial in the April quarter, does mix come into a play that perhaps dampen cyclical leverage beyond April? David A. Zinsner Well clearly the second quarter will have a strong industrial component to it. And that will help gross margins from a mix perspective. But we think or we're assuming that industrial was at a low point in the first quarter and that we will see recovery beyond the second quarter. So my guess is mix is not a headwind going forward, if we're right that we're in the early stages of a recovery. But I guess maybe the best way to describe the utilization to gross margin ratio is, back when we were operating in the 67% gross margins, we were running kind of high 70s to 80% utilization. Jerald G. Fishman It's not a strictly linear relationship of x number basis points for each point of utilization. It just -- does not the way the factories are run, that's not the way the costs are generated. But I think Dave's comment is illustrative of the kind of gross margin leverage that's out there as utilization improves. But we can't model it linearly for you. Operator Next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division The first question is just a follow-up on the communications business. Vincent, can you talk about the types of projects that you're hearing about for the back half of the year? Are those 3G projects? Or are those LTE projects? And the color that you're getting, can you provide some insight on whether that's based on OEMs in particular geographies, or on the projects in particular geographies? Or is it more broad-based? Vincent T. Roche Well I think all of the major players in the wireless space are attacking the market with a broad range of technologies. Some are more heavily focused on 4G, some of them got out of the starting blocks earlier on the 4G, but I think everybody has some level of offering across 4G, 3G and even 2G. In India today, we still see deployment of 2G. But my sense is that this year or next year, we're going to see largely a move out of 2G into 3G, and I think most of our sales over the next 3 or 4 years will be dominated by 3G and particularly 4G. I think it's true to say that in the more developed economies, the deployment is really 4G at this point in time. It's to get the data into place that people need to be able to move all these massive quantities of mobile video and high-bandwidth data. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And then switching gears and a question for Dave. Dave, real nice increase on the dividend, 12%, $0.30 a share. As we think about the dividend generative capacity of the firm and the balance that you want to strike as you think about the right level of payout and the cash that's available in the U.S. to fund that dividend, how do we think about an upper control in that forward, what the dividend payout might be as we think about ADI's business? David A. Zinsner How do we think about what? Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division The upper control limit. Is there a free cash flow payout that you wouldn't want to go over? Or what are some of the parameters that you're looking, as you think about what the potential payout is on your dividend? David A. Zinsner Well I mean the issue with using payout ratios on cash flow is every quarter it can be up and down, depending if you have onetime tax payment, things like that. So generally historically I think -- someone mentioned that we've been paying -- we've paid out around 40% of our net income in the form of dividends, and what we'd like to see is that number to be higher. We don't have a rule of thumb for every quarter, but we're trying to push the dividend to be more and more compelling to shareholders, return more and more of our cash flow to shareholders. And that's really the way we think about it versus some sort of scientific ratio that we apply. We think that investors, at least the ones we've talked to particularly over the last, say, 6 months has been really interested in dividends as a means of returning cash to shareholders vis--vis buyback. So we've taken the approach to really put a little bit more emphasis on the dividend. Operator Next question comes from the line of Uche Orji from UBS. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Jerry, can I just ask you a few subsegment questions? So my first question is on the infrastructure area. You did mention some of the events last year that led to a slowdown in basically the wireless infrastructure. As you go in through this year and you talk to your customers, what is the expectation for recovery there, particularly in North America and in China. Is there any comment on wireless infrastructure will be helpful. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Because of the situation in the U.S., there would be the whole situation surrounding AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, there was obviously a great lull in procurement of equipment or deployment of equipment and procurement of products. But in my sense is some point in this -- in the next number of months, we're going to see, as I mentioned earlier, some level of deployment of hardware because there just aren't enough base stations deployed, particularly in America and Europe to have -- handle the data requirements that are in place. Now our -- the operators and our customers have been trying to optimize the equipment that's already there through pretty much software techniques, just to get the capacity to where it needed to be. But I think we're going to see a pretty strong deployment of new hardware, particularly in Europe and the America in the area of 4G in the second, third, fourth quarter of this year. But I think in Europe and America, we're pretty much 4G; Japan, 4G; and in China to be a mixture of 2, 3 and 4G. Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division In terms of the leverage you have as we go into -- as we deploy 4G, I know that some of that component suppliers will have higher leverage. Do you think as we go into 4G -- there are 2 questions here, one is how much more leverage do you think you have within that segment? And also in terms of the base of that over 3G, I mean I'm just trying to see if there's any way to understand how ADI could leverage this growth beyond just about that in the 4G deployment. I'm not sure if that's any more incremental leverage for you. Vincent T. Roche SO I think it's actually very good for ADI. The more complex the problem becomes, and the problem does become more complex in terms of delivering performance when you get to 4G levels. That's good for ADI. We participate in pushing the performance envelope in all of these radio systems across the globe with all the major players. So the move into 4G is very, very good for ADI. And of course it won't stop there either. There will be more generations coming on top of that in the years ahead. So in terms of being able to put a specific quantity in there in terms of leverage, all I can tell you is that the content increases for ADI in terms of ASP per system, the higher level of the system, and that is certainly true in terms of 4G from 3G, for example. Jerald G. Fishman Well I think the other part of it is that not only does that require higher performance components, as Vince said, but we have a much wider spectrum of products that we supply in newer systems. We've talked previously about our RF portfolio, which I think in the early generations of wireless infrastructure was quite minimal, but in the more recent and most advanced deployments, our RF products are very, very important, and very often the differentiator in the system that differentiates our product offerings from our competitors. We also have many other new products like clocks and other types of things that go around converters that we never had, really, in the early 2, and in some cases, 3G deployments. So I think that we're getting the benefit of number one, that you need higher performance components; number two, in many of the new systems, there are more cards per box than in the older systems; and thirdly, the product offering is much broader in the newer systems than it was in the older systems. So the combination of all those 3 things happening simultaneously does give us a lot of leverage on the upside as newer systems get deployed. Vincent T. Roche There are 2 dimensions to the products that we supply to these systems. We have, of course, the data path products that allow the performance, the speed and the bandwidth performance requirements to be realized. But also there are control and observation circuits that are required that become more and more sophisticated as the standards continue to increase in performance levels. So it's good on both sides of that -- on both those dimensions for ADI, both in terms of the data stream, but also the sophistication of the components required to keep these systems stable and secure. Jerald G. Fishman I would just make one final comment on that. That when we visit all the large infrastructure accounts, we are one of very, very few competitors that can offer the breadth of products they really want. And as you look forward, the deepness of the relationship that's going to be required between the suppliers, in this case, like ADI and the manufacturers, who well-known in this business is getting to be much, much tighter every year. And the strategic rationale of buying one part from one vendor and another part from another vendor and picking the rest of the catalog in that business, I think is more indicative of what it's been than what it's going to be in the future. So I think that the deepness in the strategic engagements that are required to really penetrate new applications in that business is much, much greater than it's been. And in that sense, the breadth of the portfolio, the reputation of the vendor, the share that the current vendor has, the build of materials, the technology roadmaps in terms of not only single products but very integrated products that integrate analog technology and RF technology and a bunch of other things on either the same chip or the same package is going to be a very important differentiator going forward. And In that sense, we think that's one of ADI's long-term, very significant competitive advantages. Operator The next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays Capital. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division I guess first question, I was hoping to maybe get some color on whether you saw any changes in order patterns post-Chinese New Year, whether any business performed better or worse. Would love to hear color on that. Jerald G. Fishman I don't think so. I think what we typically see is business was very good for quite a while. The Chinese New Year came and businesses in Asia weakened for a week, and then it came back very strongly the week after. So I don't think we saw any trends in the Chinese New Year that are not very typical to what we have seen normally. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess as my follow-up, I was hoping maybe could talk a little bit about some of the recent acquisitions, Lyric, AudioAsics, et cetera. Any contribution there that's noteworthy that we should be thinking about in terms of future growth? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think some of the -- the second one you mentioned has been long ago integrated and cataloged as an important part of our product offering. Lyric is much more of a longer-term play where we really believe that the kind of technology they have really enables performance that without that type of technology, it just isn't possible on many, many dimensions that are very critical in signal processing. We're just now beginning to embed that type of technology in our products. We have a couple of areas that we picked out where we think it's the most relevant. So I think as we get out toward the end this year and into 2013, we will begin to see Lyric technology deployed in a wide number of ADI products that will really -- that technology will really make a huge difference in power [ph] participation and other characteristic signs that people really care about. So the proof is in the pudding, and it's always hard to predict exact quantitative numbers long in advance. But everything we've seen so far substantiates the value of that technology ultimately to Analog Devices and our customers. Operator The next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie Jerry, you mentioned that you'd expect a quick snapback on the industrial side. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the piece of how that would look. I mean is it you get the bulk of that recovery in one quarter? Or will it take at least over a couple of quarters? Jerald G. Fishman I think it will be probably, if history is a good example, it will be a gradual recovery, eventually it gets to the point where people's psyche changes a little bit and they start saying, \"Oh my God, there's not enough supply out there.\" Then we can see more rapid acceleration. But at least from the data that we're getting from the customers and Vince, as I mentioned, just visited a bunch of our large industrial customers in the last week or 2. I think what we're expecting or at least what we're planning for is a gradual recovery in our industrial businesses as we've seen in many other cycles. Vince, do you have anything else to... Vincent T. Roche I think just to add a little more color to what Jerry said, we have -- we characterize the industrial sector across the areas that have automation, energy instrumentation and aero. And we've seen since this time last year, pretty much all those subsegments are down just about the same level from the peak. The indications are that they're all going to pick up. As Jerry said, they are down roughly about 25% over the past year. Now we're expecting that the recovery will be fairly gradual, and I would say in the next 2 or 3 quarters we'll see the recovery gather steam. Jerald G. Fishman Of course Vince is just saying that because he wants me to raise his sales plan. Our experience is that is typically what happens. Jonathan Smigie Right. And my follow-up, with regard to the telecom recovery you're talking about for the second half, is there a particular geography you'd expect to see a sharper or more meaningful recovery? Jerald G. Fishman I don't know. I mean my own sense, I'd be curious to hear Vince's views on that. It will come up where it went down the most first because some of that recovery is just going to be the end of the inventory reduction. I think longer term, everyone can make their own prediction about which economies are going to grow faster, what's going to happen in Europe, what's going to happen in the U.S. as the election gets closer, what's going to happen in China in terms of government policy. So there's a lot of unknowns about what the macro issues are going to be in each of the regions. But I think right now, what we expect is that the places that have done -- have had the most significant reductions will have the most significant increases at least in the short term. Vince? Vincent T. Roche Yes. So the industrial business that we've talked about a lot is very intertwined in Europe and America, in particular. Those 2 regions have seen the sharpest declines over the last few quarters, and they are the regions that I would expect to see improve, see the benefit of the improvement over the next number of quarters most compared to the others. Jerald G. Fishman I think just to try to quantify that just a little bit. If you go back to the fourth quarter, our peak quarter, in industrial revenues, which was about a year or 15 months ago, we were doing -- we did $350 million in the industrial area that quarter. Last quarter, we did below $290 million. In a business with probably 10,000 or more different customers in virtually every geography in the world, that's a massive decline in the short period of time. I mean that's a market that tends to move at glacial speeds. So that just gives you a sense of what it is that is possible for us over the next couple of quarters. But we'll just have to wait and see how that happens. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I had just a quick one first on, I guess, the effect of the 14th week. So as I recall from last quarter, you'd suggested that holiday shutdowns and I guess the Asia holidays as well would mitigate or eliminate any potential upside from that 14th week, but you don't seem to be suggesting that now when you're giving color on the seasonal growth embedded in your guidance. Can you give us some feeling for how much additional revenue in this quarter that you just reported that 14th week actually provided, so we can get some better feeling for what the apples-to-apples seasonal growth comparison ought to be? Jerald G. Fishman I mean it's purely a guess is what I'd have to say. We believed that probably we lost at least a week to maybe 1.5 weeks of revenue last quarter due to the holidays. Some people think it's 2. Some people think it's this. I mean there are a lot of different analyses of that. Of course it's very hard to be specific about that. But I'd say if you took a number of 1.5 week or something, that probably wouldn't be a bad number. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division But wouldn't you usually have that same loss of revenue in this quarter every single year? So that would be normal wouldn't it? Jerald G. Fishman Oh no. Yes, partially that's absolutely true. But when you have a year where the economy is really in the tank and virtually every company that we sold to, including us, it was closed for at least a week and maybe, in Analog's case, 2 weeks, and many of our customers. That tends to be exacerbated from what would normally be people think 3 extra days over Christmas off. So I think when times are good, we see periods where we get through that with almost no change in the Christmas period. And when times are bad, we get a whopping big change. So I think this was more in the latter category than the former. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Okay. And for my follow-up, I want to touch a little bit on this, I guess, peak-to-trough decline in industrial revenue. So there, you're right they're down 20-plus percent from the peak. But is it fair to say that, that peak itself was potentially elevated as the customers were probably overbuilding inventories? Do you have any sort of feeling for how elevated it might have been and like -- how far below are you? What would tend to be sort of a normalized level of typical inventories? What would that decline be if it was off of a normalized level? Jerald G. Fishman You're asking very challenging questions that we really don't have... Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I do try. Jerald G. Fishman I know you do, and you can see. I mean it's very hard because when we were shipping at those levels and we went to the customers and went to our sales folks, and said, \"Boy, this looks pretty overheated. Is this really sustainable? And what's going to happen when the inventories rebalance?\" And we got a lot of comments that was very specific with the consumer, customers and I'd say the communications customers that this one probably took 10 million too much, this one took 20 million too much. And we did see a long lineup in the lobby of those kind of customers that were desperate for products then. We didn't see that much in the industrial area, because the customers tend to be smaller and more diversified. So in the communications area, it's a little easier to try and be quantitative about that than in the industrial area, but I don't know. If you say I did 350, how much could that be? It could be $10 million, it could be $20 million, I don't know. It could be $5 million. I don't think it's more than $20 million. But I don't know. I just don't know. When there's too many customers, too many different ordering patterns to be real specific about it. Vincent T. Roche Yes. I think a couple of things that might have helped us through the upswing, through the cycle. I think our lead times were very healthy as the tsunami crisis hit last year, and we've kept our lead times very healthy as a company over the last 2.5 years. And also, we paid very close attention to the demand rates as per the end customer rather than factoring in the channel demand. So I think those 2 things helped us to some extent manage both the upswing and the downswing. Jerald G. Fishman I think the other thing that we look at, Stacy, a little bit to try to smooth this out as we look at what the growth rate of the industrial business has been over the last couple of years on the average, because this owing supply or demand issues on either side of that end. The kind of numbers that we're planning for our industrial business are commensurate with the industrial business that's grown about 8% to 10% a year. Now I think '11 was a little bit overheated. The year before was a little bit underheated. But the sequential numbers are harder to try to predict because of all the things you're saying that what's the long-term growth rate of that business, and I think with the success we're having in some segments of the industrial business, which are growing at quite strong rates. We think long term that's a good grower for us. And it's going to grow at a rate that is higher than most people believed and that we even believed when we looked at it 3 years ago on the average. Years will be better; years will be worse, but the question you're getting out of trying to predict, how much industrial revenues you're going to get based on the bounce back is just -- we just don't know enough to be quantitative about that. I mean there's something there, I just can't pin point exactly what it is. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just a quick clarification. If we take out the 14, the 13-week transition, did you guys feel like demand or your revenue this quarter is back to normal seasonality? Jerald G. Fishman I don't know. I don't know what normal is in this world any more frankly, but I think what we're -- the guidance that -- the range of guidance that we put out is indicative of the order rates that we're now achieving. That's the best I can say. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division That's fair. And then in terms of the increase, Jerry, do you think that it's all inventory replenishment or all demand improving or a little bit of both? Jerald G. Fishman Well your guess on that is probably as good, if not better, than mine. I think there's certainly some inventory replenishment. As Vince said earlier, many of the large industrial customers are indicating that they're planning to grow this year. And so I think there's probably some of that in there. It's probably a combination of those 2, the ratio between those 2, I just don't know. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Okay. And then one last clarification, if I may. On the reported quarter, the reason you guys came in at the low end of guidance, was that because consumer and/or industrial was a little bit lower than you thought? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think November and December were worse than we thought at the outset. And then we were worried going into January that we'd miss the lower end of the guidance. I think we had some people around that believed that was the case going into the Christmas period. But January was a better month, and you could really see the inflection point in the order as soon as we came back. So that was very encouraging. And the fact that it stayed strong in the early part or the first couple of weeks in February, which we've now seen is encouraging to us and we're hopeful that continues. Maria Tagliaferro Great. Well we just came up on the 6:00 hour, and unfortunately we have quite a few people still in the queue. So I'm going to ask folks to give us a call to the Investor Relations line.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Okay, Ali. You can take a deep breath. Ali Husain I just want you to have more time is all, Jerry. Jerald G. Fishman Okay, good. Glad to hear. Well, hi and good afternoon to everybody who's joining the call. As you know from the press release, our revenues for Q1 were about $622 million, which was down about 10% from the previous quarter and also down about 4% from the same period last year, which you might remember, the first quarter last year was a 14-week quarter. The diluted earnings per share, which exclude a few special items, was $0.44, which was at approximately the midpoint of our guidance that we provided last quarter. Overall, the order and sales patterns were very challenging during the first 2 months of our Q1, as our customers continued to reduce their inventories and industrial and infrastructure capital spending remained very muted going into the end of the calendar year. In January, order rates began to improve and remained strong so far this quarter. Our belief is that the current order strength is the result of our customers becoming more confident about their prospects as 2013 unfolds and also the end of inventory de-stocking. This has certainly been a pretty tough cycle, particularly in the industrial market where we believe that customers ordering has been well below consumption now for several quarters. Based on historically low customer inventory levels and feedback we get from our largest customers and also our largest distributors, we expect that Q1 will likely be the trough quarter for ADI in this cycle. Over the past few quarters when demand weakened, we very carefully managed our business, keeping production levels low and our inventory under very tight control. Inventory dollars actually went down in Q1, although days increased as a result of the sales decline. We also managed operating costs very tightly, and we moved strategic resources to the most important programs. And finally, by design, our variable compensation costs were lower as business conditions weakened. So this all, in combination, produced very respectable margins and very strong cash flow during a very challenging quarter and has also set up significant upside operating leverage as business conditions improve. Our very strong cash flow and balance sheet support an increase to our dividend, and this afternoon, we announced that our Board of Directors voted to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.34, which is up 13% from last quarter. This increase reflects our strategy to continuously enhance our shareholders' returns via increasing dividends and is enabled by ADI's very strong and consistent cash generation capability. Since the first dividend was paid in December of 2003 almost 10 years ago, we have paid the cash dividend to shareholders each and every quarter, and we've grown the dividend consistently over that period. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Vince for some more details and insights into the trends in the end markets, and I'll come back after Vince and Dave finish their comments to make some comments about what we see going forward. So Vince? Vincent T. Roche Well, thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everybody. Well, as we expected coming into the quarter, sales were mostly down sequentially across all our major end markets. So I'll talk about some of the specifics and provide some insight into what we see going on in each of the major markets. Firstly, industrial sector revenues, which make up about half of our total, declined 8% sequentially in Q1. The decline was broad-based across customer tiers, geographies and channels and across automation, energy, instrumentation and defense aerospace applications. As has been the case now for several quarters, order rates from industrial customers appear to be well below consumption rates. Customer inventory reductions, coupled with constrained CapEx, dampened order rates from these customers for much of Q1. But since early January, order rates have been improving, which leads us to expect the industrial end market will be the strongest grower in the second quarter. Now we've spoken many times about the importance of the industrial segment to ADI, and we continue to see an excellent match for the full suite of ADI's high-performance signal processing technologies. There are many macro level opportunities in such areas as power grid management, machine automation and precision instrumentation, which drive the deployment of more and more sensor and actuator systems, which in turn will drive the need for high-performance signal processing. We've been steering increasing levels of R&amp;D to the segment over the past few years to strengthen our core capabilities in converters, linear and DSPs, and to extend our capabilities in areas such as RF and MEMS in order to capture the opportunity available to us. This strengthening technology platform, along with ADI's strong reputation for technology, supply chain and quality amongst the tens of thousands of customers we serve, leads us to believe that our industrial growth can be pushed well above the average in the future. So let me turn to the communications infrastructure segment. Now in this area, sales declined 12% in the first quarter after 3 successive quarters sequential revenue increases. The decline was broad-based, with the largest sequential decrease coming from the wireless infrastructure subsegment. The CapEx environment worldwide was muted, and customers rebalanced their inventories in Q1 as they headed into the calendar year-end. Our expectation is for modest growth from the infrastructure sector in 2Q, with meaningful tailwinds to the business as we progress into the second half of the calendar year. Now accelerating the deployment of 4G LTE and TD-LTE wireless systems globally and the introduction of heterogeneous networks combining macro and small cells offer solid growth opportunities for ADI. Our customers are dealing with significant challenges in the areas of efficient and flexible spectrum utilization, power reduction, system cost and deployment efficiency. Because the radio architecture sets the performance envelope for the system, customers need the advanced radio transceiver technologies in which ADI specializes. In the past 3 years, we've increased R&amp;D to broaden our core technology reach in order to exceed our customers' needs and position ADI to deliver the most competitive radio transceiver solutions on the market. Now in addition, we've sharpened our focus in the wireline sector to focus on control applications and selective data path with advanced converter, linear and timing power solutions for the leaders in cable, Ethernet and optical infrastructure. We remain very bullish about ADI's growth prospects in the infrastructure segment, given the growth in equipment installation footprint, the fact that we continue to deepen our engagements with the market leaders and the increasing content available to ADI as we extend our available market from generation to generation. Let me focus on automotive now for just a few minutes. Revenue there declined marginally in the first quarter, down 3% sequentially, representing 17% of sales compared to 16% in the prior quarter. During the first 2 months of the quarter, we experienced inventory reductions at our customers. In January and into February, we have seen indications of an improved demand environment. So in the second quarter, we should see modest growth in automotive. Over the last few years, automotive has been a consistently strong growth sector for ADI, almost doubling in revenue from 2007 levels. With the push-pull effect of government mandates and an insatiable appetite from OEMs for high-performance signal processing, our long-term expectations remain high in automotive. Car manufacturers continue to electrify and automate the automobile. Predictive, preventive and protective safety systems, precise powertrain control systems and high-quality multimedia systems require proliferation of sensors and actuators, which in turn place ever-increasing demands in signal processing technology. So we believe this is an excellent match for ADI signal processing. Also, while we continue to have a strong presence in the U.S. and European manufacturers, we've made significant progress in executing our plan to penetrate the Asian market over the past few years. The combination of a growing served available market, strong technology match and deepening customer engagement leads us to believe that the automotive end market will continue to be a strong growth story for ADI. And finally, the consumer business declined 22% sequentially in what was an expected seasonal decline for that business in Q1 after a very strong performance in the fourth quarter. In total, consumer was 17% of sales, which is a more typical consumer mix for ADI compared to 20% in the prior quarter. We expect this segment will be approximately flat in the second quarter. Now as we've mentioned before, we have been refocusing R&amp;D on those parts of the consumer market where we can make a demonstrable and sustainable difference to the user experience, particularly in audio and imaging applications. In order to mitigate the inherent sector volatility, we endeavor to invest in a given application only when we are convinced that we can play over several generations in a leadership position and make adequate returns. Many such subsectors exist in the consumer market, and we will carefully exploit these opportunities with the market leaders in the years ahead. So at this point, I'll hand over to Dave, who will take us through the details of the financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jerry had mentioned earlier, first quarter revenue declined 10% sequentially to $622 million. Revenues declined 4% compared to the first quarter of 2012, which, as Jerry mentioned, was a 14-week quarter. Our gross margin was 62.7% in the first quarter. This was down from 63.8% that we reported in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower factory utilization. Utilization decreased from the high 60s in the prior quarter to the mid 50s in the first quarter, which dropped inventory on our balance sheet by $6.5 million. Inventory and distribution was down in dollars in the first quarter but in terms of days was up about 1 week to 8 weeks based on lower sales. We believe inventory in this channel is increasing, in line with improved end customer order rates through the distributors. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. We recorded a $40 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, and if you'd like further details, you can find more information in the Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today. Excluding this charge, operating expenses were $222.7 million, which was down $5 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to tight control over discretionary items and also due to our variable compensation model, which modulates with business performance. Operating profits before tax for the first quarter, excluding this restructuring charge, was $168 million or 26.9% of sales, down approximately 400 basis points from the prior quarter. Other expense of $3 million in the first quarter was flat to the fourth quarter and reflect the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 17%, excluding an adjustment of our annual tax rate for the reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit. We're expecting our tax rate to be approximately 17% for the remainder of FY '13. Diluted earnings per share of $0.44, excluding special items, was at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow in the first quarter continued to be strong. We generated 25% of our revenue or $158 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $18 million, resulting in free cash flow of $140 million or 22.5% of revenue for the quarter. Our cash and short-term investments balance increased about $87 million during the first quarter and now stands at approximately $4 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion available domestically. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $760 million in debt outstanding. Net cash on a per outstanding share basis was slightly above $10. Our accounts receivable balance was down about $10 million versus the last quarter on lower overall shipments in the quarter. And our day sales outstanding increased to 48 days from 45 days in the prior quarter, which is typical in a recovering business environment. During the first quarter, we distributed approximately $91 million or 69% of GAAP net income in dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, up from $0.30 last quarter, which will be paid on March 12, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of about 3% and represents a 13% dividend increase. While we repurchased a relatively small amount of stock this quarter, we continue to view repurchases as an important vehicle to improve shareholder return, and we'll continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock, with about $560 million remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program. Our results in the first quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of results to invest for the future while responsibly dealing with the realities of an uncertain market. Our actions during this cycle have built in significant operating leverage as we continue to focus our investments on profitable, diverse and sustainable markets and begin to increase production levels as orders increase while keeping tight control of our operating expenses. We have a very responsive manufacturing organization capable of responding quickly to the changing demand patterns. So now I'll turn the call over to Jerry for some closing comments and to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Well, thanks, Dave. As I mentioned earlier, our sense is that Q1 will turn out to be the trough quarter for ADI in this cycle, and we expect revenue growth in Q2. We expect our most significant revenue growth during second quarter will be from industrial customers where higher order rates, inventory stabilization and somewhat higher capital spending should drive strong sequential growth in the quarter. We expect our communications infrastructure will grow slightly, mostly as a result of inventory stabilization. But as Vince mentioned earlier, our largest communications customers are forecasting many new deployments, which should result in higher demand for ADI in the second half of the calendar year. Automotive should also grow in Q2, given our higher opening backlog and generally stronger demand patterns in many regions. We expect our automotive business to continue to outgrow the market as a result of better overall car sales and a very strong ADI product position. For our consumer business, our plan is to be flat in Q2, with the growth of this business very dependent on the product cycles of our customers. In total, we're planning for revenues to grow between 4% and 8% sequentially in Q2. For the year, we should benefit from higher industrial and communications capital spending, which drives a very large portion of our business and also some more content gains in automotive. We expect utilization will be slightly better in Q2 relative to Q1 as we continue to manage our inventories. This, coupled with a stronger product mix, leads us to estimate gross margins will increase to approximately 64% in the second quarter. We're planning for OpEx to remain approximately flat in Q2, and that, coupled with the gross margin increase, should continue to provide very strong operating leverage in Q2. And as a result, we estimate that our earnings in Q2 to be in the range of 49% to 55% a rate of growth quite a bit above what our expected sales growth is. As we look longer term, we have very high confidence in our business strategy, which combines our very high-performance signal processing component technology that we sell to tens of thousands of customers, with a very unique ability to integrate this core technology into systems-level solutions for the largest customers in our served markets. Our customer base around the world is increasingly convinced that our core technology is the best in class, and our increasing systems knowledge, as applied to more integrated products, is becoming a real differentiator in our business. While economic uncertainty certainly remains, we believe that we're making the right trade-offs between continuing to invest for the future while very carefully managing the short-term operations of the company. And if this cycle follows the patterns of previous cycles, we will emerge from this cycle stronger than when the cycle began, and we should continue to provide continuing very solid returns to our shareholders as a result. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Jerry. We plan to run this call until 6 p.m. Eastern Time. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we're now ready for questions from our participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Firstly, I wanted to dig in a little bit into the revenue guidance for next quarter. So your typical Q2 seasonality, if I look over the last 10 years or so, might be somewhere in the ballpark of, say, 1% to 4%. You're guiding up, say, 4% to 8%. Is this the snapback that everybody's been hoping for? Is this just an end to customer de-stocking that's driving that? Are customers moving into a restocking mode? Or do you see the potential for customers move back into a restocking mode? Or would you expect, I guess, a return to seasonal or even potentially sub-seasonal growth as the boost from the end of the de-stocking process tails off? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I mean, again, it's all speculation, Stacy. But our sense is that the increases we're seeing in the orders, which supports the guidance we provided, is really the combination of all those things. It's that -- I think customers are, at the margin, more enthusiastic as some of the uncertainty, particularly in the United States and Europe has been lessened, certainly. And also, as we've been saying particularly with industrial customers, there's been a huge de-stocking going on out there, which is why industrial revenues have fallen so fast. So I think there's some inventory replenishment going on, consistent with a better outlook, particularly in the industrial market, going forward. So I think like in most cycles, it's never a simple answer. It's a combination of things going on that are causing us to have a plan for Q2 in the range that Dave and I had mentioned. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Are customer inventories really that low? I mean, if we're looking at distribution, you're right back to 8 weeks, which is sort of dead in the middle of your sweet spot. [indiscernible] inventory doesn't look all that low? Jerald G. Fishman Yes. It's 8 weeks based on very low sales levels. Distributors are counting to the fact that sales are going to go up next quarter, and they are trying to get their inventory levels in line, particularly with industrial customers, of what they are expecting going forward rather than what they've seen going backward. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. That's helpful. For my follow-up, I just want to dig a little bit into the margins for this quarter. So you had a little bit of upside. I think you guided to 62%. You came in at 62.7%. With utilizations in the 50s and a revenue miss, I was just wondering what drove that margin upside in the quarter. David A. Zinsner The mix was a little bit better than we expected, particularly the mix within our industrial business, so that made it a little bit better. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Which end markets in industrial were driving that? David A. Zinsner It was a combination of instrumentation and automation. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Just a follow-up to Stacy's first question. Particularly in the industrial segment, has the pickup in orders gotten the orders to the consumption levels yet? Or are customers still ordering below consumption level? Jerald G. Fishman I don't really think we know with that much precision. I wish we did. But in the industrial market, we're serving tens of thousands of customers, and a lot of that is coming through distribution. So I think the only thing that we can really communicate is a sense we're getting from the largest customers, from the distributors that their outlook is a little bit better and they are starting to order some product. I think beyond that, all we can do is speculate, and I'd rather not do that. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Sure. In the comm infrastructure segment, you talked about meaningful tailwinds in the second half based on many new deployments. Geographically, can you give us a sense of how that breaks down and the timing of how that breaks down? Is that potentially China first and then maybe the U.S. later? Or how might that work? Vincent T. Roche Well, I think if you look at the public announcements in terms of capital spend, you've seen AT&amp;T, T-Mobile in the U.S. announce very aggressive build-outs during the course of year '13 here. And China Mobile and China Telecom have talked about as well releasing the, if you like, the second part of the 4G TD-SCDMA release as well in China, particularly in the second half of the year. So it seems that if you were to kind of characterize the thing, you'd say America, in particular, and then, to some extent, Japan as well. I know Japan is doing some build-outs in terms of backhaul and wireless infrastructure during the course of the year, but I think China is very much second half as we see it at this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division So my first question, I'm probably the only guy on this call that wants the upturn more than you guys. So... Jerald G. Fishman I don't think so. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division We've heard from a number of other companies that business is picking up. Jerry or Vince or Dave, can you just compare and contrast this year versus last year and why this is or is not a head fake? Is anything different between this year and last year? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's the same exact question we keep badgering our guys with, by the way. But I think last year, there were so many economic uncertainties that emerged right after the beginning of the year that were historic in nature, particularly in the U.S. and Europe but even to some degree in China. So our sense is that those -- anything could happen. The world could get very uncertain very quickly. If you want to be pessimistic, there's a lot of reasons to be so about that. But our sense is that the -- what happened last year was actually quite unique. And this year, although there's still uncertainty, it's not the catastrophic uncertainty that plagued the market when the world collapsed sort of 9 months ago. So that's our plan. That's our assumption. That's the best feedback that we get from the large customers. We're have to just wait and see what happens, but that's the best we can predict right now. And we're just trying to communicate what our plan is through the balance of the year based on the feedback we're getting from the customers. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division And as a follow-up to that, just on bookings, you commented that they continue to get better. What -- do you have any sense of what your book-to-bill is so far this quarter? Is it tracking ahead of what it was last quarter? Jerald G. Fishman We don't really look at that in that way week-to-week. I think just generally, we're seeing stronger order patterns in most regions, and they're noticeably stronger. So given the breadth of the customer base we have, we view that as a good sign right now. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Just on inventory days, I know you guys have been trying to manage it flat on a days basis, and it creeped up a little bit this last quarter. Yet at the same time, we are seeing pretty decent gross margin leverage in April. So should we expect inventory days to sort of hover around the 120-plus level? Or do you think you can bring it down here in April? David A. Zinsner Well, our goal -- if you look back last year and use that as a proxy, our utilization -- we actually increased our utilization up into the 60s last year and let the inventory go up. This time around, we're just tweaking the utilization up a little bit in an effort to get our inventories down a little bit in absolute dollars. And in addition, since revenue will be up, that should bring the days of inventory down several days, I would imagine. So our goal is to get kind of days of inventory down this quarter and kind of position us for even more significant operating -- or gross margin leverage in the back half of the year, assuming the recovery continues. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Okay. And just as a follow-up, guys, if you step back and look at historical revenues and profits, I think April of 2011 was your revenue peak, it was around $800 million and you were generating operating margins of around 38%. If we were to get back to $800 million, is that still sort of a reasonable number to assume for operating margins? Or do you think you can maybe do a little bit better than that? David A. Zinsner Yes. I mean, I think it's a first order. We're definitely committed to getting back to those same growth in operating margins at those similar revenue levels. There are things that we're doing internally to even goose that up further. But first, we'd like to just get the recovery underway. But we have been investing in the industrial and communications markets more significantly than we have in the past so as to have a better mix in terms of gross margins. And we do some things on the finance side to help manage and improve disciplines around cost and pricing to help drive the margins further. So we think all those things are in the cards for us. So at a minimum, we get back to the same gross margins. And hopefully, if we can execute to the things we think we can, we can even do better. Jerald G. Fishman I think that Dave said earlier, one step at a time. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Just kind of following up on the expense question. On -- specifically on OpEx, if we get some good growth over the next several quarters, 4 to 8 quarters, are we going to see a catch-up in the variable portion of OpEx that potentially makes OpEx grow faster than sales? Or have you instituted some limits there that keep OpEx to grow below sales growth? David A. Zinsner I think you've seen in the past, we've done a pretty good job of managing OpEx and not letting one component of it drive the behavior of the operating expenses. Our goal is to grow OpEx at a rate that's slower than the revenue growth. We intend to get leverage from the model. So I think you can expect operating expenses to grow at a rate that's below revenue growth. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And as a follow-up question, in the automotive sector, we have seen historically where that's been among your fastest-growing segments. Has something now changed in that segment where perhaps industrial, especially as we see the restocking there, assume the growth leadership over the next few quarters? Or does the content growth and just overall macro get automotive back to that fastest-growing segment? Vincent T. Roche Well, it has been clearly the fastest-growing segment over the past number of years for ADI. Over just the very, very recent short term, the luxury car manufacturers have shown very, very strong output, for example, particularly the German car manufacturers. So I think it's a mixture of -- over the last number of years, it's been a case of the market is just craving technology to differentiate automobiles in general for powertrain, for safety and for entertainment. And we have a good position in all 3 spaces. We're not overly dependent in any 1 area. All 3 areas are growing nicely. So given also that we've raised our R&amp;D investments in that area in the past 3 years and that we're very well-positioned with the mid- to high-end car manufacturers, in particular, across the globe, as I mentioned in the script, that we're also seeing good penetration at this point in time for our technologies in the Asia region. So it's become a global business for ADI. We have very good reach across the applications, broad technology for MEMS to converters, linear RF and so on. So we're very bullish for the long term. And I think it's really a question of what the market deals rather than ADI specifically, I think will be what the market deals us. Jerald G. Fishman I think another clarification would be that in the short term, I think the snapback in industrial will be a little heavier because it went lower, and the inventory went lower relative to historical levels in the industrial market. So in the short term, you might see a factor snap back on the industrial market. But in the longer term, the automotive market still offers great growth prospects. But in the short term, it might be more weighted towards industrial. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research I had a question on the communications end market. And I think when you came into the quarter, you were expecting it to be flattish, and then it ended up down 12% sequentially. What were the deviance from your expectations for the January quarter? Jerald G. Fishman Oh, we had lower orders. I mean, I don't mean to be facetious, but the -- that business is very lumpy, and we don't get a lot of -- some -- a lot of very accurate forecasts since it's very customer-centric and region-centric and deployment-centric. So I think one of the reasons that our sales was lower is we mis-forecast that. And there's a million reasons but basically was that capital spending in that sector was very weak, particularly into year-end, weaker than we had thought. And as a result, our sales were lower. Again, it's very hard to predict because of the concentration of customers, but that's what happened. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research So there wasn't any notable trend in terms of geography or wireless versus wired? Vincent T. Roche No, it was spread across both the primary segments there and... Jerald G. Fishman As we say, our Eastern business and our Western business. Vincent T. Roche Yes. And across fixed, as well as wireless. So it was very broad-based. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. On the 8 weeks of inventory at your channel customers, the -- recognizing that it's kind of like the normal level, when was the last time it was at 8 weeks? Because it's been below 8, I think, for the last year or so. David A. Zinsner Yes, it's been about 1.5 years since we've been at 8 weeks. Jerald G. Fishman I think the important thing is -- what I pointed out earlier is that the weeks when the revenues are changing quickly is not a great indicator. I mean, distributors order parts based on what they were expecting, not what they have seen last quarter. And when there's a transition in the market, the weeks cause you to come to the wrong conclusion. So you have to basically look at the dollars relative to what the expectation we have for next quarter is. And from that standpoint, that's why distributor orders on us were up. David A. Zinsner Yes. I mean, in absolute dollar terms, it was down about $12 million quarter-over-quarter. And we haven't been at this level in absolute dollars since 2010, as low as this since 2010. So this is actually a pretty low level of inventory. It just happens to show up as 8 weeks because of this quarter's revenue level. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao with Merrill Lynch. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division David, in prior cycles, ADI has seen trough-to-peak incremental gross margins of 85% to 90%. Should we expect similar fall-through during this recovery? Or do you think the shift towards more fabless kind of model could result in a lower gross margin fall-through? David A. Zinsner We haven't really had much of a shift. It's been running about 50% internal and 50% external basically since I've been here. So it's been pretty stable. And every quarter, it might move 1 percentage point to the 49% or to the 51% in the external side. So I don't think that has any impact on our gross margin leverage going forward. I would say, on a rough quarter, it probably is kind of a net 80%, 85% fall-through for gross margins. Of course, any quarter can be slightly different based on the mix. The more -- obviously, the more internal we have, the better the fall-through is. But I think it's a rough quarter that's probably in the ballpark. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay, cool. And then, Jerry, consumer sales fell 20% sequentially in January as expected and kind of guided it to be flat in the second quarter. How was your design win momentum on 2013 products? And how do you sale -- how do you see sales playing out over the course of the year in consumer? Vincent T. Roche Our consumer market is the composition of many submarkets, and we very, very carefully picked our places there. You may have noticed, over the last number of years, we've reduced R&amp;D in general in the consumer space. So we're trying to pick those places where we're playing with the market leaders, we're defining problems that are really meaningful to the user experience, that we're able to convince ourselves that we can solve problems that are really meaningful but also that we can invest and maintain a sustainable position. So clearly, I think the momentum for ADI at this point in time is in the portable arena, in particular, but also the imaging area. We have a broader base business in broadcast. It's a reasonably significant part of the consumer space where we have a very, very broad base of products deployed across a lot of customers. So it's a mix but, I would say, dominated by more portable applications in the areas of audio and imaging. Jerald G. Fishman I mean, I think one of the questions that we get quite often is, \"Is consumer going to start to dominate your business? And is it going to be a much larger percentage of your revenues? Because that's one of the places that you get very high growth.\" I think our operating assumption is not that, that we don't expect consumer to grow as a percentage of our sales from where it is now, which is 15% to 16%. That's by design because of the volatility. And it's much harder. And as Vince was saying, to find places where you can sustainably add value over many, many generations. So I think our sense is there's tremendous opportunities for growth for ADI in the infrastructure markets. And at the same time, there are good opportunities for us if we're very selective in the consumer market. But I think if we had to sort of stand and look into the future, we'd probably say that if you look out a couple of years, consumer sales would certainly not increase as a percentage of our sales. And that's certainly not the way -- or that's certainly the way we're investing our very scarce R&amp;D dollars right now. So if we have to make a guess of that over the next couple of years, it would probably be about the same percentage of sales as it is right now, no more, probably not much less. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division I wonder -- the big picture -- if I could look at your industrial business, it looks like you're down about 25% or so over the last 8 quarters. If you look at that across the subsegments of industrial, I remember I had a thesis that stuff like medical equipment or energy might not come down as much as everything else in a macro weakness. Did that prove to be true? Or are there segments of industrial that held up better? Or was it pretty uniform across the subsegments that you track? Vincent T. Roche Well, the -- I think the part of our business that had the biggest downturn was the instrumentation part. Generally speaking, as you know, the industrial business is very, very CapEx-sensitive. So most parts suffered roughly the same, but I'd say instrumentation was down a little more, particularly large items like big iron ATE, for example, automatic test equipment. But also, factory automation suffered, needless to say. There's been a very rapid build-out of plant and equipment in big manufacturing zones in China, for example. So they're taking a bit of a breather, particularly during the past 12, 15 months. But I think, overall, we saw a fairly, evenly distributed downturn in the subsegments, but instrumentation in this past quarter was a little more affected. Jerald G. Fishman I mean, I think over many, many years, our industrial capital spending has been a good trend predictor for our business. And the correlation is very, very tied to that. So typically, what you see is, when industrial capital spending goes down across all those segments that Vince mentioned, our sales react at a very -- very quickly to that. And they also rebound very quickly from that. So it's basically a question of what's going to happen with industrial capital spending around the world over the next couple of quarters. If it turns out that we see some growth in that, reflective of less uncertainty out there, I think our industrial business will do quite well. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Wondering if you could give us an idea if you are more -- your wireless infrastructure is more centric around 3G or 4G. And any kind of split that you may be able to give us a color would be very helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Vincent T. Roche Well, our business -- we have a broad business in 3G. That's the dominant part of ADI's wireless infrastructure business at this point in time. The fastest-growing part of infrastructure for ADI is obviously 4G, given the rapid deployments in the Western and Eastern hemispheres. I'd say, at this point in time, the split, I don't have the absolute accuracy here. But I believe 4G is somewhere in the region of 10% at this point in time. The 3G is probably in the region of 70% and 20% in 2G, but the shift is very clearly towards 3 and 4G. Jerald G. Fishman And that shift has very positive content implications for ADI. The amount of content we have in 4G is higher than it was in 3G due to the breadth of the product offerings. As Vince talked about it, there's certainly more transceivers -- more radio transceivers in future generations than in prior generations. So I think the design-in base we have in 4G or it's equivalent in most locations is very strong, which is why it's one of the reasons why we're enthusiastic. As those deployments accelerate, we hope, in the second half of the year, we should do fine. Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Very, very helpful. And then, Dave, I'm not sure if you gave a number for the loading of -- expected loading on the fab for the 2Q time frame. David A. Zinsner I said utilization -- you mean on the utilization base? Is that what you're asking, Harsh? Harsh N. Kumar - Stephens Inc., Research Division Yes. David A. Zinsner So I think I've said in the prepared remarks that utilization will be in the high 50s, [indiscernible] in the mid '50s this quarter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Steven Smigie Dave, just a housekeeping question. If we were to get the R&amp;D tax credit back again for fiscal '14, would you likely run around that same 17% in that year as well? David A. Zinsner Yes. Steven Smigie Okay, great. And then just sort of a higher-level growth question. Overall, if we were to get into a more normalized environment, it seems like -- where it seems like maybe we're trending towards -- given all the dollar content increases you're getting on multiple devices out there, would you be able to achieve something like a 3x GDP growth? Let's say global GDP was 4%, could you hit a 12% growth? Or is 8% to 10% sort of more a reasonable assumption? Jerald G. Fishman It's very hard to tell because it's speculation, but I'd say more the latter than the former. Operator The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Dave, just to start off with you, nice dividend increase here after a substantial dividend increase a year ago. Can you just help us understand what the parameters were that helped you and the board settle on the $0.04 increase? And how do we think about any potential for further increase from here? David A. Zinsner Yes, sure. So one thing I think the board has proven and ADI has proven, that we're pretty committed on the dividend. And maybe more broadly speaking, we're pretty committed to returning cash to shareholders. If you go back to 2003 when we started the dividend, and I think shortly after that, started a pretty meaningful buyback program, we've given back about $6.5 billion to investors over the course of the last, you know what, 9, 10 years. So that's a commitment that they've had in the past. That's a commitment that the board and senior management have in the future. So I think, largely, increases in dividend are going to be dependent obviously on earnings. And as we grow earnings, I think you could expect us to continue to grow the dividend. We think it's a great vehicle to kind of systematically and routinely provide cash back to our investors. You'll still see us do buybacks. We're committed to that program as well. I think we said we have a little over $500 million in the buyback program that exists. We'll go out and get more if we need to. We're going to be a bit more opportunistic on the buyback side. It's going to depend a little bit on the stock price and its relationship to kind of historical averages and things like that. But I think you'll see us be committed both on the buyback and the dividend. I mean, our goal was, historically, we had paid back a payout ratio, I think, of about 40%. Our payout -- our goal was to get the payout ratio up. We didn't have a specific number in mind other than to say we wanted to be -- it to be more meaningful as a percent of our earnings. And that was the basis around why we increased the dividend this quarter. The other thing is, I think we felt like we had some confidence around a quarter, too, that was going to be much better than our first quarter. We felt we were getting our legs under us from the inventory work-downs that we had experienced in the prior few quarters. And so now seems like the appropriate time to ramp the dividend again. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question. And I know there's been a lot of focus on industrials. And this is either for Jerry or Vince. If you look at your end markets, it seems like they're all coming back pretty strongly. But I'm wondering if you can provide some of the same color on a geographic basis. Are you seeing a fairly uniform recovery geographically? Or are there certain geographies that are really leading and others that are lagging? And if so, which would those be? Vincent T. Roche I'd say -- let me start with the weakest. I'd say the recovery in Japan, if there is one, is very, very muted. Europe is getting back to some kind of a strength, but I'd say the better growth is in America and China, somewhere between America and Europe at this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with RBC Capital Markets. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Dave, for you. CapEx for 2013, can you offer a number for us? David A. Zinsner Yes, sure. Our goal is to be around $100 million. I think we put a range in there of $90 million to $120 million or so, give or take. I think right now, the way the trajectory is working, it looks like we're going to land pretty much on the $100 million. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division All right. And can you highlight for us where you think you might run into some capacity constraints? What I'm really looking for here is some sort of impetus in the market where we might find that lead times are to stretch the soonest. David A. Zinsner I don't think we're going to be the great proxy for lead time expansion. We're pretty good at keeping our lead times pretty short. As I mentioned, we're only bringing our utilization up to the high 50s this quarter. We have 121 days of inventory. We have -- we seem to be in pretty good shape on the back-end, but that's the nature of our model. We like to be on the side of keeping our lead times short, not have a lot of double bookings and stuff. At some point, I would imagine some competitors who manage things much more tightly, you might run into that situation. But that's probably not going to be us, Doug. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division All right. If I could, Jerry, for you and Vince. Could you offer some commentary on what you're seeing as far as ASP trends? I know there were some efforts a few years back to try to push some of your ASPs higher. Has that been successful? And do you think you could move your ASP mix over time? Vincent T. Roche Well, it depends very much on the market. In general, by the way, our ASPs are very, very stable. As Jerry mentioned just a little while ago, we are seeing ASP extensions particularly in areas like communications infrastructure where for successive generations of technology deployment, we're just getting more content, more value and per application. The same is true in the automotive space. I would say industrial is very, very stable. But as a corporation, we're always looking for ways to just essentially price the technology that we have to the value we're creating and do our best to hold it. So -- but I think it's true across the board. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, I mean, I think the point that Vince raised, this is exactly the right one, is that there's a lot of ways to get your prices up. One way is you can just go after your customers and say, \"By the way, what you used to buy for x, you're now buying for 1.05x.\" And generally, that doesn't have a happy ending. There are other ways to do it in terms of price management, in terms of making sure that your value keeps going up to customers. And I think we're more on the value creation side than just random price increases, which is not our history and not what our customers expect to do. But when you have 10,000 products that you sell to 100,000 customers, a very small movement to that make a big difference. And there's a lot of more professional price management that we can do that is quite well-anticipated by our customers. So it's really a whole bunch of things, but these things are very long-term programs. And we do see beginnings of movement on some of that stuff. But just to clarify because somebody asked us this question last time, we're not going out just raising prices willy-nilly to customers because we know that doesn't end well. Vincent T. Roche I think you're aware that a large part of our industrial business, for example, goes through the channel, and a large part of that business again is with smaller customers, a lot of products, smaller customers with very, very long life cycles. And that business tends to run off book cost forever. So a large part of our business is essentially transacted once, and we never have to reprice that business again. So most of the critical management of pricing is obviously with larger customers in large market sectors. Jerald G. Fishman One of the other point, I think, that's worth noting is that one of the very unique services that ADI had to offer for many, many years and continues to in the future is we don't discontinue many products. So for these customers that Vince was talking about that has very long life cycles, many of these customers buy our products for 20 years. And a lot of it -- and this is true with the small accounts, it's also true in some of the very large accounts. And when we go out and visit those customers, we hear that, that's a very, very important aspect of what customers really value because when they're not using many parts for application, to go redesign a 20-year-old part out doesn't get them great economic benefit and if the margin causes them great economic pains. So I think we have concluded that, that is very valuable to customers. Our customers are willing to pay us for that because the design costs of changes is so high. So these are really sophistications of our model as compared to vast changes in corporate philosophies. Ali Husain Great. Thank you. Well, that's all our callers for today. As we conclude our Q&amp;A session, I'd like to thank you, all, for your participation.

"content": "    - Board declares $0.34 per share cash dividend   NORWOOD, Mass.---- Analog Devices, Inc. , a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2013, which ended August 3, 2013.   ADI delivered solid results for the third quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased by 2% and our operating model produced excellent leverage, driving diluted EPS growth of 10%, excluding special items, said Vincent Roche, President and CEO. Profitability and cash flow were very strong, and we returned $105 million to our shareholders through cash dividends.   By end market, industrial applications totaled 47% of revenue, communications infrastructure was 21% of revenue, and automotive and consumer applications were 18% and 15% of revenue, respectively.   Order rates improved across all of our end markets during the third quarter, and we saw the strongest sequential revenue growth from products used in communications infrastructure applications. It appears that customer order rates were in-line with consumption, keeping inventories low, continued Mr. Roche.   There are signs that a gradual recovery in the macroeconomic environment is underway and we are in a strong position to benefit from the return of capital investments in communications and industrial infrastructure programs. As a result our outlook for the fourth quarter is for our sales to grow in the range of $675 million to $700 million, up from $674 million in the third quarter, said Mr. Roche.   ADI also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on September 11, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 2013.   Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2013   Revenue totaled $674 million   Gross margin was 64.5% of revenue   Operating margin was 30.9% of revenue   Diluted EPS was $0.57, excluding special items   Cash flow from operations was $220 million, or 32.6% of revenue   Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.   Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2013   The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.   Revenue estimated to be in the range of $675 to $700 million   Gross margin estimated to be approximately 65%   Operating expenses estimated to increase by approximately 1%   Tax rate estimated to be between 14% and 15%   Diluted EPS estimated at $0.55 to $0.61   Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET   ADI will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone .   A replay will be available two hours after the completion of the call. The replay may be accessed for up to two weeks by dialing 855-859-2056  and providing the conference ID: 18639688, or by visiting investor.analog.com.   Non-GAAP Financial Information   This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.   Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.   Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP other expense, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.   Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures   The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.   The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Restructuring-Related Expenses. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   Stock-based Compensation Expense. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, following the death of the Companys CEO, the Company recorded $6.3 million of stock-based compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of his restricted stock unit agreement. This stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effect have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP other expense and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Debt Extinguishment Costs: In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company redeemed its outstanding 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July1, 2014. The Company recognized a net loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $10.2 million, which was comprised of a make-whole premium, the recognition of unamortized proceeds received on an interest rate swap associated with the debt and the write off of unamortized debt issuance and discount costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they are one time in nature and have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Tax-Related Items. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a one-time $3.4 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a $6.6 million tax benefit as a result of the reversal of prior period tax liabilities. In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a one-time $1.7 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.   Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors   Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP other expense, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.   Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Analog Devices  believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP other expense, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.   Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP other expense, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time.

In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods.

This webcast will also be archived at our IR website.  Participating in todays call are Jerry Fishman, President and CEO, and Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part of the call, Jerry and Dave will present our fourth quarter and year end results as well as our short term outlook, and then well open it up for questions during the last part of the call. During todays call we will refer to several non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for one time items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in todays earnings release, which was posted on the IR website. Weve also updated the schedules on our IR website which include the historical quarterly and annual summary key analysis for continuing operations, as well as historical quarterly and annual information for product revenue from continuing operations by end market and by product type. Next, Id ask you to please note that the information were about to discuss includes forward-looking statements which include risks and uncertainties. The companys actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those described in the companys SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking information that is provided by the company in this call represents the companys outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause the companys outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast which is November 23, 2009 With that Ill turn it over to our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald G. Fishman  Well, thanks, Mindy, and thanks to everybody for joining us on todays call. As you can see from the earnings announcement we put out earlier today, our fourth quarter was a very strong quarter for ADI. Our revenues increased by about 16% or about $80 million sequentially to $572 million, which was well ahead of the earlier forecast that we communicated to you last quarter. We experienced the strongest sequential growth in automotive and consumer products, but I think most importantly we also began to see very strong growth in our traditional industrial products, which grew 14% sequentially. Communications revenues declined very slightly as a result of inventory rebalancing at some of our largest infrastructure customers. PT revenues which are now a very diminumous part of our business also grew sequentially. Revenues grew sequentially in virtually every product category at ADI in our fourth quarter.  Year-over-year and the full year results by end market and product category, as Mindy mentioned earlier, are available on ADIs Investor Relations website for your review.  Importantly, our gross margins for the quarter increased by 220 basis points sequentially to 56.3%, which was also well ahead of our expectations. And thats despite a sales mix that favored lower margin automotive and consumer products. This increase was primarily due to higher sales and an increase in our industrial business, which provided slightly better factory utilization. Inventories declined to 92 days and are now at historically low levels. Despite much lower inventories, our service levels to our customers remains very good and our lead times continue to be very short for most of our products.  Our operating expenses increased approximately 3% or about $6 million sequentially, but were down over 19% from the same period last year, excluding one time items. The sequential increase in Q4 was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense, resulting from the 650 basis point sequential improvement in our operating margins in Q4. All other expenses during the quarter were essentially flat to Q3 levels.  As a result of very strong sequential sales gains, coupled with the 220 basis point improvement in gross margins and a 430 basis point improvement in operating expenses, operating margins expanded to 22.5% up from 16% last quarter. Interestingly, for each additional revenue dollar, we drove about approximately $0.62 to operating profit. This really demonstrates the very significant leverage that weve built into our model in the past year or two through manufacturing consolidations and corporate wide cost reductions, which is in line with the plan that we communicated to you over the last few quarters. In Q4 earnings per share grew to $0.36, which was up 64% sequentially from Q3. About $0.01 of that increase was the result of a year end tax adjustment. So overall, Q4 was a very successful quarter by most measures, as we executed on our important objective to emerge from this cycle a more focused and a more profitable company. So now Ill turn the mike over to Dave, whos going to review the financials in a bit more detail. David A. Zinsner  Thanks Jerry. As Jerry stated, revenues were $572 million, which was a 16% increase from the prior quarter and a 13% decrease from the prior year. Orders increased substantially again this quarter. We closed the fourth quarter with a book to bill that was well above one, resulting in higher backlog. Gross margins were 56.3%, which was more than 100 basis points higher than expectations. This was up from 54.1%, which we reported in the third quarter. As Jerry mentioned this was due to higher sales and an increase in our industrial business, which provided slightly better factory utilization.  Inventory on our balance sheet declined by $23 million or 8% this quarter and days of inventory fell to 92 days, which is a recent record for ADI.  We increased utilization slightly this quarter. However, demand from our OEM customers and distributors was even stronger, which was the primary driver of the reduction in inventory. Looking ahead to next quarter, were expecting utilization for our two internal fabs to increase again modestly to respond to the increased level of demand. Days of inventory will likely remain at a similar level to this quarter. Weve been able to maintain lead times in line with prior quarters, and feel comfortable that we can operate at these historically low levels of inventory. Distributor inventory increased slightly. However, days of inventory remained relatively flat, an indication that the channel continues to watch inventories closely. As we expected, third quarter 2009 gross margins appear to have represented a trough for this cycle. We believe that gross margins will continue to improve throughout the next several quarters, and expect that we will be above 60% by the end of fiscal 2010. There are several drivers to this gross margin improvement. First, were just beginning to realize the savings from our two fab consolidations, which will begin in earnest in fiscal Q1 and continue throughout the year. Second, we should experience a richer product mix in 2010 as a result of the reprioritization of our investments over the past few years. Third, we have had a significant focus on inventory levels during this cycle. And the result? Weve kept utilization low when sales declined. As our industrial business grows, were anticipating utilization will steadily improve, which would drive further gross margin improvement. And lastly, were expecting depreciation to gradually decline over the next several years as we keep capital spending at historically low levels, approximately 3% of sales, reflecting higher external wafer purchases, which require less capital spending at ADI.  For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $16 million, and for the full year they were $56 million. This represented a 64% decline from fiscal 2008. Operating expenses were $193 million, up $6 million or 3% from the prior quarter, but down $46 million or 19% from fourth quarter of the prior year, including one time items. The increase quarter over quarter was almost entirely the result of increased variable compensation expense on a 63% improvement in operating income. We have seen solid results from our initiative to get more leverage from our operating expenses. In fact, the last time we were at similar revenue levels to Q4, which was approximately $575 million in revenue, our operating expenses were more than $75 million higher on an annualized basis. For the first quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately flat with the fourth quarter. In subsequent quarters, were planning modest sequential increases as revenues increase.  Other expenses were approximately $1 million as expected. At this point were not expecting a rise in short term rates, which would benefit our non-operating income, so we expect that other expenses will be approximately $1 million next quarter as well. Our annual tax rate was lower than the rate we anticipated at the end of our third quarter, so we trued up our tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which had the effect of increasing our EPS by $0.01 per share. Next year we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%.  Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million this quarter and were expecting weighted average shares for next quarter of about 300 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.36, down 27% from $0.49 in the year ago period, but it was up 64% from $0.22 in the immediately prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $163 million or 29% of sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we had $16 million in capital expenditures, which resulted in free cash flow of $147 million or 26% of revenue. We also paid out $58 million this quarter in dividends. Total cash and investments at the end of fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, up $92 million from $1.7 billion last quarter due to continued strong cash flow from operations and low capital spending. Net cash after debt was approximately $1.4 billion. Our AR balance increased slightly due to the increase in shipments. However, our DSO stayed relatively flat at 48 days and we have no customers that are late to their payment terms. In summary, this was a very solid financial quarter for ADI. Our goal has been to drive more leverage in our model during this cycle and Q4 represented evidence that we are beginning to see the expected expansion of gross and operating margins. Now Ill turn the call over to Jerry to discuss key end market trends and our short term outlook. Jerald G. Fishman   Thanks Dave. Revenues from our very broad base of industrial customers, which are about 52% of our total revenues in Q4, were up 17% sequentially. And as you might remember, that category is inclusive of automotive and healthcare, both of which grew at very high sequential rates last quarter. External to the automotive and healthcare segments are our clients and industrial revenues which include process control, factory automation instrumentation, grew approximately 14% sequentially. Automotive sales were particularly strong, due in part to automotive stimulus programs, providing a boost to sales in North America and Europe, but also as a result of a much richer automotive product portfolio that were now selling at ADI. Revenues from automotive customers increased 37% sequentially in Q4, reaching levels close to their peak, which we experienced in the third quarter of 2008. In Q4, sales of our battery monitoring, brake sensing and automotive MEMs products, all increased significantly. And we had further design activity for our lithium ion battery monitoring solution for hybrid and for electric vehicle systems, with suppliers in North America and Europe and also in China. Revenues from our healthcare customers returned to growth this quarter, much as we had expected, and increased 17% on a sequential basis, although still quite a bit down from the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, designing activity and healthcare customers continues their very rapid pace and we believe we have the opportunity to grow our share in many important areas of this market, particularly in advance imaging systems, where our newest 128 channel, 24 bit converters enable four dimensional views of internal organs.  Based on the strength of both the OEM and distribution orders, which has continued into November, and the growth in our backlog, were expecting a further increase in industrial sales in the first quarter.  In the communications market, sales of optical, networking and wired infrastructure products all increased from the previous quarter. Wireless infrastructure products declined slightly as a result of delayed GSM deployments in developing regions, which resulted in inventory level adjustments by some of our customers. Deployments of the more advanced 3G systems, which enable high speed data services, remained strong in the developed regions as operators continue to upgrade their networks to capture the increased mobile data traffic and our sales to these 3G applications increased slightly in the quarter. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect continued modest sales growth from 3G system upgrades and for sales from GSM applications to remain flat to Q4 levels.  Looking forward, our customers expect contracts to be awarded in China for the next phase of 3G deployment in early 2010. And depending on the actual timing of these deployments, these should drive upside revenues in the out quarters. As weve mentioned previously, our market position in China is very, very strong and we expect that as those deployments get made they should positively impact our revenues. Revenues from consumer customers were about 25% of our revenues, up 38% sequentially with very strong sales in all major consumer applications. Q4 as you might remember is typically a very strong consumer quarter for ADI, as builds get done ahead of the holiday season. Consumer revenue has now returned to pre-downturn levels with sales increasing for the third consecutive quarter, albeit at a more significant rate in Q4. Contributing to our fourth quarter growth in consumer products were increasing sales of our analog front end products for cameras, HDMI related products and also MEMs based products as well. We expect consumer sales to be down in the first quarter as they typically are, as ordering typically slows following the Christmas build. Looking forward to 2010, we continue to very closely monitor our customer ordering patterns for clearer signals about the prospects for growth for the year. During the fourth quarter of 2009, order rates from end customers accelerated very significantly and grew by approximately 17% sequentially. And as a result, backlog for delivery in the next 90 days grew substantially. Our belief is that this atypically strong growth in Q4 was really the result of three things. First, overall many economies began to improve from the depressed levels of 2009. This is particularly noteworthy in our industrial business, which as I mentioned earlier includes factory automation, process control, and factory instrumentation and scientific instrumentation. In addition, the automotive stimulus programs no doubt provided a boost to sales to automotive customers.  Secondly, many customers have now moved out to an inventory accretion mode rather from an inventory depletion mode that theyve been in over the past year, as they now have become incrementally more positive about their businesses and have worked their inventories down to extremely low levels. Thirdly, ADI is benefiting for what appears to be a very rich new product cycle as a result of having made more focused investments over the past few years. So we expect that our industrial revenues will continue to grow sequentially in Q1 in line with higher manufacturing activity worldwide and our higher opening backlog. For the first quarter were expecting automotive and communication sales to be relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter. In addition, were planning for consumer sales to decline in Q1, given the large sequential revenue increases in Q4, some of which may not repeat in Q1. And also very typical seasonal patterns for lower consumer sales that we often see in Q1. So as a result, when we add up the growth were expecting in all the market segments, were planning for revenues in Q1 to be approximately flat to Q4 levels, and up 20% from the same period last year. Our current planning assumption for our 2010 plan is for revenues to increase throughout 2010 beginning in our second quarter.  Were planning for gross margin to [inaudible] again in Q1 as a result of lower infrastructure costs and a much richer mix of industrial sales. Our current plan is for gross margins to increase by an additional 150 to 200 basis points to 58% to 58.5%. We anticipate gross margins to continue to expand throughout 2010 for many of the reasons that Dave mentioned earlier. Were planning for operating expenses in Q1 to remain relatively flat to Q4 levels, in line with our plan to achieve very high operating leverage going forward. For the balance of this year were planning for only modest increases in operating expenses as revenues increase. Given this level of revenues and margin, and our expense plan, our plan is for diluted earnings from continuing operations in Q1 to be approximately $0.36 to $0.37, excluding restructuring charges that we plan to take in Q1 associated with the final closure of our fab in Cambridge. Were planning for continuing low capital expenditures for 2010 in the range of $60 to $70 million or 3% of sales with depreciation currently running at about 6% of sales. So in summary, overall were executing well on our plan to transform ADIs business model to produce good growth and higher margins. First we continue to realign our investments and our product portfolio to better focus on the most promising and the most sustainable opportunities where ADIs technology makes a fundamental difference to our customers. Just recently we announced a major reorganization of our design, marketing and selling resources, which we believe will better balance our product or technology centric structure that has made us so successful for decades, with a parallel market facing structure that will make it much easier for customers to gain access to the breadth of ADIs technology. This structure will provide much greater strategic clarity at ADI and I believe really help us focus our resources on the highest corporate priorities. Secondly, we have fundamentally reduced and we will continue to reduce ADIs infrastructure costs worldwide. As a result of these and other actions, we believe were very well positioned to deliver significant operating leverage as revenues increase, as I think we amply demonstrated in our Q4 when earnings increased over 60% on a 16% revenue increase. In just the past 12 months weve consolidated two complex wafer fabs, weve reduced inventory levels from 141 days to 92 days, and weve kept customer service levels high during the entire process.  Our continuing short lead times reduce the risk of double ordering from our customers and our distributors, and I believe provide competitive advantages relative to suppliers whose lead times have extended.  And finally, despite all the tremendous challenges during 2009, weve continued to invest for the future. This strategy produced a record crop of 300 new products in 2009. We expect many of these innovations to be strong growth drivers for ADI over the coming quarters, as these products help our customers solve extraordinarily difficult signal processing challenges. With Q4 new product sales amongst the highest levels in the history of ADI, many of these recently introduced innovative products have shown excellent revenue momentum right out of the gate. And we should continue to enjoy the benefits of these products in 2010 and beyond. As weve said many times in these calls, our long-term success will often be dependent on how we respond to downturns which occur routinely in our business. Last year we presented a strategy for navigating through the downturn which we believe would result in ADI emerging in an even stronger position than weve been in before the economy went into a tailspin. Over the past year by maintaining a relentless focus on innovation and executing our strategic priorities, including the aggressive streamlining of our cost structure, weve emerged in a very strong competitive position, perhaps the strongest position in our history.  During the past few years Analogs employees around the world have stepped up and embraced these challenges with a great sense of purpose and determination, which we believe will reward investors in the coming years.  Mindy Kohl Thank you Jerry. During todays Q&amp;A period please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow on question. Well give you another opportunity to ask additional questions as we have time remaining. Operator, were now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session  Operator   Your first question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse I guess Jerry and David, when you talk about the order rates and the October quarter being up 17% sequentially and backlog growing, Im kind of wondering why just flat revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter. Is that typically a quarter where youre dependent upon less turns? Or are you just throwing in some tops down conservatism, just kind of given the volatility in the macro environment? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think certainly you know were always cautious during all these periods where you cant quite predict the ordering patterns and the revenue patterns as you normally can during a stable market. So you know we are running the company conservatively. Were setting the expense objective conservatively and the revenue objectives conservatively. Certainly we have the capacity to ship more than flat this quarter, even though our inventory levels have come down quite a bit we have very good coverage on inventory, very short lead times. So if it does turn out that the revenues turn out to be stronger, then well certainly be ready to do it, but we are trying to manage the company relatively conservatively, given all the uncertainty out there in the markets.  I mean typically our first quarter is a down sequential quarter mostly because the consumer market goes down and we get less days of sales for our industrial products, which tends to, you know, generally we were down a couple of percent to 5% in the first quarter. So I think with flat sales in Q1 thats going to be a better quarter than we typically have sequentially. And thats I think particularly true given the very large increase we had last quarter which you know any time where companies like ADI or any of our competitors puts up a, you know, a mid double digit sequential number you have to be a little cautious for the next quarter. And I think thats what were trying to do. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse  Dave, if my notes are right, I believe you talked about utilization rates being about 45% in the July quarter. They picked up here a little bit. I guess Im kind of curious, at what utilization level do you start to see lead times stretching out or I guess whats your ability to keep lead times from not stretching out, given the pick up in end demand? David A. Zinsner Well I think I said in the actual prepared statement that you know now were starting to rethink the model on inventory. And originally we thought we would operate in the 100 to 110 day range. Weve operated now in the 92 range for a quarter. Lead times have not moved out at all. Weve been able to service every customer out there. So I think were now operating in a different model for inventory whereas you know more in the kind of 90 to 100 days, which makes sense. Were becoming more of a hybrid between internal and external manufacturing. We have the ability to order wafers relatively quickly from our external foundry. So you know I think that were kind of comfortable at this point where the range is. Well pick up utilization again next quarter a little bit, just to catch up a little bit since we obviously brought down inventory quite a bit. But you know I dont imagine it going up too significantly until we start to see industrial continue to grow. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse  But, Dave, I guess, is there utilization level where lead times will stretch out and youll have to build inventory and customers will have to build inventory? Or is that no longer applicable just given the flex capacity? David A. Zinsner I think were at, you know, 50% utilization now, give or take. And we have plenty of head room to bring that utilization up. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, we can respond reasonably rapidly. You know the equipments installed, labor for it is leased on the engineering and management level is pretty well fully staffed. So if we decide to, we can ramp that production pretty quickly. Our plan right now is to ramp it slowly as long as we can keep the lead times down. And you know to the extent we sense that lead times are going to extend, we would ramp it more quickly and that wouldnt take us very long. But our sense is to try to keep inventories low and to keep the lead times low. And you know, so far weve been able to do that, even though we got surprised on the upside on the revenues by quite a bit this quarter, we really didnt run into any shortages of any consequence, and our production people feel pretty good about being able to respond pretty quickly to anything that comes our way in the next couple of quarters. Operator Your next question comes from Uche Orji UBS. Uche Orji - UBS Jerry, let me just follow up a little bit on the lead time comments. You know through this reporting season we havent really had many companies admit to having long lead times, its always people saying we dont have long lead times, but the market lead time is higher. Can you give us a sense of you know just in terms of your vantage view of the market, you know, where lead times really are? I know yours are short, but in terms of your ability to take market share as a consequence of long lead times in the industry, just help us quantify the way it [tends]. Jerald G. Fishman I think, you know, there are a group of competitors out there that I think have and typically do keep their lead times very short and they dont make [mets] of changes in their production levels. And I think we have other competitors that have really fallen behind on their ability to supply customers. So I think its really a mixed bag. And you know Ill leave it up to each of our competitors to say who they are. But it really is a mixed bag out there. You know for a while the foundries were struggling to keep up, but I think by and large you know the foundries have kept up, at least with our requests from them. And so I dont expect that theres huge shortages out there except from a few suppliers in a few markets but not across the board. So I cant speak for anyone elses lead times or for any one elses plans to keep them lower. I can just speak for Analogs and were going to keep them low. Uche Orji UBS  Well, just as a follow up, can you talk about within your product areas amplifiers, I mean its the only product [capacity] rate that did not grow double digits this quarter. Clearly underlying that does that mean the amplifier business thats restricting growth within that business? Jerald G. Fishman No. I think it turns out that when you have the most strength in the automotive business and the consumer business, a lot of those, you know, they have a lot of converters and amplifiers built into them, but theyre typically more integrated products where you know they go into the other category, the other Analog category. So I dont think theres any real information there. It just turns out that a large part of the strength or the most strength is in automotive and consumer products which arent as prevalent as stand alone converters and amplifiers as say the industrial business is. Uche Orji UBS  And just one last question on the communication and venture correction you mentioned, I know you expect to see some growth picking up next year in the communication infrastructure business. Can you just talk about where you think where would inventory correction [inaudible]?  Jerald G. Fishman Well I think its, you know, its lasted a couple of quarters and lasted a little bit longer than you know many of us would have believed. You know you might remember that prior to a couple of quarters ago, the year-over-year increases were staggering at the beginning of the, you know, downturn of the cycle. That was the only thing that was keeping most of us running. You know our sense is that theres another big TDS, CDMA deployment coming up in China. The tenders are out there and you know theres varying accounts of you know whether thatll be our first quarter or our second quarter or our third quarter. Its very, very hard to tell.  But I think it will happen this year and when it does happen, you know, well do quite well, as well as with 3G deployments in other locations around Europe and the United States. One of the big variables is, you know, we still sell stuff into the older GSM standards, mostly in the developing countries. And that tends to bounce around a little bit. So I mean this business has always been a up or down business and the only thing we can do is make sure that our share remains strong, which it is; that our content keeps increasing in each of those base stations which it has; and now the, you know, quarter-to-quarter thats going to be a lumpy business. Operator Your next question comes from James Covello - Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs  First question, where do you guys think we are relative to the inventory correction in the industrial segment in particular? In other words, do you think are you still under shipping your customer demand in the industrial segment or do you think weve caught up there now? Jerald G. Fishman Well thats very, very hard to be definitive on. You know we serve a lot of those customers through our distribution partners and you know the conversations weve had with the larger distributors more recently indicates that they dont think theres a lot of inventory building going on in the industrial customers. You know they think theyre resetting their inventory models. You know their guess is Q1 is going to be atypically strong as they sort of complete that. But what theyre most optimistic on is that these companies are thinking theyre really going to grow. And you know when you look around in the United States, its sort of hard to get enthusiastic about what you see going on in the industrial race in the United States and whats going on in many U.S. companies.  But if you look outside the U.S. and the large industrial customers we have in other locations, theyre doing pretty well and their business continues to grow. And increasingly a larger percentage of our business is now coming outside the U.S. and industrial customers as well as the large base we have inside the United States. So I mean its sort of hard to tell, but all we can do is repeat what were hearing from the distributors and our largest customers. And they tell us and they seem to be quite confident that theyre not building a lot of inventory, theyre just replenishing it and theyre, you know, probably at least partially if not mostly done with that. But the reason theyre buying product now is because theyre expecting next year to be better than this year. James Covello - Goldman Sachs  Dave, what do you think it would take for you to surpass your previous historical margin levels in this upcoming cycle? David A. Zinsner Well I think we are going to surpass the previous cycle. Weve got a number of things, tailwinds in our favor. One the two fab consolidations drive about $65 million of annualized savings. In the first quarter well start to see the first of the savings will probably be somewhere in the kind of $5 to $7 million for the first quarter. So thats going to be a good tailwind for us. Depreciation is also coming down. I mentioned that capital spending is now lower at the company given our kind of our, you know, half external, half internal kind of model, give or take. So thats also going to drive some good savings. I talked about the mix. I think Jerry talked about mix as well. We think industrial mix is going to improve over the course of next year. And so those things should all drive good margin improvement. We think well beat the previous peak, which was about 61%, and we feel pretty confident of that fact at the moment. Jerald G. Fishman And a lot of the things weve done on the OpEx side, which is the other really great driver of what margins we ultimately achieve, you know as we had mentioned some of those things creep back in very slowly, but a large part of those things are not going to creep in. And so were going to wind up as Dave mentioned at the same revenue levels that we had. Last time we had this revenue level we had fundamentally lower costs and I think the costs of the company are going to continue to remain under very, very tight control, given the margin leverage that were seeking. And I think also that were learning how to manage the business with less OpEx, and I think thats going to continue to go on. So I think for both of those reasons in terms of the gross margins and the OpEx line, you know we still think from here weve got plenty of leverage left. And when we get all that leverage, well be at higher margins than we were at comparable sales in the last cycle. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities Jerry, when you talked about the [disti] I believe going from depletion to accretion mode, usually that doesnt end well. Can you just talk to us about how far along that process they are and maybe give us kind of a historical context? Jerald G. Fishman I think theyre relatively past that process. I mean what really happened is, you know, the distributors and you know in fact all of the customers just stopped when the business went to hell, the credit markets, you know, didnt allow people to borrow to buy inventories and so on. And I think if you look at what theyve been doing, you know, theyve been trying to get back on the right number of days in the channel. You know Dave mentioned earlier that distributor inventory hasnt gone up at all in days. And I think that, you know, when you talk to the distributors, you know they basically are very, very tight on what theyre trying to do. You know for a quarter or so wed see the orders on us be ahead of the orders that the end customers would place on them. But increasingly over the last month or two, youd see those lines starting to converge. So I think theres been a catch up in trying to get their inventories up, but I think theyre being incredibly tight compared to what weve seen in previous cycles on their inventory management. And if you believe them and, you know, when you look them in the eye, I do believe them, that I dont think theyre going to go out there and just randomly buy inventory right now. I think the level of discipline everybody has, from the customers to distributors to even us, is much, much greater than its ever been. So you know theres always that risk that you mentioned and for those of us whove been around a long time weve all seen the phenomena you mention. But you know we watch our distributor turns very, very closely. We hit their inventories every single week and we look at them very closely. And were determined not to overstock our distributors. And its not really a battle right now because theyre not running ahead any more of what their customers are ordering from them, which is why the turns are staying about constant. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities  I guess just so we can quantify it a little bit, how does the days theyre carrying now, I know that theyre flat sequentially as you said, but how does that absolute days level compare to either where they were a year ago or some historical normal level? David A. Zinsner  Its a little bit lower than normal levels. You know I think were in a new environment where you know normal levels are a lot lower. Jerald G. Fishman Thats what we believe, that the divergence between those lines are converging and it might be that the distributors really want to run their businesses at lower levels, and theyre certainly talking like theyd rather do that. And I think thats a good idea. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities  I guess as a follow up question then switching to gross margin and the outlook for it to go up 150 to 200 basis points basically, can you just walk us through the metrics there? Because I would think with mix and utilization being positive, plus you get the first batch of the Limerick cost savings, I would think it could have been at least what you guided to if not potentially a little bit better. So if you could just help quantify those levers, please. David A. Zinsner Well, it can always be better obviously, but I think the way were thinking utilization probably adds another 75 basis points, the fab consolidation probably adds another 75 basis points and then mix, you know, is probably another 50 to 100 basis points. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah - Barclays Capital. Romit Shah - Barclays Capital It seems like you have the ability to drive gross margins into the mid-60% range, but if you look at companies that are in that range or higher, they dont seem to be growing as fast. And so my question is Jerry, do you think theres a correlation there? And if so, you know, how do you think about balancing revenue growth and margins at ADI? Jerald G. Fishman Well thats something you know we worry about and look at and think about very, very carefully as we do this thing. You know theres a lot of ways to get your gross margin up that are very negative to sales growth. You know you can go out and raise all your prices and see what happens, you know, play chicken with the customers. And that tends all the time to have a very deleterious effect on your revenue growth, both in the short term Id say and the long term. And the other thing you could do is you can get your costs down and increase your gross margins. And you know our fundamental strategy is more the latter than the former.  You know we have a higher average selling price for our products than many of our direct competitors and I think we have the opportunity to run much higher margins as a result of that. So you know Ive always said that were not turning away a lot of business at 60% gross margin to try and get the margins up by a point or something. You know any business that comes along thats credible, you know, were in. So I think its mostly a question for Analog of cost reduction rather than price increases and thats what were going to do. Thats what we have done over the last year or so and thats where the focus is going to be. And I think if you follow that leg of the stool, you dont lose business. In fact theres an opportunity to get even more business because you can be more price competitive.  So were not going to push Analog down the rat hole of, you know, lets take 75% of the revenue thats above some gross margin and give the rest of it away. I dont think thats a good long term strategy for any company and certainly not for Analog. You know we have businesses as you know where we never expected we could get a return on the R&amp;D investment, either at the gross margin or the operating margin level, and those businesses weve decreased investment in or gotten out of. But this isnt a relentless pushing Analog for gross margin at any sales revenue level, its to have better than industry average growth at increasing gross margins, and I think we can accomplish both of those things simultaneously by really focusing on the cost part of the equation. Romit Shah - Barclays Capital  Do you think 65% is a realistic gross margin target down the road? Jerald G. Fishman I think when we get to 60, well have this conversation again. But as Dave said, we have a lot of tailwinds and well see how it goes. I mean were putting up a lot of gross margin leverage, you know, the last quarter and were going to put up a bunch more this quarter. Were going to put more up by the balance of the year. Lets see how we do over the next couple of quarters and well put up a new model when we do. Operator Your next question comes from David Wu - GC Research Ltd. David Wu - GC Research Ltd. Just remind us, how big is the automotive business in the fourth quarter? Jerald G. Fishman In dollars or percentage? David Wu - GC Research Ltd.  Well, either way. David A. Zinsner Automotive is a little bit north of 10%. David Wu - GC Research Ltd.  And the other thing I was wondering is youve been watching the distributors improve their inventory turns but how do you monitor your OEMs and they go through their, do you have hubs with them? And how do you monitor their behavior relative to you know inventory depletion or too much accretion? Some of our wonderful analysts are thinking that accretion may be too much in the very near future but. Jerald G. Fishman Well I mean all the data thats out there indicates that the distributor inventories lower last quarter you know than they were the quarter before, so the data out there does not support that contention that weve seen. With the large customers, David, all we can really do is, you know, we do sell to some of them through hubs so we can really get to see whats there. We have very close contact with our largest 200 accounts and when we talk to them we talk a lot about supply. So all we can do is, you know, its not a highly quantitative model with the large customers, but we tend to have a reasonably good sense of you know the attitudes of our customers and whether theyre piling up stuff.  We have a lot of years of historical sales and inventory data from our large customers, so you know we crank through those numbers pretty hard. And when we get a sense that one of our large customers is building inventory on us, we talk about it quite directly with them. So again its not as quantitative as wed all like, but its qualitatively a pretty good indicator. David Wu - GC Research Ltd.  And approximately what percentage of your large customers are on hub at this point? Jerald G. Fishman I dont really have that statistic, David. I mean the ones that you know everybody has a hub with I expect we do, but I dont have that statistic handy. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Whalen Citi. Terence Whalen - Citi Jerry, I think in your concluding remarks you made several points and I was hoping to revisit a couple of these. I think a lot of the questions already have pertained to top line and gross margin. I was hoping to make this question about operating expenses. One of your first points was you said you were making changes that I think overall were intended to improve the customer facing experience. And then your second point pertained to fundamentally reducing infrastructure costs. I wanted to understand maybe two or three points specifically how you can balance those [explicit] goals of really improving the efficacy of your sales and distribution while reducing the cost of that. And the reason I ask the question is because I think as we see good sales growth, I think there might be some investment skepticism around the ability to really reign in the costs. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. Well, I guess the only way to prove that is to do it. But you know just conceptually the way were thinking about it is you know at Analog weve grown up as a product company over the years and as a result, you know, weve had a lot of different product groups all over the company that basically ran their businesses, did a very good job of doing that, and each of them was a relatively self contained business whose only goal was to grow and make money. You know, the change we made was basically to try to say that we have a business like that, but we dont need the level of decentralization in those businesses that weve had historically. And there are opportunities to get much greater benefit of scale, much greater sharing of technology, much less overhead costs in each of those businesses. And decentralizations a great thing in terms of getting focused but its a terrible thing in terms of cost.  So as you create more centralized ways of thinking about even the technology dimension of the company, I think there are great opportunities that weve seen and I think theres more to come in getting the infrastructure costs of the company down.  The other part of the mix there of creating these market facing groups is just a way of more efficiently dealing with customers. Again, when you have many, many product groups, you know I think at the peak we probably had 45 or 50 different product groups in the company, and every one of them was out there banging on the customers for their particular application or product. Its not a very efficient utilization of their time and its very inefficient for the customers and for our sales force to have to drag around 47 different product lines to these accounts. I think by a much more centralized look on a tactical basis we just save a lot of time and money in trying to deal with the largest customers. And we also can deal with them with the full breadth of ADIs technology. You know Id say lastly, and it might turn out to be of all these things the most important, is that we now can look at each of these market segments and set the priorities across the company rather than looking at 45 or 50 different product groups and try to set the priorities. And you know just in going through the 2010 planning process, you know, when were determined to keep the OpEx relatively flat and we have a lot of different people who have a lot of different ideas on what theyd like to do, just the strategic clarity that we can bring to bear on those decisions and the analysis that we can do of what were putting in and what were getting out of a particular market segment is much, much better, and has given us just a much clearer sense of where the moneys going, what the input/output ratio is in some of the things were doing, and therefore what are the investments that were going to continue to support, and what are the investments that were going to decrease our support in. It just is a much more efficient way of running the company. So I mean those things when you first look at them sound like they kind of balance each other. How can you, you know, drive more sales growth and get the costs down at the same time? But you know that is our job, to get good growth and to get the cost structure of the company down. And I think everybody around the company believes thats our job and were going to do that. And you know there are many skeptics out there about can you do that, but we understand that. But I think if usually the fourth quarter is a proxy for our determination on that, I think you can probably get a sense that were serious about that. Terence Whalen Citi  I think the follow up then is to Dave. Dave, I think in the past you talked about reaching a peak sales level, a prior peak sales level which was I think about $659 to $661 with about $200 to $210 million in OpEx. Now can you validate whether thats a reasonable modeling window. David A. Zinsner Well I think the way were thinking about it on OpEx as a target is really to target really in kind of the low $30s. Historically when were at kind of our higher peak levels of revenue, weve really been kind of in the mid-$30s. So we see trying to drive OpEx more into the low $30s as a percent of sales and couple that with a gross margin in the low $60s and I think you get a pretty good number for operating margins, well above kind of prior peaks. Operator Your next question comes from Steven Smigie - Raymond James. Steven Smigie - Raymond James I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the OpEx. Dave, I know you said I think dollar wise you expect only pretty modest increases going forward. Are there any you know short term cost reduction efforts you took during the downturn that have yet to come back into the numbers? David A. Zinsner Well weve taken a lot of actions up until this point to get the number to where it is. Were always looking to squeeze out efficiencies obviously, but the variable expense that could find its way back into the P&amp;L we think is essentially under our control. In fact most of it is variable comp thats tied to operating margins improving. So were in a situation now where we think the OpEx is in our control and we can kind of manage it effectively going forward really to drive to this kind of target, operating expense as a percent of sales. Jerald G. Fishman This is Jerry. That continues to pressurize us to keep looking at all the things were doing and prioritize. You know what were communicating around the company is that the worst thing we could do right now is you know sort of wipe our brows and say you know weve survived and everythings great, and now were back to doing it the way we used to do it. And you know we dont have to make hard choices any more. And the message that, you know, were communicating very candidly around the company is you know that process of continuing to see where the investments should go and prioritization and continuing to drive the costs down, those are not one time phenomena thats caused by, you know, the world falling apart last year. These are things that companies like ADI given the markets were in have to do every year. And thats what our plan is to do. Steven Smigie - Raymond James  And then just as a follow up, just for modeling purposes, would I expect then sequentially over the next few quarters percentage wise to see that keep trending down or could you have maybe one quarter where it pops up a little bit again? Jerald G. Fishman I mean, well have to see how the revenues go, but our sense is that that should keep trending down as a percentage of sales. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Dave, as we look at the gap between depreciation and CapEx, how much of that gap goes away as you get the two fabs shut down later this year? David A. Zinsner The two fabs are actually shut down, so we completed the last shutdown as of the end of this quarter. So as far as depreciation expense next quarter we wont have the Cambridge depreciation expense, although it was only I think $2 million a quarter. Really what will drive depreciation down further from here really is a function of the fact that were just spending less in capital. Now that is a function obviously of having two less fabs than we had a year ago. Jerald G. Fishman And less capacity. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company  And then as a follow up, just on one of the product areas, looking at power management it popped up, obviously still one of the smaller businesses but in the 28% sequential growth is that all just seasonality? Or are you starting to get some traction on some of the design activity that the companys been working on to try and grow that business organically? Jerald G. Fishman I think we are getting some good design traction and there was some seasonality in that number. So I think its both, but theres no doubt we, after a lot of investment, are beginning to get some traction on that business. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company  And in the past year youve talked about I think potential design wins in base stations and other, more traditional ADI type applications. Is that where youre seeing that happen? Jerald G. Fishman Oh, were seeing it happen across a wide spectrum of markets, those being one of them. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein First just to revisit the OpEx again, so OpEx this quarter was up $5 million. I know before you had about $20 million in temporary savings. So does this imply that all the permanent savings were there, you got $5 million back of the temporary or were there more permanent savings that also happened this quarter? Id also like to see if you could give me some feeling of what revenue level youd expect all temporary cuts to actually be back into the operating model. David A. Zinsner So as I talked about in the prepared comments, the $5 million increase was all as a result of variable comp coming back. So in a sense that was temporary cost savings when operating margins have declined a lot and now thats phased back in. Theres obviously always some amount of infrastructure related reductions that are phasing into our P&amp;L as well. You know it was in kind of that million-ish kind of range, the $2 million range this quarter. So it wasnt a lot of savings that flowed back into the P&amp;L in the fourth quarter. As far as when we get back to our kind of peak revenue levels and all our temporary reductions are back in, again I point again to our target. Our targets to get kind of the low $30s in operating expenses and this obviously as Jerry mentioned requires some rolling up our sleeves, but we feel like we have a good track to get there.  Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  And for my follow up Id like to see if we could visit the fab consolidations. So the last time I think you closed a fab was in Sunnyvale a couple of years ago, where you were targeting about $40 million or so in annualized savings. And when that was done you never really actually did seem to see those levels of savings realized in the form of structurally higher gross margins. Im actually wondering is there anything different from the current fab consolidations versus Sunnyvale? If you could just kind of walk me through maybe where I guess the savings from the last one went and what might be different this time. Jerald G. Fishman Well, you know, theres a whole bunch of effects that happen when you close a fab. And you know it turned out right after we closed that fab of course business went down quite a bit. And where you really see the benefits of that is you know when you can load up your other fabs and you get rid of some structural costs. I think the difference is this time we have taken a real large slug of capacity out. These were fabs that had a lot more expense than the Sunnyvale fab which was a relatively low cost fab. And were already seeing the benefits of that as you know weve come into these consolidations at the right time in the cycle where were going to start increasing utilization.  So if we didnt think that we could get all the benefits of these fab closures or many of the benefits, I think we wouldnt be saying that we think we can get the gross margins up above 60% because there would be no way to do that. So I think our sense of where, as weve gone through all the details of the cost savings, how its going to play out for the next couple of quarters under the assumption that, you know, the world doesnt collapse on us, we have a pretty good bead on. And those analyses indicate the kind of gross margins that Dave has been talking about. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  But the Sunnyvale actually wasnt that small in terms of the cost, right? I mean I think youd said you were targeting $40 million then. Its $65 million this time so its not that different. Jerald G. Fishman So Im not sure what the question is. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  Like you said you thought this time the cost savings were much bigger than Sunnyvale and you were sort of offering that up as one reason along with I suppose the business falling off with Sunnyvale is one reason why those were never realized. But I would think even if the business was falling off, most of that $40 million as far as I know was supposed to be labor related, so I would have expected to see in [inaudible] higher margins even then. Jerald G. Fishman No, most of the $40 is not labor related. Theres a lot of equipment you take off line, theres a lot of, you know, generally in a fab about a third of the costs are labor and a third of the costs are overhead and a third of the costs are all the other direct costs of running the fab. So you know everyone should look at it the way theyre comfortable looking at it, but what I would look for is what happens with the gross margins. And if the gross margins go the way that Dave and I have been planning and talking about, then we will have gotten very substantial savings in these fab closures. And if it turns out that theyre not, either something went wrong pretty significantly or you know these are all illusory and you dont get any savings when you close a fab. My guess is when history is written, and you know the reason that were comfortable enough to talk about these kind of levels is you know weve gone through a tremendous amount of detailed planning and those are the numbers that come out of this plan. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  So out of the $65 million from these minus then was the $5 million was depreciation and the rest was other stuff, labor and operating expenses. Is that true? David A. Zinsner No, I think it was about $14 million that was depreciation of $65 million. Operator Your next question comes from Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch I had a couple questions, the consumer business doing particularly well. Its at a quarterly run rate now thats not too far from the peak you registered before the downturn started. Can you help us quantify whats really helping with the consumer MEMs design win, a big driver, and have you maxed out that opportunity or is there more to go there? Jerald G. Fishman   Well it was really a combination of things. You know the more standard, traditional consumer areas in cameras and other connectivity parts of the consumer business did very well. You know we do have some good design wins in the MEMs consumer area that ramped up last quarter. You know we think theres a lot of potential for that going forward. So I think its really a combination of all those things that led to that growth. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch  And then on the Limerick facility, you know, you mentioned $5 to $7 million in benefits from savings in fiscal Q1 so when you annualize that number thats $20 to $28 million, so right in line with the $25 million you talked about, Dave. I guess my question is, is there more to come from that facility as you look into fiscal Q2? And if so, does that imply that the benefits from that restructuring are tracking ahead of what youd initially anticipated? David A. Zinsner Let me be clear. The $5 million of savings well see in Q1 is really associated with the Limerick consolidation, which is about a $40 million annualized savings. So were getting about half a quarters worth of savings on the Limerick consolidation in Q1. The Cambridge one just closed at the end of the fiscal year, so it takes a little while to digest the older inventory at the higher cost, so I wouldnt expect us to see any savings there until the back half of the year. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch  And that would be the $25 million? David A. Zinsner That would be the $25 million of annualized savings, yes. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch And then the last question I have is for you, Jerry. On the auto business, two straight quarters of very good growth, I think you said 37% in the October quarter, but entering the quarter you hadnt anticipated a pick up after the strong growth youd seen in July. You know, do you have any sense of whether this is, I know youre guiding this business flat, but given that youre back to a peak run rate do you think weve over stretched in terms of the recovery in that business? Or do you think theres organic growth left to be had in that business into 2010? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think one of the reasons were optimistic about that business in 2010 is the product cycle were in in that business. You know weve put a fair amount of money in R&amp;D into that. I mentioned some of the product areas in my opening remarks that were having great success in. So I think, you know, if we were just thinking of the base line, you know given that you know all the clunker programs have sort of wound down, wed be more circumspect about the auto business next quarter or two. But our [inaudible] a very rich new product cycle in the auto business, which will counteract what probably were some one time events that went on in the automotive business in the last quarter or two. Operator Your next question comes from [Moniche Goyle] Crest Investment. [Moniche Goyle] Crest Investment Im curious about how to think about stock buyback in 2010. Jerald G. Fishman Well well have to just wait and see. You know we historically have had, you know, fairly aggressive buyback in different programs where we went out and started to accumulate a little more cash and a little more confident. We still dont have a lot of cash in the U.S. but anyhow well have to wait and see how that goes in conversations with our board. [Moniche Goyle] Crest Investment So Jerry just if you can explain, what are the factors and considerations for having a buyback program? Jerald G. Fishman Well, it has a lot to do with just where our cash is, you know, which is still predominantly overseas, and our expectations about whats going to happen with the tax regulations relative to that going forward. And also our perspective where the business is headed and what the distribution of the cash were going to generate is likely to be for the year. So we review that with the board once a quarter and were going to review that with them again this quarter at our board meeting. And then well get a consolidated view of heres whats likely to happen and well decide what to do. Operator Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech Is it possible for you guys to remind me when your annual and promotion costs kick in? Jerald G. Fishman Typically they kick in in our second quarter, but we havent decided what were doing about that this year yet. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech  And then, Jerry, just in a little bit bigger picture looking at you know your fab situation utilization arent really that different from others across the analog industry. And we hear from most companies utilizations 50, 60% level. Now that demand sort of seems to be more normalized, if thats a fair statement, you know I believe theres a good risk investors are [audio impairment] about the risk that we see increased [audio impairment] pressure. Can you comment on what you guys are seeing? Why you dont think, when demand comes back, you dont see this pressure to take on that mentality of fill the fab? And Ill have a follow up to that. Jerald G. Fishman Well I think for us who have been in the high end of the analog business, the real key is that so much of the product portfolio is not directly [copyable] I would say, so you know we didnt see a lot of pressure on the ASPs when business got poor. And even though most people are [audio impairment] loaded, you know the product [audio impairment] that we compete in with most of the high end analog companies are not those that we primarily compete on price on. So you know weve been through a lot of these cycles and we typically on the upside or the downside dont see a lot of price pressure. You know we of course have prices that are lower on the existing products each year than the year before. Thats very natural, particularly for larger customers.  But on the other hand you know our job is to come up with very innovative products where you dont have a lot of competition and where even though, you know, that our job really is to create solutions for customers that are great value without reducing the price. So I dont think thats going to change very much. We dont see movement on the ASPs very much in aggregate through the company in any of these cycles. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech  That leads me into sort of volume pricing agreements that tend to be in the communications end market. Were sort of at the point and time of year where those volume pricing agreements sort of get set and awards are offered. Any commentary on what type of year-over-year ASP erosion you saw on those? Jerald G. Fishman Well again, we tend to supply more and more integrated solutions to the customer base youre talking about so I mean I couldnt quote you a specific number. I mean when youre selling the same product as you sold last year, theres always price pressure, particularly in certain regions of the world. What weve got to do is A, weve got to continue the innovation thing and secondly, weve got to make sure our costs are going down faster than the prices are going down. And thats what weve been doing for many years and I think thats what we have to continue to do. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech  If we look at the coms market, it was really one of the better performing segments throughout the year. Have any of your communications customers given you an idea of what sort of their capital budgets are going to be for 2010, whether were going to see follow through and that segment sort of out performing? Jerald G. Fishman Well, from the conversations that weve had with the largest infrastructure customers, you know, in Europe, to some degree in the U.S. and certainly in China, you know Id say the feedback we get is theyre expecting 2010 to be a good year. You know its lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but I think in aggregate theyre enthusiastic about their prospects for the year and thats the sentiment theyve communicated to us. Mindy Kohl  Okay. Well, we appreciate your participation today and look forward to talking with all of you again during our first quarter 2010 conference call, scheduled for February 17, 2010. Thanks very much.

F2Q09 Earnings Call May 19, 2009 5:00 PM ETOperator At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices fiscal second quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Miss Kohl, you may begin your conference. Mindy Kohl Good afternoon everyone. This is Mindy Kohl, Director of Investor Relations for Analog Devices. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you have not yet seen our second quarter fiscal 2009 release, you can access it by visiting our website at www.analog.com and clicking on the headline on the home page. This conference call is also being broadcast live on the Internet. From analog.com, select Investor Relations and follow the instructions shown next to the microphone icon. A recording of this call will be available today within about two hours of the calls completion and will remain available via phone and Internet playback for one week. This webcast will also be archived on our IR website.  Participating in todays call are Jerry Fishman, President and CEO, and Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part of the call Jerry and Dave will present our second quarter results and our short-term outlook and then we will open it up for questions.   During todays call, we will refer to several non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for one-time items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in todays earnings release, which is now posted on the IR website. Weve also updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;Ls for continuing operations as well as historical quarterly and annual information for product revenue from continuing operations by end market and by product type.  Next, Id ask you to please note that the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which include risks and uncertainties. The companys actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in the companys SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this afternoon. The forward-looking information that is provided by the company in this call represents the companys outlook as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause the companys outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is May 19, 2009. With that, Ill turn the call over to Jerry for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us on today's call. As you can see from the press release we put out this afternoon and also our 10-Q, our Q2 revenues and profits were both well above the expectations that we communicated last quarter, as business levels stabilized and our cost reduction actions were more aggressive than originally thought in response to continuing economic uncertainty that still exists today. Revenues for our second quarter were approximately flat to Q1 levels and earnings per share increased sequentially by 17% excluding restructuring charges. On a sequential basis operating expenses, also excluding restructuring charges, declined by 8% sequentially and are now down 20%, or $48.0 million in total, over the past two quarters. Although the economic environment remains very challenging, we are encouraged by the continuing stability of our bookings activity over the past three months. We have also been given the very general sense from many of our customers that their incoming business levels have stabilized and their inventories have now reached satisfactory levels after two quarters of, in some cases, very significant declines. For the second quarter our revenues were $475.0 million, which was down 27% from the prior year and about flat to last quarter. In aggregate, our revenues grew sequentially in communications infrastructure and also in consumer products. However, our revenues continue to decline, albeit at a much reduced rate, in the industrial markets as capital spending worldwide remained depressed and our industrial customers have remained cautious. In line with these market trends, revenues increased sequentially in Asia and declined sequentially in Europe and North America, both of which are more dependent on industrial capital spending. Revenues for our very broad base of industrial customers, which were 52% of our revenues in Q2, were down 31% year-over-year and also down about 5% sequentially. Revenues from factory automation, instrumentation, and healthcare customers declined slightly from the prior quarter and while we don't expect much further erosion, we've not yet really seen any meaningful momentum in these markets. Not surprisingly, the automotive market remained troubled and our revenues from the automotive market were down 38% from the prior year, although we did see a small sequential increase as European automakers returned to production after numerous inventory reducing shut downs during the prior quarter. While automotive customers worldwide are plagued by very weak unit sales, their reliance on electronics to quickly bring differentiated features to the market continues to drive up vehicle signal processing content. So this bodes well for ADI when this industry does eventually regain some momentum. As was the case in the first quarter, in a few industrial markets, our revenue declines have been less severe. Revenues from defense customers were down only a small amount and products that sell into industrial infrastructure, such as security systems and energy management systemsand that's true particularly in Chinawere again much less affected than in the U.S. and in Europe. Despite the current weakness for our industrial customers we continue to be very enthusiastic about the mid- to long-term potential for ADI in the industrial markets for three important reasons. Number one, our sales to industrial customers over the past two quarters have declined at a significantly higher rate than industrial production has declined in the U.S. and Europe, which generally drives this business. Specifically, industrial production and output, which is often a very good leading indicator of industrial capital spending, declined approximately 9% over the last six months, while our sales to industrial customers from ADI declined 28% during the same period. This implies that we have absorbed the very significant inventory correction and that our sales to industrial customers have been well below their consumption rate of our products. Therefore, even if capital spending stays at depressed levels it would be logical to assume that our sales to industrial customers have reached, or will soon reach or approach, trough levels and will recover very quickly when capital spending begins to improve. Secondly, we have seen an increase in our industrial sales in China, in line with the government's industrial stimulus spending and that is likely to continue or perhaps even accelerate in the future. And lastly, our industrial customers buy our highest-performance converters and amplifiers as well as many ASSPs and our competitive position and our share continue to strengthen in many of these product categories. In fact, the most recent data that was published just recently in the last couple of weeks, I believe, by the Gartner Group, indicates that our converter market share increased to 40% in 2008, up from 37% the year before. We are also seeing very good design activity and good design wins across all the industrial markets we serve, which could accelerate our sales rebound when our customers' confidence improves in the United States and Europe. In the second quarter revenues from our communications customers were 29% of our revenues, down 7% from last year but up 8% to 10% sequentially. The recovery of the communications infrastructure market was driven in large part by China rewarding 3G licenses in January.  ADI is very well positioned across many customers, many standards, and of course many geographies, to take advantage of the upside from the China 3G roll outs as well as continued 2G expansion in emerging markets and upcoming 4G infrastructure build outs in the future. Design activity remains very strong with these customers as we expand the builder materials presence we have to a much broader section of products and that should continue to improve our long-term market share in this market as we emerge from the downturn. We also saw an increase in our wireless handset business in Q2, which has become right now a relatively small part of our overall communications business as we have now focused our investments primarily on analog products and higher-end phones. We believe the handset business, which was down significantly in the first quarter, most likely has adjusted production levels to be more in line now with end demand. Revenues from the consumer end market was 17% of our total revenues, down 36% from last year but up 5% sequentially, primarily due to increased sales of products like digital cameras, after very significant declines in our first quarter. Although the consumer market of course continues to be weak, here again the second quarter saw a modest increase in sales as many customers began to better align their production with end demand and stocked with a relentless declines in their inventories. Revenues from our computer customers, which comprised only 3% of our revenues, declined 44% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. As you might remember, we have mentioned previously that we have significantly reduced our investment in ASS products for computers, given what we see as a very limited opportunity for high-performance signal processing technology in the personal computer market. So now I will turn the call over to Dave, who is going to review in a little more detail on the financial results for Q2. David A. Zinsner I will start with gross margins. In Q2 gross margins were 55.1%, above plan for the quarter. Gross margins were down 590 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially, primarily a result of utilization rates of approximately 40% in our internal fabs as we further reduced inventories. As a result of lower utilization, inventories declined $16.0 million sequentially and days in inventory declined from 141 days to 130 days. These results were achieved despite a $7.0 million inventory build related to our ongoing fab consolidations and a further meaningful drop in distribution inventory.  Moving forward, we're still on track to complete our fab consolidations by the end of this fiscal year, which in aggregate should lead to an annualized decrease in cost of sales from current levels of approximately $65.0 million by the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We should begin to see the impact of these cost reductions in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 with the full savings benefits realized by the third quarter of fiscal 2010. In the second quarter operating expenses, excluding restructuring, were $192.0 million, down 8% from the prior quarter. In total, operating expenses were down $48.0 million, or 20%, from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Approximately 40%, or $20.0 million, of the $48.0 million drop is of a temporary nature. It is mainly related to a drop in variable compensation and forced time off. The remaining 60% of the savings are permanent reductions in labor and related expenses and reductions in discretionary expenses. Our goal is to retain a large portion of the saving in discretionary spending as revenues grow. We are also planning additional savings from actions already taken but for which the benefits have not yet been realized, as well as from future infrastructure cost reductions throughout the company. In Q2 operating income, excluding restructuring charges, increased 14% from the prior quarter to $70.0 million as operating expense management more than offset slightly lower gross margins on flat sales. Excluding restructuring charges, diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.21, up 17% from the prior quarter. Higher operating income and a better than planned tax rate of 18.8% drove higher net income. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was $76.0 million and capital expenditures were $12.0 million. Because our current level of internal capacity can support more than twice our current revenue level, we have significantly reduced capital spending plans for the year, down from $157.0 million last year to an expected $60.0 million in 2009, the bulk of which is tied to our fab consolidations. We believe that in future years our capital spending will be at similar levels to 2009. As a result, over time our annual depreciation, which was $144.0 million in fiscal 2008, should begin to move closer to our expected $60.0 million capital spending rate. Since most of our capital spending is manufacturing-related, this should be accretive to our gross margins. Accounts receivable decreased slightly from last quarter. DSO decreased to 44 days and 100% of our customers are current to terms. These are impressive results, particularly in the context of the current credit environment. During Q2 we paid out $58.0 million in dividends and this quarter our board once again approved a $0.20 per share quarterly cash dividend. At current prices, our dividend yield is approximately 4%. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and no debt. Although much of our cash is overseas, we continue to believe that our dividend is an important mechanism for returning value to our shareholders. We expect U.S. cash flow to increase when industrial revenues recover and as we realize the benefits of the Massachusetts fab consolidation. This consolidation should result in significantly increased U.S. profits and lower capital spending. Even during this difficult economic cycle, our business continues to generate strong cash flow, as it has done for many years. We believe that as economic conditions improve, demand recovers, and we fully realize the benefits of our fundamentally lower cost structure, our cash flow will significantly increase as will our earnings leverage. With that, I will turn the call back to Jerry. Jerald G. Fishman The orders to ADI and to our distributors recovered significantly in Q2 as customer inventory reductions abated. Our book-to-bill ratio for Q2, as measured by end customer bookings, was slightly above one for the first time since Q3 of 2008, and our Q3 opening backlog was up from last quarter.  In addition, order levels were stable throughout the second quarter and have remained at these levels through the first two weeks in May. Nevertheless, lead times are short and we are still receiving a significant portion of new orders as turns orders, which gives us, of course, very limited visibility. So given all these factors, were planning for our third quarter revenues to be approximately flat on a sequential basis. We plan to continue to reduce inventories in Q3, and keep very tight control over operating costs.  As a result, we expect gross margins to be in the 54% to 55% region and that will, of course, depend on the actual mix of business we ship and what ultimately we decide to be the appropriate factory utilization through the quarter. Overall, pricing for our products remains stable. We are planning for the operating expenses in Q2 to remain approximately flat sequentially and of course, to gain significant operating leverage when growth does resume. And as Dave mentioned, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the balance of the year.  As a result of all those things, we are planning for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19 in Q3. So before we open up the call for questions, I just wanted to close with a few key points. Obviously in the last six months it's been a difficult environment in which to operate a company, particularly companies like semi-conductor companies that have large portion of the cost as fixed cost.  However, ADI's business model has allowed us to remain solidly profitable and continue to generate positive cash flow, despite the substantial short-term revenue declines that are the result of the economic chaos that's out there. Today our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry and are one of the very few companies that we compete with that has no net debt, as well as the opportunity for significant operating leverage as revenues increase. This leverage will be driven by our much richer product mix, which is the result of having refocused ADI on more profitable and sustainable products and markets over the past 18 months and a fundamentally lower expense structure, the result of actions that we have taken to permanently reduce our infrastructure costs. All these actions are designed to set us back on course towards our long-term model of 30% operating margins, which we now expect to achieve at lower revenue levels than we previously expected. Our strategic investment priorities within the company are now very well defined and our current portfolio and our competitive position are about the strongest they have been in many years.  Very importantly, our customers continue to view ADI as a technology leader, a reliable and trustworthy partner, and a financially stable supplier in a very chaotic environment. Our employees around the world understand where we are headed and despite all the pain of the last few quarters, I believe we are as committed as ever to ADI remaining one of the best technologies companies around. And I think all of that bodes very well for earnings growth and improved shareholder returns as the economy recovers. Mindy Kohl During today's Q&amp;A period we ask you to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up question and we will do our best to give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining.   Question-and-Answer Session  Operator  Your first question comes from Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities Just a question on the inventory commentary, you mentioned that you expect to bring down your own inventory in the next quarter. You did see inventory drop substantially. What are your plans in that and what should we imply about your utilization going into the next quarter? Jerald G. Fishman I think in general, it's always hard to say what the distis are going to do with their inventory in advance, but I think our utilization is going to probably be very similar to what it was this quarter. We still have pretty healthy inventories and we are going to try to get them down to give us the maximum upside leverage when business gets better. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities On the opex side of things, how long should we think about you being able to keep the opex at roughly under $200.0 million or if you wanted to add that $20.0 million that was temporary to the number, how should we think about opex growing versus revenues? David A. Zinsner First, I think it's important to note that that 20% that is temporary, a lot of that is highly contingent on actually profits increasing, so there is a sustainability to it that is pretty good if the business doesn't improve. Having said that, our goal is really, as we look at different revenue levels, take for example $550.0 million in revenue, as we get to that level, the last time we were at that revenue level our operating margins were kind of in the 20% range. Our goal is to get meaningfully about that and that's kind of how we're looking at opex. So opex, to some extent, is dependent on kind of timing and where we are making our investments and where the revenue is being generated, but I think it's safe to assume that our goal is really to expand operating margins, much beyond where we were the last time revenue was going up. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities The $48.0 million you said you cut in opex, was the percent, 20% of that was temporary or was $20.0 million out of the $48.0 million? David A. Zinsner About 40% of the $48.0 million was temporary. I think I said 20%, I meant 40%. And that roughly equates to the $20.0 million of temporary. But most of it is variable comp, which is highly dependent on how our operating margins do over time. Jerald G. Fishman I think there is very little doubt that any increase to opex is going to be very carefully controlled, no matter what happens on the upside. And we are certainly going to grow the revenues at quite a bit above any increase in opex. As we said earlier, I think in Dave's comments, we still haven't even really realized all the savings for actions we've already taken. As they come in over the next couple of quarters, on both the opex line and the cost of goods line. So, I think we have a lot of downward cost pressure in the company and the main reason is we expect to get to higher margins at lower revenues than we did last time and that's sort of the mantra around the company. Operator Your next question comes from John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company. John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company Jerry, you went through a bunch of details of the industrial end market and basically highlighting the fact that your sales in the end market have contracted much more than the actual industrial market itself. You then kind of went on to say that they are getting near trough inventories. And then you went on to say that you are poised to really bounce back when industrial spending comes back. If I'm not misinterpreting your statements, you are chipping into the industrial market at a fair rate below what they are truly consuming at today, even without a bounce back in spending. And if that assertion is correct, doesn't that mean that your sales could bounce back even before true industrial spending starts to recover? Jerald G. Fishman It's always hard to be precise when you are talking about a business with tens of thousands of customers in every geography. I think what I was trying to communicate is while that's possible, if you want to be pessimistic about the world, which we all tend to be right now, or cautious, we are saying that at least the rate of decline certainly abated last quarter.  I believe we are reaching the trough in these businesses, given the disconnect between what's happened in the markets and what's happened with our sales and all our competitors' sales in the industrial market. So there's not a lot more downside, I think, and for a lot of reasons, including the ones that you mentioned, there might be some upside, but it's too early to be optimistic about that. At least in the very short term. You know, we would like to see a real fundamental change in the momentum in the market before we really declare that that's going to get better. And you know, there are machinations going on about inventory going up and inventory going down but eventually there is going to be demand getting better and that's the time when you'll really see that business getting better. So my comments, in the summary, on the industrial market were more about given the fact that the inventories are ahead of what's going on in the market, it's at least unlikely that it's not going to go down anymore and maybe with the margin there will be a little bounce or something because of the abatement of the inventory reductions. But it's hard to tell. John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company Comm infrastructure and market, what are your thoughts on that as you look out over the next several months and quarters and obviously it's starting to bounce back. Do you think that can continue consistently or how do you view that? Jerald G. Fishman Your question is about the communications infrastructure? John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company That's correct. Jerald G. Fishman Well, clearly, it's been explosive in China. That's been well described by us and I believe many of our competitors and other people that participate in that market. You know, there are concerns out in the market that there is going to be a pause in China while they absorb all the stuff, but it's hard to predict that far in advance. I think in the long term in China there is going to be a huge build out that's going to continue. Whether there is a pause in that market in the short term, for a quarter, or maybe a little bit longer, it's very hard to predict. I think the infrastructure part of the market, outside of China, is probably more predictable than in China right now. And if you look at the large infrastructure providers in Europe and the United States, they are still blessed and headed pretty well. So the uncertainty over the next quarter or two is probably in the Chinese infrastructure market and there's a lot of different opinions of what might happen there in the short term. But I would say very few different opinions of what's going to happen in that market over the longer term. Operator Your next question comes from Steven Smigie - Raymond James. Steven Smigie - Raymond James I was wondering if you could comment a little on how much inventory you're thinking about taking out of the channel and internally here and what gross margin might have looked like if you weren't taking that out? David A. Zinsner Our goal really is to get our inventory down to in the 110 days on our balance sheet. As we look at inventory, you never know, but it's pretty close to where I would consider historical levels have been. Maybe it comes down a little bit more but not much more. It's tough to say on utilization. Obviously when we were a relatively utilized business model we were running at 61% gross margins, we got a couple of things going in our favor now coming into the next cycle. Our Limerick consolidation is now pretty much complete and we will start seeing the savings at the beginning of next year. We have the Cambridge consolidation going on right now. That will be complete by the end of this fiscal year and we're expecting to see savings middle of next year. So there's at least a couple of hundred basis points of improvement from those consolidations and as the revenue starts to pick back up we will start to see gross margin expansion, just from the absorption side of things. So our goal is really to see if we were at 61% back at the last peak, that if we get up to those revenue levels at some point, that we're at least a couple of hundred basis points about that. Steven Smigie - Raymond James That was definitely a question I was looking for an answer to but I also mean specifically in this quarter, if you weren't doing inventory reductions this quarter. David A. Zinsner It's difficult to say. I couldn't even ballpark it. Jerald G. Fishman I think it's probably fair to say that the lion's share of the declines that we have seen in the gross margin from the peak are about utilizations. So I mean there's nothing else going on with the mix that's very substantial. If anything, the industrial mix is down quite a bit, which is really whacked the utilization hardest and throws the most of the products from builders so, I think the real take away is that there is a lot of gross margin leverage in the system here and we are not planning yet in Q3 to turn out production because we're trying to work inventory down a bit. We'll have to take another look at that at the end of third quarter, decide what we do, and fourth quarter and for the balance of the year. And that will really determine, in the short term, what happens with gross margins. Steven Smigie - Raymond James And following up, drawing a conclusion from your comments there about what gross margin looks like several quarters out, I know you mentioned you were looking to hit that 30% operating margin on lower revenues, but presumably that operating margin will be quite a bit above 30%, as a few years out also, so basically is there some time maybe in the next quarter or two where you would come out with a new operating model? Jerald G. Fishman I would say once the business starts considerably moving up and there is real demand behind that as compared to supply issues, which are mostly driving the cycle right now, I think we are working on that very hard, we have a lot of ideas on what that is and how to get there clearly. Some of the actions we have taken are behind that new model. But I think it's a little premature to communicate a new model when we're running below 15% and the goal is 30%. As we start marching towards that goal, we will have a lot of updates on a different model above that. But I think for now I would try to keep the focus on let's keep moving it up, let's build in a lot of leverage as the sales grow, let's keep raising that every quarter in terms of the margins, as business gets better, and then we'll take a look at what the long-term model is as we start moving towards that objective. Operator Your next question comes from Uche Orji UBS. Uche Orji UBS Jerry, can I just ask you about some clarification as to one of the things you said in your closing remarks. You talked about the revenue level you need to achieve your 30% target model being less now than what you had expected. Are you able to give us some idea as to what those numbers are in terms of what expectation was before and what it is now? Jerald G. Fishman I'm not going to try to provide specificity on that right now. We're too far away from it. But I would say generically we got up to 25% or 26% at 650, which was the peak quarter. I guess that was Q4 of last year, and that we think we can do a lot better than that at lower revenue levels but I think it's premature to pick a revenue level and say at that revenue level we'll have this margin. I think we would like another quarter or so to see how the business unfolds and then we will give you a little more guidance on that in the future. Uche Orji UBS If I look at the guidance you've given to next quarter, do you mean that the end revenue mix should be similar to the quarter just ended, and if not, where do you think is and based on what you've seen so far should we expect to see the most surprise on the upside or the downside? Jerald G. Fishman That revenue target that we put out about flat, there's obviously pluses and minuses to that that are possible. It's very hard to be precise when most of it is turns business and the market is very volatile right now. So what we really communicated was the plan we're going to run the company at. I think it's important to say that that the expense levels and the way we're going to run the factories is going to be somewhat independent of what the revenue levels are for the next quarter.  So I think as we generically think about the whole question of the expense levels and the revenue levels associated with that, it seems to me the upside is probably that the inventory declines in the industrial business might continue to abate and that might give us a little more upside. We're expecting the consumer market to be a little bit better than it was seasonally because that typically is what happens.  On the risk side, we have the month of July, which is a great unknown and nobody can really predict what's going to happen in July. In typical years July is usually a weak month but lately there is no typical year because there are so many different things going on. And of course, there is risk in the infrastructure part of the business in China. So when we look at the pluses and minuses, our product groups, when they looked at all the details of that, came up with a number plus or minus a little bit that it's roughly flat. But how it actually turns out, I think we'll have to wait until the end of the third quarter to see. Uche Orji UBS Jerry, can you just tell us now about what your priorities are beyond taking inventory down and taking cost on the product side. Are there areas where you think that you need some more specificity on management and maps, [inaudible]. Jerald G. Fishman I'm not sure I understood your question. Did you ask what our strategic priorities are for the MEMS and the power business? Uche Orji UBS Yes. Jerald G. Fishman I think as we said before, they have both been strategic priorities for the company, each for different reasons. On the power side we have said that because it really is the one category in the analog business that we haven't had much sales and our customers really want us to be, as they continue to contract the amount of vendors, they want to do business and we've put a lot of money into that business. And as I mentioned, I think last quarter, despite all the economic chaos, it looks like we're really beginning to get some traction on some products and some customers in that business. It's been a long haul but we are. The MEMS business is a little bit different. The real strategic rationale for that business is that of course there's a lot of customers that have a lot of applications in MEMS. Increasingly that requires signal processing so it's a great addendum to things we already do.  But another important rationale to that is that it's hard to do and not many people can do it. It takes 15 years to figure out how to do it and it really does give us a real technology that it's not likely that we're going to have a lot of competition in, particularly amongst our traditional competitors. So it really, in a lot of applications, particularly automotive applications, but increasingly in industrial and other applications. I mean, it's just a tremendous building enthusiasm for things that can sense motion.  And it started out with accelerometers for cars, it's now moving into gyroscopes for cars and many other applications and behind every electronic stability control system, which is mandated pretty soon, there are going to be gyroscopes. And they are hard to do, believe me. It's taken us years to figure out how to do it.  So I think it's a compelling technology, we believe it's hard to replicate, we believe it goes hand in hand with many other technologies that we have in the company, be they analog or DSP light technologies. And the customersthis is one of the businesses where the customers really drag us into it because it really does change the end product if you can figure out to reliably and cost-effectively sense motion. In many different dimensions. So that's the rationale for each of those businesses. I think they both remain strategic priorities in the company and we're working to get more revenues and less cost, as we always are, like in every business, but they are important priorities for us. Operator Your next question comes from Jim Covello Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs First question, within the consumer segment, I think you commented the digital still camera was strong. Could you talk about the trends in the other two key segments within the consumer? I think that's digital TV and gaming. Jerald G. Fishman The digital TV market took a little pause out there, a large pause. That's been a very weak market over the last two quarters. Our internal forecasts indicate that that's going to get a little better this quarter. Time will tell if that really comes true.  The AV market has also been extremely weak. If we believe the forecast we're getting from some of those customers, at least on a seasonal basis, they're expecting some recovery. So we'll have to wait and see how that happens. Typically about third quarter we begin to see the build-up of that business and if this year turns out to be like other years, we should see some increase in that business next quarter.  But I think it would be very premature to say that the consumer market has turned and everything is going to go great. I think until the unemployment rate starts to abate we're not going to see big bulges in consumer spending. Or at least that's the theory under which we're running our company. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Relative to the turns business that you're assuming this quarter versus historically that you normally see in this quarter, about the same, little more conservative? David A. Zinsner It's relatively similar to historical levels. Last quarter obviously we did better and we had higher turns than we historically have, but the turns that we're building into our guidance this time around are pretty close to what the historical levels are. Jerald G. Fishman It's basically all turns. Nobody wants to hold inventory, nobody wants to give you any lead time. So I think that's the way the environment is going to stay for a while, at least for companies like ours. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Do you consider the ISM index a decent proxy for your overall industrial business? I know there's a lot of components to it but do you think that's a fair way to think about it? Jerald G. Fishman Yes, I would say that there are certainly trends that, with some lag or lead, tend to line up. And we look at that very closely and we have been encouraged by what we've seen over the last month or so, so time will tell. I think there's no doubt there's a correlation between those two, the question is the lag of that correlation to our business. But certainly when you see that starting to move up, that can't be viewed as a bad sign. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse David, I think that despite the inventory draw down in the April quarter there were still $7.0 million of buffer inventory you built for the upcoming fab closure. Is that something that will reoccur this quarter and how much excess inventory, or buffer inventory, should we think about relative to the fab consolidation? David A. Zinsner It is something for Cambridge that is likely to be repeated all the way up until we close Cambridge, which is at the end of the year. It's probably adding about 10 days to our inventory, the buffer builds. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse And Jerry, help me understand the upside in the April quarter relative to the down 10% mid-point guidance. What really drove that? Was it industrial mopping as that as you had first feared, was it the communications being stronger than expected? Just help me understand within the April quarter what drove the better than expected results in the top line. Jerald G. Fishman I think the answer to that is yes. The industrial business was a real collision course with Earth when we reported the numbers and we had really no understanding of where that was headed. The infrastructure business did a little bit better than we would have thought. Even the consumer business did a little better than we feared, I would say. So I think just generally, the amount of inventory that customers were getting rid of just abated at a faster rate than we feared and that gave us some upside. You know the 27% down year-over-year is not a great quarter, it just isn't as bad as we feared, which is really the way to think about it. And I think it was in those areas where we did a little bit better. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse The power management market, given that is a much more fragmented market than the converter market, can you help me understand the margin profile you are targeting in that market. And you mad the comment that your customers are pulling you into that business. What do they see that you have that they can't get elsewhere? Jerald G. Fishman In some of the more commodity power management areas where it's just really providing the function and five different people can do it and so on. We have gravitated a large part of the R&amp;D away from that part of the power business, but we see tremendous opportunity in others in the commodity part of the power business, in industrial products, in infrastructure products, and even in some of the consumer products where we can really do things in terms of integrating power with signal processing that is very hard for other, more power management-centric companies. So the very fragmentation that you mentioned of the power business is what gives us a good chance to actually get some meaningful revenues and make attractive margins in that business. I think if we stay out of the commodity parts of the power management business and focus on the areas that I mentioned, I don't think there is much of a difference in the gross margins we can achieve for other products that we sell into those particular markets. Operator Your next question comes from Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan. Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan Just a quick clarification. If you look at end markets within the flat guidance it sounds like you think that [inaudible] PC end markets will be up and the communication and industrial end markets will be down. Is that what we should imply? Jerald G. Fishman They are verythere is a fragmented answer to that question. I think there are some elements of each of those markets that you are saying will be down that really we are not planning for them to be down. There's part of the communications market whichthe Chinese infrastructure marketthat we will have to see how that goes. The rest of the infrastructure market I think remains pretty strong, as we see it. Many of the other communications applications, some of the networking stuff, some of the optical stuff, maybe even the handset stuff, might actually turn out to be a little bit better next quarter. We expect the consumer market to be a little bit better. One of the major concerns is just what happens in the month of July overall. If we wind up with a July like our December, when people shut down and nobody did anything and everyone went to [inaudible] for the month, then I think there are some risks to that. If July turns out to be a reasonable month, and there are no disasters, I think the estimate is probably in the mid-range of what's probably going to happen. Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan In terms of our thoughts on just inventory versus demand out there, it sounds like you're thinking that the channel is going to reduce inventory again in your end markets and maybe it's wait until next quarter where your business starts tracking in demand, is that a correct statement? Jerald G. Fishman What the channel does with our inventory doesn't affect our sales very much. It more affects our production levels. So we really don't know the answer to your question, so I mean, we get orders every week from the distributors, they get orders every week from the customers, we watch it very closely to see if there are any trends. You know, the distributor inventory is down quite a bit over the last two quarters. So on the other hand the turns are about flat because their sales are way down. So when the turns are about flat it's hard to predict which way they're going to apply pressure on this thing. If they believe the market is going to get stronger the end of the year and they're worried about shortages in the foundries and the like, I think they'll start to add inventory. If it turns out hopefully that they won't. I think that they could probably give you a better picture of what they're going to do with their inventories because we sure don't know. Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan I was thinking more on your end customers or direct customers. And any words of wisdom for us on what you think their inventory trends are? Are they done working it down? Jerald G. Fishman I guess we hear different stories from different customers but I think generallyI mean, inventories came down pretty far so what it really has to do is, are they really optimistic or pessimistic about the future. In other words, there are some customers that basically keep singing the blues and I think those customers will continue to bang the inventories down. And there are many other customers that actually now are getting concerned about their inventory levels. They are very low. There's all the reports coming out of Taiwan about foundry capacity and so on. And they're getting a little nervous that they pushed this pretty hard. It's very interesting that this cycle, it's true that the reaction of customers to demand changes is about the most extreme we've ever seen, so customers this time were not going to make the mistake they made in 2001 and they reacted enormously quickly and severely to the changing outlook for their business. The good news is that got a lot of inventory out the cycle quickly and that's why I think when the demand, or the sentiment out there about the economy and what's going to happen, gets better, I think the snap-back will be good. But it's very hard to predict on as wide a customer base what the average customer is going to do. I think we have customers in both camps. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Dave, you mentioned the growing delta between your capex and depreciation. When do we start to see depreciation falling meaningful? Is that the middle of next year after the two fabs are shut down or is it later than that? David A. Zinsner Well, actually, depreciation will have a pretty decent fall, I think, next quarter but you really won't see that savings to the P&amp;L because most of that gets kind of hung on the balance sheet until the first quarter of next year.  So there will be kind of a step function decline in the next couple of quarters but then after that our best estimation is that it's going to kind of trail downward over the next five years or so because that's generally what we put the capital on the balance sheet at. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company And then more of a revenue question for Jerry. Jerry, you talked about, on this call and prior calls, the growth in the industrials business in China. Can you help us understand how big that business is relative to our overall industrials business, and how should we think about the growth characteristics of that business versus the broader industrials over the next couple of years? Jerald G. Fishman I don't have the exact numbers in front of us, we are going to have to dig those out for you, but I would say generally it's not surprising there's a huge industrialization. That's been going in China. Our sense when we talk to these large industrial customers over there, is that the government is really pumping an awful lot of money into new factories, for obvious reasons.  Now, eventually those factories have to produce stuff that sells, at the beginning in China but ultimately they have got to export stuff to justify all that and they're making a bet that when the economy starts turning in other locations that the exports out of China are going to go up very dramatically. So I think initially, mostly, it's to support Chinese consumption but eventually it's going to wind up supporting American and European and Japanese and other consumption. So I don't have any doubt that we've put in a tremendous amount of focus to building our industrial and other businesses in China because we really believe it's going to be like the United States as 40 or 50 years ago, where there was the industrial revolution here. And that business was an enormously fast growing business. So we have put in a fair amount of infrastructure into China. You know, the early signs are that our brand in China, which is a very good leading indicator of our industrial sales across many, many companies, is very strong in China. We have a great team over there and we have good leadership there. We have a lot of good engineers over there that actually design some of the products and we have good sales people and applications people over there.  So I think China is not only going to be the home of some of the very high volume commoditized products, but it's also going to provide a great opportunity for those that get in early into the base of what will turn out to be tens of thousands of industrial customers in China. It's not going to be any different than the United States in that way and Europe. It's just going to be about 40 years, 50 years later than in the U.S. So that's an important business lesson. I think if you want us to try to quantify that any more we would have to dig into the data, which I don't happen to have in front of me, but I would say, on a absolute basis, it's not a very significant part of our industrial business but certainly the percentage of our industrial business as it is has been climbing as that business has been growing and the rest of it leapt the track. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Jerry, you mentioned the converter market share data. As we've gone through the downturn, have you noticed any change in competitive dynamics in your core converter and amplifier businesses? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think everybody wants it. That's not a big change in this part of the cycle. So I think there's competition out there. There's always competition, always has been competition. So our job is just to continue the rate of innovation. We have a very dominant brand with the largest consumers of converter products and we have done a pretty job at Analog of doing that, despite all the competition over the last couple of years. So our job is to make sure we don't take our eyes off that ball since that is, those are, one of the most important things we do in analog. So, so far so good. We keep enormous pressure on making sure our technology is really strong, the customers know it, the sales guys sell it and I think there are a lot of people who find it hard to believe that in a market that size with all the competition we have been able to do as well as we have over the past five years in that business. So we are trying hard not to get complacent about that but it is an important of the R&amp;D that we put into the company and it's a very important part of our competitive advantage. Operator Your next question comes from David Wu - Global Crown Capital. David Wu - Global Crown Capital Dave, maybe you could help me with this. Once you consolidated two fabs in the first quarter fiscal 2010 how much does your manufacturing cost decline? Do you get it all at once or do you have it spread over two consecutive quarters and won't get the full amount until Q2? David A. Zinsner Actually, we don't get the full amount until the third quarter but the reason is more to do with how the inventory gets digested, so we have actually completed the Limerick consolidation for the most part so from a cash flow basis we are already seeing the savings but that inventory has to get digested through the system and that won't happen until the first quarter of 2010. So that's roughly about $6.0 a quarter, or $24.0 million or $25.0 million a year on an annualized basis.  Then the Cambridge consolidation with Wilmington happens at the end of this year and we'll start seeing the cash flow benefit of that at the beginning of next year, however, because we will build some inventory obviously on that and that has to get digested, our expectation is that will happen in the first two quarters of fiscal 2010 and so the new inventory at new cost, excluding these expenses associated with Cambridge, will start to be realized through the P&amp;L in the third quarter of 2010. That's roughly about $10.0 million a quarter, or about $40.0 million on an annualized basis.  So by the third quarter of 2010 the expectation is that we're at the $65.0 million of annualized savings run rate. David Wu - Global Crown Capital The $6.0 million would be achieved by what, the second quarter? David A. Zinsner The first quarter of 2010. David Wu - Global Crown Capital So $6.0 million and then $16.0 million by the third quarter. David A. Zinsner Right. David Wu - Global Crown Capital The second question I have is regarding this utilization rate. Once you consolidate your two fabs, does it automatically move higher? From the 40% rate that you have currently. David A. Zinsner Yes, we have more capacity than we need. We're eliminating some of that capacity so the utilization rate does improve. David Wu - Global Crown Capital Would it jump 10 or 15 points? David A. Zinsner I think it is about 10 points that it jumps. Operator Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech Can you spend a little bit of time talking about this cycle and what you are expecting to see from an ASP trend standpoint? Are there any early signs of aggressive behavior from your competitors? Jerald G. Fishman There are always competitors that are a little erratic on the pricing. We have live with that for many years but it is interesting when you look at ADI, our average selling price, which is made up of many different customers, many markets, many products, and many geographies, and many currencies, our average selling price hasn't moved very much. So there is always competitive pressure. We have good competitors, some of them are very aggressive on price, but overall, our average selling price has been reasonably flat for quite a while. On a particular product, the average selling prices typically go down as the products get older and then the ones that get really old go back up. In the analog business, that's just the way it happens when some of those products have 20-year life cycles.  But there are incidences where we have competition and they quote a lower price and sometimes we react to it and sometimes we don't. And sometimes we have a better product that we can sell them at a lower price than the old product we sold them. That's just the nature of this business. But I don't see any alarming trends that are significantly reducing our average selling price in anyplace really in the market. We always have aggressive competitors. There are some that think we are an aggressive competitor to other people's business that's out there, so it really depends on where you sit and what product areas you're in. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech Do you think you could compare your July quarter guidance to your April quarter guidance and what level of tier you're pricing into your guidance, because clearly you said you were very concerned entering the present quarter that you just put up and you're still sort of echoing a level of concern. Can you calibrate us on how that's changed? Jerald G. Fishman I think it's a little bit less concerned than last quarter. Last quarter when we put the guidance out, you know, when you have a downward spiral it's always hard to predict the rate of that spiral whether it's going to abate or accelerate. I think the thing that's been encouraging, to a bunch of pessimists like us, are that the weekly order rates have been remarkably consistent for about three months now and when the rates are consistent you are not seeing rates that are 40% or 50% different every week, it gives you a little more confidence that there's a broad customer base out there that has sort of calibrated their worlds at a certain level. So I think there's always ups and downs in that but certainly the stability in the business we've seen gives us a little more confidence than when you're in a downward spiral. I think having said that, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there and we could have put out a large range and said it might be down some, might be up some and everybody would have put a flat number there anyhow, so we just sort of said that's about the plan for the quarter, that as you said, there is still uncertainty out there. I wouldn't in any way say that plan is a slam dunk. I don't think it's a sandbag plan. On the other hand, at least if I listen to our sales guys and our product guys, I don't think any of them are contending that there's a disaster out there. But plus or minus a few percent it's always very hard to call. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Whalen Citigroup. Terence Whalen Citigroup With regard to gross margin, given that we are taking about 300 basis points plus out of the gross margin from the COGS reductions of the Limerick and Massachusetts fabs, and also based on lower depreciation, Dave, looking out several years, assuming you get back to a $2.5 billion annual run rate, would the gross margin level be somewhere above 65% then? David A. Zinsner It's tough to call based on mix. What we know is that the last time we were at the 650 level we were at 61% gross margins. We feel pretty confident that we can do better than that. The question is how much I think is really dependent on mix. We have got obviously the depreciation going in our favor, some of which is coming from the consolidations, but some of it is coming from lower capital spending. We also have the consolidations, which takes out fixed costs outside of depreciation.  So we feel like we have got a lot of momentum going in our favor for gross margins. Mix will ultimately play a factor in that and our belief is that we can get well above 61%. I don't know exactly what level we will ultimately end at. Jerald G. Fishman I think the way to think about is, again, we're running 55, so let's calibrate the world on that. And we have put in a lot of programs to fundamentally reduce the cost of goods sold for analog devices, and most of those are these fab consolidations, there's other things that we've done to fundamentally reduce the cost structure.  I think that as we get closer and we start seeing sequential increases in the gross margin line rather than sequential decreases, as we've seen, I think we can be a lot more thoughtful and accurate about what actual gross margin we can achieve.  I think what we're really trying to do and what we have been trying to do, is start putting up quarters when business gets better where the gross margins go up, the opex ratio goes down and we've got a lot of leverage on the sales as they increase. I think trying to pin down the specifics of that when we're at 55% gross margin and 15% operating profit is very hard to do. So I think each quarter as we get more confidenceall we can really do is tell you the things we've done and what we think the cost savings are as a result of that. Those are things that are under our control that we know. The rest of it, we'll just have to wait and see how it goes. And what we're trying to build is a model tier with extremely high leverage. That's the take away. Terence Whalen Citigroup Regarding the monthly order linearity in the July quarter. It sounds like you're staying with a little bit higher backlog for the July quarter than you had started for the April quarter. And implied in that maybe is a little bit of tapering in the month of July orders. What are the swing factors that will determine whether July does taper off and might be expected for a flat number, or what would be the potential source of upside in your view, based on what you see now, potentially in July? Would it be coming from better comps, infrastructure? Would it be coming from some aseasonal industrial pickup or would it be the consumer and computing businesses? Jerald G. Fishman The third quarter will really depend more I think than any major trends in any of the segments, which I think are relatively small relative to our sales, will depend on just how customers feel about the world. If we get out to July and everybody is still thinking the world is coming unglued and the like, I think July could turn out to be a bad month and we will be on the long side of this. I think if it turns out that as we get out to July and people are believing that the end of the year is going to be good, that there is reason for the economies to believe that they are going to get a little bit better, and customers a little less afraid, credit eases up and you don't keep hearing about 600,000 jobs a month being lost in the U.S. and so on, and people get a little more confident, I think we could get better than typical seasonality in July. Because I think people are concerned about how low the inventories are. So I think we're not going to know that until July and I think that most of it, at least my view, other than some small ups and downs between one market segment or another, I think it will be mostly dependent upon sentiment out there. And that's the thing that's so hard to predict. Operator Your final question comes from Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML. Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML Dave, in terms of the reduction in infrastructure expenses or the plan to reduce those expenses, can you tell us what the extent of the benefit from that will be and how it will flow through in coming quarters? David A. Zinsner Some of which we have actually taken action on and you are seeing the savings in the drop we've gotten to today at the $192.0 million level. There is some benefit coming in the next few quarters. It's of the few million dollars per quarter kind of range, from we have talked about to date. We are still lookingwe have an active process of looking at infrastructure expenses and identifying better and less expensive ways to go about delivering our infrastructure services to the company and over the next couple of quarters I think we will identify more opportunities but at this point we are unable to quantify it. Getting back to Jerry's comment at the very beginning, the opex is at $192.0 million and our goal is to really constrain that a lot while revenues are flat and if things return to growth, which we assume they will at some point, is to really constrain the growth on opex so that it is much slower than the growth on the revenue side, until we see a lot of leverage. Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML Given that you are reporting a month after a lot of other companies, is it clear to you that there is going to be a pause in the China 3G build out here in the July quarter. Is that how you're planning for business or are the lead times still short that you don't know for sure? Jerald G. Fishman We never know for sure. I think that we know sort of that we listened to a lot of our competitors who talked about that a little bit. When you talk to the large companies in China there is sort of differences of opinion of their views on what's going to happen this quarter. A lot of these products are very short delivery items so we don't really know, but I would say generically we are planning for a little bit of weakness on the Chinese side of the infrastructure market and not so much weakness on the European and U.S. side of the infrastructure market. But built into our assumptions is this, probably, certainly the rate of growth is going to pause for a while there and it's possible it could decline sequentially quarter-to-quarter. But I think the important take away for us on that business is it's not going to be a very long one. There is a tremendous build out that's still ahead of us and whenever you see a large increase in a business as we've seen, in the Chinese infrastructure business, it wouldn't be surprising to see a pause, although there's lots of different opinions about that. But the direct answer to your question is our assumptions are that is going to decline a little bit in the third quarter although not a tremendous amount. Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML And that's an assumption or based on actual feedback? Jerald G. Fishman I think it's a combination of both.

Jerry Fishman Well, good afternoon, thanks again for joining us on this afternoons call. As you can see from the earnings release that we put out earlier, the first quarter was another very strong quarter for ADI and the beginning of what we hope will be a strong year for ADI. The recovery which began in our third fiscal quarter last year and picked up momentum in our fourth quarter has carried over into our first fiscal quarter of 2010. Our revenues grew 5.5% sequentially, during the quarter thats typically a seasonally slow period at ADI, after growing 16% sequentially the prior quarter. We are very encouraged that our industrial revenues grew significantly this quarter. This business spans many different applications in factory automation, process control, instrumentation, automatic test equipment, energy management, military and aerospace, and also healthcare, and is comprised of literally tens of thousands of customers around the world. Revenues from communications infrastructure and automotive also grew during the quarter. Its important to note that we are now breaking out automotive from the industrial category where we typically reported automotive beginning for the first time this quarter, given the fact that automotive has now become a more important strategic focus for ADI and is not getting to be a meaningful size relative to the rest of our business. Importantly, our lead times have remained short and we continue to deliver over 99% of our shipments to our OEM customers within six weeks or less. This is consistent with our performance in the previous quarter and represents what is typical lead times for ADI. Maintaining short lead times reduces the chances of excess ordering by customers. In addition, distribution inventory has remained stable at approximately eight weeks, which is also consistent with the prior quarter. This of course is positive in the short term as that allows to meet our customers requirements on a short-term basis, but I think equally important is the lasting impact that we believe it will have as am I sure ADI remains a trusted and reliable partner to our customers for the longer term. During Q1 we continued progress for making ADI a structurally more profitable company. Our gross margins improved by approximately 480 basis points sequentially and operating margins excluding restructuring costs are now 270 basis points higher than our most recent peak when quarterly revenue was approximately $60 million higher. We expect to continue to continue to expand the operating margins in coming quarters through gross margin expansion and continuing very tight control of operating expenses. We believe that we can retain approximately 50% of our expense reductions as permanent cost reductions, which is in line with our earlier estimates. As we entered this downturn, we set in place a strategy to be more focused on products and our markets that value innovation, and also to become a more profitable company. In some cases we increased investments, in others we slowed or ceased investments in areas where innovation was no longer the primary driver. As a result we believe we are very well positioned for solid growth and exceptional profitability going forward as the economies around the world continue to improve. So now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will provide more detail on our financials. Dave Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. Revenue was $603 million, a 5.5% increase from the prior quarter and a 26.5% increase from the first quarter of 2009. Our order strength continued last quarter and we finished the quarter with a higher backlog and a book-to-bill ratio above one. Gross margins were 61.1%, a 480 basis point increase from the prior quarter and a 470 basis point from the first quarter of last year. Although there are many different factors that impact our gross margin, the increase was primarily due to lower infrastructure costs, higher utilization, and a more favorable mix of revenue. Factory utilization was in the low 60s in the first quarter as we ramped production to match increasing order rates. Should business levels justify it, we can add significant amounts of internal manufacturing capacity quickly and with relatively little additional capital spend. Our goal continues to be to keep our lead times short and reliable. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $219 million including a $16.5 million restructuring charge or $203 million excluding the charge. This charge along with higher variable compensation expense resulted in higher operating expenses. The restructuring charge included approximately $5 million related to the final closure of our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility and represents the cost associated with decommissioning of that facility. The other $11.5 million reflects actions taken during the first quarter to continue to sharpen our focus in product development and reduce infrastructure expenses. When fully implemented, we expect these actions will result in savings of approximately $4.5 million per quarter. The remaining increase in operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense, in line with significantly higher operating margins in the first quarter. Variable compensation is primarily based on operating margins, which we believe tightly aligns the interest of our shareholder and our employees, given the historical relationship between operating margins and share price. Excluding variable compensation and restructuring, operating expenses were flat with the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating margins, excluding restructuring charges were 27.5%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, our tax rate was approximately 20.3% more typical for ADI than the unusually low tax rate booked in the previous quarter. We expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to continue at approximately this level. For the first quarter, excluding restructuring charges, we earned $0.43 per diluted share, which was an increase of 19% from the prior quarter on a 5.5% increase in revenue despite a change in the tax rate quarter to quarter. Weighted average shares outstanding increased by 4% to 305 million shares. This is the result of the exercise of stock options that were due to expire in the first quarter and a higher average stock price for the quarter as compared to last quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet, for the quarter we generated approximately $200 million in free cash flow or 33% of sales and finished the quarter with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and marketable securities with $380 million of debt. In line with the higher revenue, accounts receivable increased slightly in dollar terms this quarter. However, our days sales outstanding declined by one day to 47 days. Inventory declined $10 million to $243 million and the days of inventory remained low at 95 days. As I mentioned before, we believe that in inventory levels between 90 to 100 days is an optimal level given our mix of internal and external manufacturing. This keeps our carrying cost of inventory low, but allows us to meet the short lead time requirements of our customers. Inventory distribution increased slightly this quarter in line wit the increased sales in that channel. However, on a turns basis inventory remained flat with the prior quarter. In summary, from a financial perspective, this was another excellent quarter for the Company. Now, I will turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Fishman Well, thanks Dave. With regard to what happened in the end markets for the first quarter, our industrial business, which is now approximately 43% of sales grew 16% sequentially. You should recall as I explained earlier that industrial category no longer includes the automotive sales. We saw a broad based growth across many applications, including instrumentation and process control, test equipment, healthcare, defense and aerospace. Our revenues from our automotive customers, which now represent in the first quarter 12% of sales, grew an additional 5% sequentially after a few previous quarters of very substantial growth. While certainly some of the strength that weve experienced over the last few quarters is likely inventory replenishment, we are also the beneficiary of increasing electronic content per vehicle and also a very strong automotive product portfolio. The increased content in automobiles for ADI is driven by applications in infotainment and safety and in Powertrain electronics. In the area of safety, for example, the widespread deployment of stability control systems is driving growth for our MEMS gyroscope products. It also appears that consumers are gaining interest in advanced driver assistance features such as lane departure warning and reverse camera console views, many of which use our DSP or data converter and also our RF products. Our communications business, which is primarily products for infrastructure and to a lesser degree handsets, is now approximately 22% of our revenues. Revenues from communications customers increased 12% sequentially. The growth of this market is being primarily driven by the ramp and deployment of 3G base stations worldwide. While last year growth was dominated by heavy capital spending in China earlier in the year, in Q1 this year the growth was much more diversified. In the developed countries, the need for higher data transmission capacity is the main driver, while in developing countries the need to increase coverage is driving demand. We also saw an increase in revenues from the wireline communications market. Although today this is still a smaller piece of the communications business, its had very steady growth now for many quarters at ADI. Revenue from consumer related products declined 18% sequentially, which is generally in line with the typical pattern that we see in the consumer business for Analog given our the months in our first quarter. Our main focus areas in consumer continue to be in home entertainment products and digital cameras and also many portable products. On a regional basis, revenues grew in all our regions except Japan in line with the consumer business decline and of course Japan in that sense was down sequentially. So, I would like now to make some closing comments on the outlook and look at it really in the short term and also take a slightly longer term perspective or in at least our view whats happening around the world. In our Q2, which weve just now begun, we expect industrial sales to be both cyclically and seasonally strong. We expect further strength in the communications infrastructure as a result of additional base station deployments, including what we hope will be a resurgence in our growth in China. We expect consumer sales to be approximately flat sequentially. In total, we are expecting our revenues as we mentioned in our press release to increase to $635 million to $650 million, which would represent a 35% year-over-year increase in our sales at the midpoint of this estimate. We are planning the gross margins to increase sequentially to 62% to 63% and that would produce operating margins in the range of 29% to 31% in the quarter, and earnings in the range of $0.48 to $0.51. For reference, in the fourth quarter of 08, before the recession began, revenues were at a similar level to our Q2 forecast, but our operating margins were approximately five percentage points lower. So overall we believe we are executing well on our plan to deliver good sales growth, and attractive and increasing margins. I think there is very little doubt that there continues to be a stability in most economies around the world as in many locations around the world unemployment levels remain high and credit is still tight. Nevertheless, our business has broadly strengthened over the past few quarters and order rates and backlog levels are now approaching pre-recession levels. While the amplitude and the timing of the order recovery suggests that some of the order strength is likely due to a more confident supply chain as the economy recovers, we believe based on feedback from many of our customers in many, many different industries and many countries around the world that companies are generally more confident about the future and have begun to shift from a fear of over investing to a fear of under investing and losing global competitive position. As a result, many of our customers have begun to ramp new product program at a pretty significant rate and certainly that will benefit ADI in coming quarters. Despite these changing attitudes, which are generally more positive than three months ago, the bar for new investments at many of our customers is still stacked pretty high. Our customers are looking for partners who can consistently innovate to make their products more appealing and more competitive and also those wholl have a flexible supply chain to respond to changing business conditions. From productivity improvements at factories around the world to medicines to entertainment, to transportation and many other applications, our customers want products that allow their products to always be connected, to be easily used and to conserve energy. These strengths play very well to ADIs business strategy, which continues to be as it has for many years to focus on being the very best signal processing company in the world. In March, during our analyst day, investors will learn a little bit more about the trends we see and how they are driving many, many new opportunities for ADI. So, I hope you will all be able to join us for the webcast of that event. So, thats all the formal comments we are going to make today. Well now open the line up for questions from analysts. Dave Zinsner Thank you, Jerry. During todays question-and-answer period, please limit yourself to one primary question and no more than one follow-on question. Well give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we are now ready for questions from our analysts.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator  Our first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Barclays Capital. Romit Shah Barclays Capital Thanks guys and great quarter. Jerry, you had three quarters now of pretty substantial growth yet your revenue is still below the prior peak. At what point do you think youll catch up with demand or see the business return to more normal or seasonal growth rate? Jerry Fishman Thats sort of hard to predict into the future. You know, our sense right now particularly in the way that we are managing the distribution channel is that consumption and the demand we are seeing is not terribly unaligned [ph]. I think over the last couple of quarters weve caught up with what has been under consumption. Well, there is probably another quarter where thats going to be a little bit above the top, but I think ultimately once we get back to sort of where we were, which we expect to be approximately next quarter plus or minus a little bit, I think it will be in a reasonably good balance between what demand underlying consumption and the demand we are seeing. Romit Shah Barclays Capital Are there any segments within your business where you feel there is still pretty big supply-demand imbalance? Jerry Fishman I think for ADI, I dont see. There certainly was a supply and demand imbalance last year, but I think customers inventories, at least what they tell us are reasonably low. The distribution inventory that Dave was saying are relatively flat in terms of turns and weeks of inventory. Our lead times are short so they dont have a lot of inspiration to be loading up inventories. So at least for ADI, I dont see that patterns are very unique here. Romit Shah Barclays Capital Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Great, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations on the great results. This cycle so far you guys have clearly demonstrated better operating margin leverage than in past cycles. What can you do over the next few quarters as business continues to improve to make sure you keep that margin discipline and not let some of the expense creep come back in like it might have in other cycles? Thanks Jerry Fishman Well, I think as far as the expense creep we sort of early in the cycle said that some of the expenses that we reduced were going to come back with sales and those are mostly related to variable compensation and commissions. Others were permanent. And I think our sense is that about half of those things, which is consistent with the way weve been thinking about it are permanent and half of them are going to come back as the sales go up. So that basically allows us to operate the Company at about $100 million a year of less expenses than we had when we went into this cycle, which is not insignificant for our size. As far as keeping our hands on the  doing the right things, we do have a lot more focus on products and markets that are higher margin and more substantial than weve had in the past. I dont think we are going to revert back to having less focus. So I think that focus is going to continue. I think the entire management group and the employee base is pretty committed to keeping discipline on the expense line and I think with the goal that we set of keeping  gains on the operating costs, I think we have a good shot of doing that. I believe the gross margins in the Company is structurally higher. Part of that is of course due to volume and utilization, but another part of it is just due to a much richer product mix and us exiting businesses that had very poor returns over many years over the last two or three years. So, its always challenging quarter-to-quarter to predict whether the gross margins are going to be up a point or down a point, but I think we are up here at levels, which are about where the best weve ever been. We have a forecast for next quarter, which will exceed that by quite a bit, and I dont think there is anything in there other than the world falling apart thus having to bank down utilization and things like that, which are always its possible although not probable in the short term. Other than that, I think we have a good chance of not only keeping these margins, but as were forecasting for Q2 the margins are likely to expand again in Q2. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Terrific. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Quick question again on the OpEx, so I know you said you are going to keep half of the gains. Do I define the gains at this point as versus Q408, so ex-restructuring youd be down $37 million quarterly? And does that mean that basically youd be creeping about call it $19 million or $20 million a year of those cuts going forward? Dave Zinsner No, I think the way you got to look at it is we were at $240 million in Q4 of 08 Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Yes. Dave Zinsner What we are thinking is that we brought the OpEx down to about $187 million, so we roughly took it down by a little over $50 million and what we are saying is that well be able to keep half of that difference as we resume back to the revenue levels of Q4 of 08. So, basically we feel like we permanently took out from the $240 million run rate burn rate we were in Q4 of 08, we permanently took out somewhere in the $25 million plus of OpEx expense or an annualized basis a little over $100 million. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it. So, some of thats already started to come back. So this quarter you are if ex-restructuring your OpEx was up, I think it was about 4% or so versus last quarter which is almost about where your revenue was up at this point, revenue was up 5.5%, how do we think about OpEx trending through the year again as revenue goes up because I know more variable compensation is going to kick in as the operating margin continues to increase potentially. Jerry Fishman Well, I think one way to think of that is, at least I will give you my view, Dave will give you his, is that weve been on a very steep part of the margin improvement curve. We raised the margins five points in one quarter. That tends to, given that most of the bonus payments are tailored to that statistic, it tends to drive it through the yard [ph], I think we have more margin upside as we are predicting for the next quarter, but we are not going to keep getting 500 basis points of margin improvement every quarter, so I think the rates of increase on the variable side is going to start trending downward. Its still going to go up in dollars, but the rate is going to go down from where it is. The thing that we are focusing on more than anything else is everything acceptance and if we can do what we are trying to do, which is to keep that part relatively flat through the year, I think the operating margins will keep going up and everyone will be very pleased with the operating margins that we are running in the Company. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it, thanks. And for my followup, I mean I notice now you are providing the end market breakdown with like a pure industrial, if I compare where you are this quarter to where you were two years ago, so Q108, I notice that for all these particularly in the broader industrial, you are almost back to those levels. I think you are only down about 4% Q1 2010 versus Q1 of 2008. I am not so sure that the industrial markets themselves are only down 4% from that point to this point, so whats actually driving I mean is it share gains or is it I mean we talked about customers moving back to replenishment mode and so forth but I mean whats what do you think is actually driving what seems to be probably a greater increase for your industrial sales and even some of your other product categories versus where the market probably is these days? Jerry Fishman Well, I think I mean its always hard to look at one quarter two years ago versus a quarter now to try to garner any specific, but I think generically, some of the segments within the industrial area for us, which has always been a source of significant investment are just growing faster than the average of the industrial market. If you take areas like the healthcare products, historically in these numbers here the automotive stuff  has been growing very well for us. And a few of the other segments where you just have very rich new product cycles going on in that market. So, Id say that, that business for us is doing a lot better than many outsiders, investors thought and certainly even better than we thought it was going to be a couple of years ago. And part of that is just that we are investing a lot of money in segments within industrial that are pretty high growth relative to most other segments. So I think we have a pretty good outlook for that business over the next couple of years. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it guys, appreciate it. Jerry Fishman Its certainly not the stodgy old growth business that some people want to call us. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it, got it, thank you guys. Jerry Fishman And it makes pretty good margins too. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Yes, indeed. Operator Our next question is from Terence Whalen with Citigroup. Terence Whalen Citigroup Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first part relates to I think last quarter you had talked a little bit about some restructuring and reorganization that you had done internally with regard to the sales force and how your sales force is interfacing with customer accounts Jerry Fishman Yes. Terence Whalen Citigroup And in addition talked a little bit about how that improved some of the granularity of your rolling up of the individual business units financials. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit of details what youve learned over the past quarter after implementing that reorganization and also what metric now that you are looking out on an individual business unit level, what you are learning from looking at this new metric? Thank you. Jerry Fishman Well, its a very important question. Well, let me try to give you a broad answer to it. Now I think from the way the experience that we had over the last couple of months, weve learnt something that we it doesnt sound like rocket science. We probably knew all along, but its really become true is that customers really value when we approach them from a single point with the breadth of our technology. And thats the way they prefer to deal with us. They dont like dealing with many, many different product lines that are basically trying to sell various products to them as compared to really trying to understand how to make them more competitive and therefore what solutions can we bring them to do that in a very cohesive fashion.  So, I think what it really has done is it makes the customers believe that we are a much more strategic partner to them in their particular business. It allows to focus the resources towards customers in a way that we havent been able to do before. And it really focuses the sales force on where it is that they ought to be spending their time and attention as compared to trying to react to the request for 47 different product lines for more sales in the quarter. So, you know, those are things that when you listen to me say, well thats sort of elementary. But for a company thats grown up as a product oriented company, it really this new organization has really helped focus what we are doing a lot more than it used to.  Now, is that changing our sales in the quarter right now, I dont think so, but I think what we are trying is the sales force is better focused on the right accounts. If they go into the customers with a much more cohesive plan, a much more cohesive roadmap, a much more ingrained understanding of what the customers are trying to accomplish, I think thats going to help us greatly. And weve gotten that kind of feedback from some of our very largest customers that in applications where they just found us too complicated to deal with they really appreciate the fact that we are we understand their application, we got to make them competitive and we are approaching that from a single point. From the internal metrics standpoint, it gives us a much clearer sense of where we are making money and what the investment levels are relative to the returns I the marketplace, and now when you are product oriented company its somehow hard to understand that by market segment. Now, we have a tremendous amount of data that really shows which of the segments growing faster, which of the segments are taking more investment, what are some of the returns that we are getting on the R&amp;D in each of the segments, and as a result of that not in the quarter-to-quarter numbers, but certainly a we put together the yearly plans, we take that into account in what we do about allocating resources to various marketplace.  So, I think in aggregate its it really helped us deal with customers and it helps us to grow [ph] at a more productively allocate resources in the Company, which in companies like ADI its very hard oftentimes because of the complexity with 10,000 products  customers. I mean thats really going to sharpen our focus and weve already seeing the benefits of that. Terence Whalen Citigroup Thanks for answering comprehensively the broad question. As my followup Id like to be a little bit more specific with regard to gross margin, weve got utilization in the low 60s and we are looking at a 62% to 63% gross margin. Specifically is the longer term gross margin model then going to be closer to 64% to 65%? Thanks Jerry Fishman Are you asking that or are you saying that as a conclusion? Terence Whalen Citigroup That was a question, thanks. Jerry Fishman Well, when we get to 63% maybe well talk about higher numbers, but we are certainly a lot more enthusiastic about gross margins we can generate this fiscal than we were when we were really struggling. And I think investors were struggling to really think could we ever get to 60%. And I think now we are comfortably past 60% we certainly be very comfortably past 60% next quarter and I dont think thats a one-time event either given that we are still not breaking the growth that will allow utilization. So, well see how that goes after another quarter and well update you next quarter. Terence Whalen Citigroup Thanks and a nice job. Operator Our next question is from Uche Orji with UBS Warburg. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Can you hear me? Jerry Fishman Yes. Dave Zinsner Yes. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Alright, thank you very much. I wanted to just follow on same one thing, Jerry, what was your peak utilization rate and I know thats also that things are going to gross margins, but I just wanted to try to get a handle if we were to get back to peak utilization rate just what could be the optimized [ph] gross margin. Jerry Fishman Well, the utilization rate relative to the past years, somewhat complexity right now since we had two more fabs. Last time we were at this thing. One of the reasons the utilization went up this quarter, there are really two reasons, one is we started more wafers, but the other part is weve taken a lot of capacity offline. We took the Cambridge fab offline and we took the eight inch fab in Ireland the six inch fab in Ireland offline. So, those comparisons relative to the past are a little bit more challenging to make. Now I would say that if utilization goes up our gross margins will go up. Thats intuitive. Its very hard to quantify that any more definitively than that. At below 60s, we can easily run fabs up until the mid 80s. I think that will have a positive impact on the margins. As Dave mentioned earlier, we can increase our capacity relatively quickly with relatively low capital expenditures. So I think relative to capacity and the margin implications of that I think we are in reasonably good shape. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Great. Can I just ask you about power management, I mean weve started to see some numbers  close to $40 million of revenue for the quality advantage? Can you talk about you expectations for this business now? What will be the drivers, whats allowing you to gain traction now and what should we be expecting from this going forward? Jerry Fishman Well, our power management business grew this quarter pretty well. It grew fairly substantially year-over-year. And I think there is a couple of reasons for that. One is the fact that the team has been working at it for a couple of years and its congealed, and weve got a pretty good group of people that are developing some products that our customers say are pretty good. I think another part of it is weve focused our product development into areas that we really think we can offer something very unique and the customers value as compared to trying to do things that a lot of other companies can do and you are just in a margin war with them to get those sockets. And I think the more that we align our power management business with our vertical market segments, we are we can go into customers where we already have a substantial part of the signal processing bill of materials and we can say you know by the way we can either integrate power management on the signal processing chain or we can offer power management alongside of the signal processing chain and the customers already respect us for our prowess in developing products and they like working with us and that becomes an important ingredient in the overall solution and the more that we focus our product development efforts in those areas as we have for the past year or so I think the more traction we are going to get in that business. So, I think like everything its a combination of things, but overall we are doing better in that business than we have in the past and I think there is good expectations that if we continue to really focus that business in the areas I just addressed we can do even better in the future. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Right, thank you very much. Operator Our next question is from Christopher Danely with JP Morgan. Christopher Danely JP Morgan Hey, thanks guys, and, yes, Ill add my congrats on hitting new peak gross margin. On it seems like the mix and the focus is changing a little bit via the end markets and products. So, can you just give us your sense on where you would expect the highest and lowest relative growth rates for your end markets for the rest of this calendar year? Jerry Fishman Its hard enough to predict what the sales are going to be. The market segments are even more challenging with more granularity. But because we just dont have all that much visibility up until the second half of the year. But I would say that we expect that well get growth across the board, which is where weve been seeing weve seen good growth in industrial, weve been seeing good growth in communications. I think in the second half of the year the acceleration in communications in hopefully going to come from China; its what we now expect. We are seeing good growth in automotive. The consumer business is relatively cyclical. In these quarters they are low, theyll pick up again when the season changes. So, I dont think it will be anything unique personally in the segments. I think it will be more typically of what we usually see. Certain quarters we get higher industrial growth, certain quarters we get higher consumer or communications growth, but I dont think there will be anything unique for the balance of the year that at least we understand right now. Christopher Danely JP Morgan Okay, thanks. And then my followup for Dave, Dave, I think you said three things that the gross margins went up. Where any of those I guess having a bigger factor than the others? Dave Zinsner No, they all had a meaningful contribution to the gross margin improvement. Christopher Danely JP Morgan And then can you give us a sense of what your incremental gross margins will continue to be as the utilization rates climb? Dave Zinsner You know its challenging to do that because we do some the revenue will come from external manufacturing and in that you dont get any incremental benefits from versus the internal, so its a kind of a tough metric to really quantify. Jerry Fishman There is not an in respect to that there is not an entire we can't draw the curve between gross margins and utilization. So it has a lot to do with product mix. I think right now would be sort of what I think seems to be pretty aggressive guidance for Q2 on the gross margin after what we just achieved. It sort of gives you an indication of at least directionally where we are thinking its going to head. Christopher Danely JP Morgan Yes, okay, thanks a lot guys. Operator Our next question is from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird Hi, just another question on gross margin. Youve given us the mix the gross margin sequentially increased, if you look at your revenue guidance, which is very close to what you posted in the second quarter of 2008, your gross margin guidance is also 150 basis points higher than two years ago. How much of this do you think will be mix and then within those that base station play will in those? Jerry Fishman Dave? Dave Zinsner Yes, I mean I couldnt answer that question. I mean what really drove the year over or the comparison from Q408 was we took a lot of infrastructure cost out. We are taking we took out of Limerick six inch facility and that contributed a lot to our gross margins and then going forward well start to see the benefits of shutting down Cambridge, and that will show up in our P&amp;L and thats going to be driving the kind of the future performance. So, Id hazard a guess that it probably didnt have a meaningful impact from mix or utilization. It was really about fundamentally lowering the cost per unit of our product. Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird Okay. And eight weeks of inventories at distributors is probably unusually even though thats stable with the previous quarter. Is your guidance assuming any type of inventory replenishment and what type of feedback do you get from distributors over the next for the next few quarters? Dave Zinsner Well, on a guidance perspective, it doesnt really matter, because we recognize the revenue once the distributors ships this out of their inventory. So Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird And then for the gross margin? Dave Zinsner Sorry, what was that? Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird And then for the gross margin, so are you is your guidance building the fact that you are going to ramp production to replenish inventories at distribution as well? Dave Zinsner Well, as we indicated, we thought some of the drivers in the gross margin from the next quarter would be from utilization, a higher utilization this quarter versus last quarter, but we are also fundamentally lowering the cost per unit. Well start to see more benefits from the closures of the two facilities. So that will help as well. Jerry Fishman We tend to work very closely with the distributors to keep the inventory in weeks at about a constant rate. Certainly if the sell through in distribution keeps going up the dollars of inventory distribution will go up and that will low utilization a little bit, but thats we are trying to keep the weeks or the turns in distribution about constant as we have over the last couple of quarters. Thats how we deal with distributors and thats how we are planning to continue to deal with them in the coming quarters. Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird Right. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Thanks guys. Nice job on the gross margins. With margins above 60%, what options do you have as you look ahead given the tailwinds on utilization, mix, what have you, with either new end markets or new application penetration? Jerry Fishman Well, we continue at Analog despite our better focus to have a lot of irons in the fire and I think what we are going to continue to do is invest in the things that we are investing in. Thats sort of occupying most of our bandwidth. We think if we execute on those things we can have a pretty attractive growth rate. We are going to talk a little bit about this in more detail about at the analyst meeting next month here in Boston of what the segments are, where the growth drivers are, and so on. But I think the the thing we are going to really try to do is just keep focused on the things that we are committed to and I think as we do that, we execute, I think the growth rate will take care of itself. Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Okay. And then its the followup. Dave, you mentioned an action that triggered $11.5 million charge in the fiscal first quarter. How many other efficiency actions like that do you foresee as you look out over fiscal 10? Dave Zinsner Well, you know, its hard to predict. I would say that we are not really anticipating any additional actions like that. But I do think that there are things we can do on the infrastructure side to continue to more efficiently spend our money that will help offset some of the increases well see on the variable comp side and will help us fund other development actions that we might want to take advantage of. Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Okay, thanks guys and nice job. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong Wells Fargo Thank you very much. Your guidance, does that include restructuring charges or are you assuming there won't be restructuring charges in the coming quarters? Dave Zinsner We are assuming there won't be restructuring charges in the coming quarters. David Wong Wells Fargo So, your OpEx does go up by a fair amount equal at least offset that whole of restructuring charges $16.5 million is that right? Dave Zinsner Its not going to go back, $16.5 million, is that what you are asking? David Wong Wells Fargo Right, okay. And my second question, have you been able to supply product for the increase in demand youve seen in all areas or are there some segments or product types where there are shortages? Jerry Fishman In general, we are able to supply pretty much all of our products. I think I mentioned the statistic that to our OEM customers, which are about half of our sales, our largest customers, our lead times are within six weeks. And I think thats where we like them to be. And thats where they are. So, we dont really have a lot of shortages going on in the product group. David Wong Wells Fargo Right. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with Broadpoint AmTech. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Hi guys, given I am playing ping pong between two calls, I hope I dont step on a landmine here, but has anybody gone into the details on what caused the other section of Analog to be down 22%, can you give us a little insight into whats happening there? Jerry Fishman It was mostly to do with consumer products and that tends to bounce around a lot with the quarter to quarter numbers. So I dont think there is any real data there. If you look at the history of that thing, it bounces around quite a bit because its much more sort of market specific and customer specific products as compared to the broader categories. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Okay and is a fair amount in that business still coming from the MEMS segment and are you guys still pretty bullish on your MEMS outlook? Jerry Fishman Yes, I mean there is a lot of the MEMS products are in there. That tends to be very lumpy quarter to quarter. The previous quarter we had a very large one-up in that business as a result of a particular program that won very large customer and he bought enough for the whole next couple of quarters because it was a ramp of a new product he had. And we didnt get much business on that last quarter, but our position with that customer for the future is very, very good. So, its mostly, as I said, lumpy demand, heavily consumer, and thats why you saw those numbers. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Great. And then if I could one last one sort of trying to focus on end market demand. Are you guys able to see if the demand spectrum is broadening? Are you seeing a larger number of customers coming in and ordering or are you just seeing demand from your existing customer base return to a more normal levels? Jerry Fishman I think its a pretty broad based at least as we are hearing through the distributors we are . And I can't really say if its if theyve increased their customer base or what the exact details are the order patterns. But you know we are seeing it in new products and old products, we are seeing it in just across the board in many, many different product areas. And so I really dont know the specifics of that if there is any real data in the are there more customers or the same customers because I just dont know. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Alright. I guess may last one, are you feeling or thinking that there is any impact to any of your end markets from supply constraints in one direction or another? Jerry Fishman Well, we always worry about that with some of the lead times out there in the industry are pretty long and you always worry a little bit about is is that causing people to buy everything faster than they normally would, but we are trying to keep pretty good track of that and its not obvious that thats really impacting things a lot although thats something we always worry about and we watch it pretty carefully and well have to wait and see how that develops. But its certainly not what the customers are saying to us and what our distributors are saying to us. So but, on the other hand, we are always the last to note. So its really hard to predict it. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Alright. Terrific and congratulations on strong results. Jerry Fishman Thank you. Operator There appear to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Zinsner, Mr. Fishman, do you have any closing remarks? Dave Zinsner Yes, so thanks for participating. We are looking forward to talking to all of you again at our analyst day and just as a remainder thats scheduled for March 11th, 2010, and it will begin at 7:30 AM Eastern. So have a good day.

With that, lets begin with the opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerry Fishman Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today on todays second quarter earnings call. As you can tell from the press release we put out earlier the second quarter was just a great quarter for ADI. Our revenues grew about 11% sequentially, 41% year-over-year to $668 million which is above our recent peak we achieved in 2008.  Our earnings per share grew at a rate more than three times the rate of revenue growth for a record $0.55 per share for the quarter. As we described to many of our investors at the beginning of last year, we set a goal to fundamentally improve ADIs operating model and obviously we have made significant progress towards achieving that goal. In the second quarter our gross margins reached record levels increasing 390 basis points sequentially to 65% and our operating margins ran up to 32% which is over 700 basis points higher than our recent peak.  Because of our strong financial performance and our very strong cash flow our board has approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend to now $0.22 per share. Our industrial revenues were particularly strong and increased by over 20% sequentially as industrial activity picked up worldwide. Automotive revenues also increased substantially. Consumer and communications revenues were approximately flat sequentially. Revenues increased overall in the United States, Europe and Asia and declined slightly in Japan. I will elaborate a little bit more on the end markets and some of the trends in each of the markets after Dave discusses the financial results in a bit more detail.  I think very importantly we continue to be recognized in the industry as the premier analog supplier. In January Huawei, one of Chinas top telcom companies and one of our largest customers awarded ADI their Golden Core Supplier Award to ADI for delivering superior performance, technology, quality, responsiveness and in delivery. In March one of the industrial automation leaders, Rockwell, named ADI the Electronics Supplier of the Year for 2009. It is very noteworthy that ADI was the only semiconductor company to be recognized with this award from Rockwell.  These are just two examples of the recognition we are receiving across our customer base for our innovative signal processing solutions that give our customers a very significant competitive advantage coupled with our superior customer service and responsiveness to our customers needs.  Now I am going to turn the call over to Dave Zinsner who will provide a little more detail about our financial results.  Dave Zinsner  Thanks Jerry. As Jerry mentioned revenues in the second quarter grew 11% sequentially and 41% from the same quarter last year to $668 million. We responded to the significant increases in demand over the past few quarters while keeping our lead times short.  During the second quarter we shipped nearly 100% of our orders from direct customers within 4-8 weeks and nearly 90% of our orders from distributors within 4-8 weeks. This is similar to our lead times during the first quarter for OEM customers and only slightly longer for distributors where our ordering patterns tend to be more volatile.  In our view our ability to deliver quickly and reliably has three significant benefits. First, we believe in the current environment our lead times are winning us cross over business from competitors. Second, we believe over the long term ADI will continue to gain share since customers are confident in ADIs ability to meet its commitments to them in a volatile environment. Lastly, we believe that ADIs short and steady lead times should reduce the likelihood of double ordering that typically results from extended lead times providing us a somewhat more accurate picture of end demand.  Gross margins for the second quarter increased to 65%, up 390 basis points sequentially and also up 390 basis points from the last time our revenues were in the $660 million range which was during the fourth quarter of 2008. This margin increase is primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs derived from the manufacturing consolidations we completed last year, higher manufacturing utilization and to a lesser degree our richer mix of higher margin products used in industrial applications.  Our inventory levels remain within our stated range of 90-100 days at 97 days cost of sales, up only $4 million sequentially. Our distributor days of inventory declined slightly. At approximately 8 weeks it continues to be healthy and at historically low levels. Our deferred income on shipments to distributors is up approximately 17% sequentially reflecting much higher sales in distribution combined with significantly higher gross margins which further increased our deferred income.  Internal fab utilization rose about 10 percentage points to approximately the low 70s of production rated capacity. In line with better than expected revenue growth we have raised our capital spending plans slightly to approximately $95 million for the year. Longer term we can add substantial capacity to existing clean rooms if needed with a relatively low level of additional capital equipment.  Operating expenses were $220 million with the most significant increases in variable compensation driven by significantly higher operating margins and also higher sales commissions. Operating expense as a percentage of sales have declined from 36.3% at the end of fiscal 2008 to 33% of sales in the second quarter as we are now operating the business with 7% less non-manufacturing personnel. In addition, our strategy has been to increase the percentage of our operating expenses that are variable so we can more effectively modulate these expenses in response to future business cycles.  Operating margins increased to 32% of revenues. The last time our revenues were at current levels operating margins were less than 25% of sales. 720 basis points lower than in our recently completed quarter. This quarters substantially higher operating margins are partly due to an improving business environment but equally important our results reflect the actions we have taken over the past few years to better focus our investments and improve our execution and our cost structure.  Our tax rate was 21.9% which was up from 20.3% last quarter as we now estimate our annual tax rate to be 21.3% excluding the effect of restructuring expenses. We have also carefully managed our working capital. In addition to keeping our inventory within our stated range, day sales outstanding has remained in check at 45 days despite a tighter credit environment worldwide.  Cash flow from operations totaled $278 million or 42% of revenues and free cash flow was $261 million or 39% of revenues. Our cash balance now totals approximately $2.4 billion or $2 billion net of debt which is more than $200 million higher than the previous quarter and more than $700 million higher than the previous year.  In summary, by every financial and business metric this was a very successful quarter for ADI. I will now turn the call back over to Jerry who will discuss the results from each of the end markets.  Jerry Fishman  For the third consecutive quarter now we see strong sequential growth from the industrial market. For this quarter industrial revenues grew about 20% sequentially to about $316 million which is a very positive sign for recovery in this broad and diversified industry group.  The growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by growth in the industrial automation and instrumentation markets but every application area within the industrial category also showed sequential improvement. All regions had good growth in industrial products with particular strength in industrial products in Europe and in North America.  Our revenues from our automotive customers were approximately $84 million for the quarter which was up 14% quarter-over-quarter. Although certainly the growth of the automotive industry has been helped to some degree by the stimulus programs, feedback from many of our automotive customers indicating their belief that improving overall demand has also been the result of the gradual and steady improvement in consumer confidence.  Further ADI technology is most relevant to higher end cars which have not been the primary beneficiary of most government stimulus programs. Finally, we continue to see very favorable macro trends for ADI within the automotive space including safety, fuel efficiency and convenience, all of which drive higher dollar content for ADI.  Our communications revenues at about $133 million for the quarter were down very slightly from Q1. Networking applications, optical, microwave and satellite increases were offset by a decline in wireless revenues primarily as a result of delays in base station programs in China. For Q3 based on current ordering patterns and the backlog we have in place we expect growth from our Chinese base station customers. European and U.S. base station sales increased during the second quarter.  The wire line market had its fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement delivering good return on the very significant investments that we have made over the past few years in applications such as optical communications and also cable. This quarter revenues from wired communication applications were up approximately 20% sequentially. Revenues from the consumer market were about $120 million which was up a couple of percent from the previous quarter but up about 45% from last year.  We saw a particular strength in the digital camera and portable media markets and our customers today are indicating consumers are once again buying these types of products. In the computing sector our revenues increased 15% sequentially which still represents only a modest 2% of our total revenues.  The new orders for the quarter were again very strong in the second quarter. As a result of backlog for shipment in the third quarter increased from both OEM customers and distribution end customers and the book to bill ratio for the quarter was well above 1. Looking ahead to the third quarter given a higher backlog we are expecting continued revenue growth.  We are currently planning for our revenues to be in the range of $695-715 million for the third quarter. We expect this growth to be fairly broad based and that is based on our customer forecasts and the opening backlog we had starting this quarter. We are planning for our gross margins to be in a range of 65-66%. We are expecting operating expenses to grow as a result of higher variable comp as the operating margins continue to expand. The quarter OpEx growth is planned to be well below our anticipated revenue growth in the third quarter giving us additional leverage in the third quarter.  As a result we anticipate our operating margins will expand to the 33-34% range and earnings per share should be in a range of $0.59 to $0.61. Obviously we are very pleased with our operating performance both in terms of our growth and our profitability in the second quarter. We have fundamentally and significantly improved our operating margin structure at ADI without sacrificing sales growth opportunities which has been our goal for the past few years as we sharpened our strategic focus and we reduced costs company-wide.  We believe we still have additional leverage ahead of us as we fully recognize the benefits of lower unit costs, continue to experience good price stability in most of our products and we limit expense growth to a fraction of sales growth and continue to develop very innovative products that help our customers gain share in the markets they serve and command good margins. While the external world of course remains uncertain we are today a fundamentally better and a fundamentally stronger company than a few years ago. We believe as we continue to demonstrate world-class financial returns and above market growth our shareholders will be the beneficiary ultimately of this success.  Mindy Kohl  Thank you Jerry. During todays Q&amp;A period please limit yourself to one primary question and no more than one follow-on question. We will give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we are now ready for questions from our analyst participants.    Question and Answer Session Operator  The first question comes from the line of Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech.  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech As much as I hate to ask the hypothetical question, you mentioned in your commentary the company has increased its flexibility to the spending the company does in regards to the cycle. With these stocks not really able to get moving here it is clear that people recognize business is strong but my question really is hypothetically if you were to see revenues decline by 10% what impact would that have to the earnings potential for the company?  Dave Zinsner  I dont think I want to go right into the measuring because it depends on mix and things like that. I can tell you what we have done is changed the balance of the OpEx between what is variable and what is fixed. So as revenues if they were to decline we have an ability to maintain a lot more of the profits to the P&amp;L and hopefully keep the margin relatively balanced.  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech If you could focus on one segment you think you are seeing much better than expected demand from, not really customers trying to do an inventory rebuild. Where is it that the demand is surprising you to the upside?  Jerry Fishman  I would say probably the place it has been the strongest are in the industrial and automotive side. At least for this part of the seasonal lift. Typically our second quarter is a strong industrial quarter but I think the industrial part of the business has recovered quicker than we would have expected. It is above where it was at the peak of the last cycle but not by that much and it is spread out amongst so many customers, in that space probably 10,000 plus customers, so I dont think there is a broad inventory accumulation cycle going on.  That business was down very substantially last year, well over 30%, and I think what has happened is when we talk to the large customers; the Rockwells in the U.S. and their counterparts in Europe and China, I think they are seeing the fact their factories are running higher than they did and their inventory levels have been very low. I think they are predicting this is not really a bubble. You never know, as you well know, about what your customers are really doing but we dont get a lot of sense from the large customers that they are stockpiling inventory here.  It would be very surprising on a customer base as broad as this both by product, customer and geography that all of these customers would be acting in unison to build inventory. I think they are recovering some of the inventory that they depressed but I think they are ordering commensurate with what they think their outlook is at least for the next six months. As we look at the third quarter we are predicting that industrial revenues will grow again.  We have looked at this from the large customers, small customers, distributors and at least the sense we get fairly broadly across the board is that business has recovered quicker than we would have thought but not to levels we would have predicted they would recover to. The automotive stuff is the part that there is obviously some of that stimulus stuff which could [have] more people buying cars but I dont think at least what we hear from our guys that run that business that a huge amount of the increases we have seen are due to that. Most of our products as I mentioned in my opening comments are in the higher end cars. That is not going to benefit too much from the stimulus stuff. But our content for each car and safety stuff and sensors, and all the products we have been working on for a couple of years is just much higher than it was a couple of years ago.  We dont have a sense of automotive companies stockpiling inventory either. First of all, I dont think they want to. Secondly, I dont think they have the cash to. Those are the two segments probably that have surprised us most on the upside.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates. Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the com business in more detail. As I look back over the past number of years it seems sort of flattish dollar wise. Maybe some classification changes there or something. You obviously said there was some 20% growth there in the wire line business but overall it still is sort of flattish. Can you talk about how that might roll out over the coming year? Do you think we can see better growth going forward out of that?  Jerry Fishman  This is in communications?  Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates Overall communications.  Jerry Fishman  I think you know that business is obviously a very large customer business and when one customer does well often you see that customer flatten it out for awhile. Clearly the part we were really disappointed in this quarter was a few of our large customers in China we actually saw a decline this quarter which was anomalous to that business mainly because there was some well publicized push outs in China capital spending in the communications business. I think as we go forward we have looked at the order book pretty carefully particularly over the last month or so. Based on the orders we have on the books from our customers in China we expect we are going to have third quarter be a good growth quarter in the business in China.  Even during all of the ups and downs in the wireless market over the last couple of quarters the non-[China] business has continued to grow. So I mean we have a very solid position. We are the largest market share holder in Asia, Europe and the United States. If anything I think our share is better than it was 2-3 years ago. So I think as that business ebbs and flows with capital spending and inventory cycles with those customers I think the wireless communications part of the business is going to continue to be a good growth driver for us in the coming years.  It tends to be a little lumpy for sure but what I tend to pay attention to the most is the feedback we are getting from the customers about our position, how we are doing. The award we got from Huawei was a great substantiation of the fact we have an enormously strong position and one of the strongest players in the base station business in the world. We also have very strong positions in other very significant players; Ericsson and [inaudible]. So I think we have a very good balance and we have a very strong position which is going to continue to have that business be a good business for us a long time in the future if we keep executing.  Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates You took the dividend up. Obviously feeling a lot better about cash flow. I think you had raised some debt to maybe ensure that back when things were pretty ugly. I am curious now that cash flow is obviously better and you are taking up the dividend, will you also choose to pay down the debt or do you keep that for awhile? Can you talk to that?  Dave Zinsner  We have a few years yet before we have to decide on the debt. At this point we have plenty of cash in the U.S. and we have plenty of cash worldwide and so we are certainly not in need of any cash. The focus of the dividend was really to represent what we think is a very strong cash flow model for the company going forward and we seek to provide some of that back to the shareholders in the form of a dividend.  Jerry Fishman  I think also the debt is very low cost. We swapped it to floating rates which turned out to be at least for now a good thing to do. So the net cost for that debt is extremely low. We havent decided but it is not a high priority for us right now.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities.  Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities On the gross margin in terms of Q2 do you expect your utilization rate to increase as well? In terms of the long-term operating model you highlighted at your analyst day it looks going into Q2 you will be above the high end of the range. Is there any change in your mind in terms of the longer-term operating model? How should we think about that evolving over the next year or so?  Jerry Fishman  I think as far as utilization, utilization will bump up slightly in the quarter. As far as long-term models lets get to where we said we were going to get to first and then we will talk about that some more. We are obviously very optimistic about our prospects going forward but I would like to see another quarter before we get into that conversation.  Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities In the supply chain inventory it sounds like things are still a little bit on the lean side. Are there any end markets or areas where you are seeing inventories at a normal level?  Jerry Fishman  At a normal or abnormal?  Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities At a normal level just because it seems like a lot of areas are a little bit on the lean side.  Jerry Fishman  I really dont know that enough to be definitive in a comment on that. Most of the comments we get about inventory from our customers are anecdotal. The inventories we really understand the best are what is in distribution but beyond distribution we dont know where it is going. So it is very hard to answer that question accurately and definitively.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely JP Morgan.  Christopher Danely JP Morgan A different way to ask that question, can you give us a sense of what utilization rates are and maybe what the incremental gross margin is as the utilization rates go higher?  Dave Zinsner  The current utilization for the second quarter was in the low 70s. I think I even mentioned that. It likely will be going into the mid 70s so not a significant increase in utilization but that is going to be a benefit to our gross margins. Really the bigger driver for gross margins I think in the next quarter is going to be additional cost reductions associated with the fab consolidations.  Christopher Danely JP Morgan In terms of the strength in the industrial and auto in particular what would you describe would be the major factors of the strength? Do you think there is still some inventory replenishment out there? Is it share gains? Is it increasing content? Is it a mix of all three? Is there something else in there? Maybe highlight one or two of the biggest factors you think are driving that.  Jerry Fishman  I think it is all of those things probably in some ratio we dont really know definitively. One of the interesting things and we talked about this a little at the analyst meeting we had a couple of months ago is there are some new segments in the industrial area that are growing pretty rapidly that we are very well penetrated in. I think I also mentioned that or the [guy] who runs our industrial business mentioned that his goal is he really believes the industrial market could provide as much or more growth than any other market segment we are in given the growth rates in some of these segments.  I think the old story that the industrial market was a [sweet deal] market and it is going to grow 2% a year, the real excitement is in cell phones and consumer products is the only place with any growth I think it is going to turn out to be fallacious.  I think there is significant opportunities in the industrial business and I think also the automotive business where just the electronics changing and just more and more signal processing content in automotive products and industrial products and there is great opportunities for growth there just like there are in every other market segment. I think when history is written, at least for ADI, we are making our investments in the industrial or the automotive business, I am not speaking broadly for all semiconductor companies but just for ADI I think it will turn out the industrial business does hold its own relative to anything else we are doing on the growth side.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank.  Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank  A question on the gross margin side. You mentioned some of the lower costs from the fab closures was in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how much that added in the April quarter and how much is left as we go forward?  Dave Zinsner  It was meaningful. It has been meaningful now for the last few quarters. It is a combination of the consolidation of the 6 inch line in Limerick into the 8 inch which we completed midway through last year. At the end of the year we closed down Cambridge and we are already starting to see some benefit. We saw some benefit in the second quarter. We will see more benefit in the third quarter. Those are the things that are really the big drivers of our gross margin leverage right now.  Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank  I believe in the past you talked about the Cambridge side was about $40 million in savings. Do you have any kind of rough ballpark how much of that you have already seen and how much is left to be benefited from?  Dave Zinsner  Rough order of magnitude I think we have got roughly about 1/3 of it. There is probably 2/3 left.  Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank  On the revenue side of the equation everybody is clearly nervous about too much inventory and things have been good for awhile to come. Can you talk about the turns you did in the April quarter and any sort of turns assumption you have whether it is increasing or decreasing in conservatism for your July quarter guidance?  Dave Zinsner  One thing you have to remember is when we are looking at backlog we are looking at backlog placed on us. So the distributor backlog tends to not be a great measure. So we have to kind of, we do a lot of different analysis to come up with a number that we predict for revenue. We hardly ever look at this number I would tell you. But it ran a little less than 40% in the second quarter. It is probably going to be a little bit even lower than that. We are getting a fair amount of visibility obviously from our distributors.  Jerry Fishman  The opening backlog is up quite a bit. I think as Dave said the backlog distributors place on here is not indicative of anything. So we dont really, I mean look at that very carefully. We look at what distributors are actually selling through and we look at what the large OEM customers are telling us and that is how we come up with the guidance.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen Citigroup.  Terence Whalen Citigroup On the device revenue performance it seems like you had very strong performances from amplifiers and RF as well as from power management and some of the other analog signal processing circuits. It seems like data converters grew a little bit less, about 5% sequentially. I was wondering what contributed to that? Was it end market mix? Do you have any observations in general about the data converter market competition?  Dave Zinsner  One thing you might not want to misread is just one quarters performance in data converter. Data converters has been up every quarter since the second quarter of last year sequentially. So where some of these other product areas have kind of been up and down a little bit through the year, data converters had very, very steady improvement since Q2 of last year. So I think on a peak to trough or peak to peak analysis or what have you, you will see that data converters is actually doing really well.  Jerry Fishman  On the question on the competition, I think there is a lot of competition out there. It is a great market and we have 40 plus percent of it and everybody wants it. There are a lot of people that have been investing a lot in the converter market and so on. I think when you look at all the statistics and you listen to the customers which are the ultimate statistic I think that is a great business and it is probably one of the best market segments in the analog space. It is one of the very few that the shares are concentrated as it is in the converter market. There is every bit of evidence our share over the last couple of years has gone up despite all of the competitive noise out there and it is certainly the highest priority we have is to keep that high or even increase it in future quarters. I think based on what I have seen we are doing in that business I think we have a good chance of doing that.  Terence Whalen Citigroup Regarding your commentary about distributor inventory I think the past three quarters you have said it is about 8 weeks. You said it went down actually fractionally but not enough to be a half week or so. Can you kind of help me understand that comment in light of the deferred income to distribution at 17%? I know if I normalize for gross margin that comes out to only about a 10% growth. Am I to understand that distributor revenues grew over 10% sequentially to drive distributor days down?  Dave Zinsner  Distributor revenues were higher than the corporate average and OEM was lower than the corporate average. You are correct. That is what drove it.  Terence Whalen Citigroup In general, the level of distribution inventory, do you expect that to have to go up at some point or is this the new normal?  Dave Zinsner  I think they are trying to keep it within that kind of 8 week range. It slipped a little bit and that is based on just the fact they have been ramping and so there is a little bit of a lag to keep pace with that.  Jerry Fishman  I think we are also trying to keep it in that range. We have an interest in not putting too much inventory in the channel. When we get orders placed on us which are not things we look at very closely we have a lot of dialogue with those distributors about, what is the sell through, why do you want it, so on and so forth. I think we have a very significant stake in keeping our inventories at reasonable levels. We dont get any revenue credit for it but we would confuse everybody if we dont do that. By the way, capacity is more scarce [inaudible] so the last thing we want to do is use capacity to just put inventory on distributor shelves beyond what their sell through is. We just dont do that.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Jim Covello Goldman Sachs.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs I want to drill down even a bit further on the gross margin thing that I know has been probed on a little bit. I know Dave you talked about utilization and you made the comments of where it is and where it is going. Then you said about 1/3 of the last fab closure is baked into the numbers and 2/3 is still to come. Can you give us a sense of how much maybe on a basis point impact that 2/3 left is having on the margins? Then I think Jerry mentioned pricing is the other margin leverage in his closing comments. Do you need prices to go up to have margin leverage or are your costs coming down enough so if prices stay flat or only go down a little bit there is incremental margin leverage there as well?  Dave Zinsner  There is still about 100 basis points of benefit still coming from fab closures.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Is that all coming in the next quarter or is that to be spread out over the next couple of quarters?  Dave Zinsner  Spread out probably over a couple of quarters.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs The pricing leverage?  Jerry Fishman  We always watch pricing. We have very high value added products and we are always in the mode of making sure we get paid for the product commensurate with the value they create. We are not anticipating wholesale price increases to maintain or improve our margins across the board. We always have opportunities on older products and so on to think about that because we are one of the very few or only company that supports semiconductor products for 20 years or more after we introduce them, which is a great value to our customers.  I think the direct answer to your question is we are not anticipating any significant price increases to either maintain or raise our margins.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Relative to the power management business that is something that got discussed quite a bit maybe 9-12 months ago. Obviously with the business being so robust now maybe there is not as much urgency for kind of new growth opportunities. But where is your head on that potential avenue for growth looking forward?  Jerry Fishman  I think it is still good. The whole challenge for ADI in the power business has been to focus on areas where we really have unique stuff. We have gone through a metamorphosis a year or two ago to better focus it towards particularly applications where we already have a very significant control of the billed materials.  I think the group out there has responded well to that and I think we have begun already to see the benefits of better focus in that business. It improved significantly last quarter. One quarter does not make a business one way or the other but I think there are a lot of indicators in there that if we focus, I mean we are not taking on the broad power business trying to compete across a $7 billion with entrenched competitors. We are looking for opportunities where we can do something unique and where we have a large control over the billed materials. I think if we do that and we stay true to that strategy I think we will do very well in that business.  Operator The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer Credit Suisse.  John Pitzer Credit Suisse  I guess I am going to go back to a comment I think Jerry made in the opening comments about your short lead times allowing you to gain some market share. I was hoping you could quantify that a little bit. Is that the main driver why some of the other businesses outside of converters grew more quickly sequentially? Are those share gains you think sustainable?  Jerry Fishman  I would say quarter-to-quarter it is very hard to make that judgment. I think the [crossover] business is not significant relative to our total sales but it is significant I think relative to our reputation. So I think the more important victory here, if there is one, is customers come to us and we can supply the stuff. Certainly the conversations we have had with our sales force is we wouldnt expect to be losing that business when other competitors start to deliver again. There is no reason for that. I think a lot of that business is going to stick and I think it is going to increase in future quarters.  It is not meaningful relative to $650-700 million of sales but it is very relevant to the perception of Analog as a supplier. I think that is the more important take away from this.  John Pitzer Credit Suisse  Going back to the deferred shipment line, understanding you need to adjust that sequential growth number for gross margins but even when I do that you are still kind of back to peak revenue levels but deferred shipments are above that level. Just help me understand why I shouldnt be worried that is some sort of yellow flag that there might be some inventory building. Is there a change in the business where you are just going to be running with higher deferred shipments going forward? How would you expect that to trend over the next few quarters?  Dave Zinsner  One thing you have to remember is that the cost of the inventory being held at distribution is not necessarily the same. In other words, the gross margins arent exactly the same change for the total company as they are for that. So, the gross margin has actually improved a bit more at the disti level than they did for the total company over the peak to peak period of time. So that is driving a lot of it. I think you will find, and I am pretty sure when I did the analysis that the days of inventory are actually lower than they were by a good 10 days or so from the Q4 2008 period. We have pretty good accurate assessments of that.  John Pitzer Credit Suisse  So it is all being driven just by better profitability on your part?  Dave Zinsner  That, plus I think that disti is now back to levels where they are shipping at a fairly decent rate.  Jerry Fishman  It turns out companies like Analog the distribution margins are usually higher because the volumes we ship out are much lower and the customer base is much more fragmented. That is the more profitable part of our business. It is also the part that services the industrial market mostly. All those things add up to the fact that business tends to be higher margins than anything else we do.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company.  Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Cycling back to gross margin, nice tailwinds in utilization and in factory shutdown and consolidation activity. Are there any headwinds at play? For example, last year consumer grew at well above average rate in the second half of the year. Anything like that going on?  Dave Zinsner  Our anticipation is that mix will impact the third quarter by a little bit but mix in either direction quarter-to-quarter tends to be well below a point and we have enough things going the other direction in terms of utilization and cost reductions that we are able to offset those and more. We are not very concerned about gross margins and our ability to get leverage.  Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company A utilization related question, I think we would typically expect analog companies to run at utilization levels in the low to mid 80s and the company is moving back towards the mid 70s but how do you look at utilization here? Do you view it as something that can move up and be run in the mid 80s percent range or is there a reason we should expect ADIs utilization level to really hover in the mid 70s range?  Jerry Fishman  I think it has the opportunity to move up a little bit. As Dave said we have increased capital spending slightly to make sure we are right about this. I think the important take away on that is for relatively small amounts of incremental capital we can add capacity both cheaply and quickly. So the capacity additions we are putting on are really incremental in nature. Our goal is to keep our lead times low and that is what we are going to do in the absence of something cataclysmic happening on the top line on the upside, that is where we are going to be.  Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Is the incremental spending on the capital side, the uptick in guidance for the year on the front end or the back end or both?  Jerry Fishman  It is both. We are incrementally making more investments to get more internal wafers out. We are also making investments in back end equipment to make sure we get the [wafers] out we can test them and go on. So it is really across the board. Again, for a company that is running $2.7 or $2.8 billion still our capital plan is below $100 million this year. I think we have become a lot less capital intensive and we can make given the footprint we have in our fabs we can make incremental investments and get a lot more unit growth out of there.  Operator The next question comes from the line of David Wong Wells Fargo.  David Wong Wells Fargo I know you dont want to give explicit guidance beyond the June quarter but can you help us understand the seasonality in the September quarter? If we look back several years in some years September is a decline sequentially and in other years it grows. Specifically can you give us a feel for what proportion of your revenues today come from end markets that seasonally decline in the September quarter?  Jerry Fishman  I think your comment earlier is probably one of [inaudible]. It is very challenging to figure out precise seasonality when the markets are so volatile. I dont think we have any better read on seasonally what happens in Q4 compared to the rest of the year. So we just dont know enough. Some years, as you say, go up and in some years they go down. Six months out we just dont have a good sense of what is going to drive that. The only thing we typically know is that our second quarter is usually our seasonally strongest quarter because it is more days in distribution than our first quarter which has holidays.  But beyond that it bounces around year to year based on mix, based on seasonality, based on inventory levels, based on so many things it is just very, very hard to predict and I think that is why we dont predict it.  David Wong Wells Fargo To try another question with the elephant in the room, any signs of any weakening in demand from European end markets at this point?  Jerry Fishman  No.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research.  Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research On OpEx, now that you are at basically back or exceeding previous peak revenue levels would it be fair to say at this point that all of the temporary OpEx cuts you were discussing before have now returned and all of the permanent cuts at this point have actually been completed? Are you basically at the right OpEx model you have been targeting? Are there any more I guess further, is there any more further fat I guess to take out?  Jerry Fishman  We are at the model we put out at about 33% of sales. As I think Dave or I mentioned in the coming quarters we are planning to grow OpEx a lot less than our record assuming the revenues come through that we expect. So I think we will get some more OpEx leverage in future quarters. I think the thing that is noteworthy on the OpEx line is we have long had a plan at Analog that incented all of our employees to get our operating margins up quite a bit. What you have seen is the rise in OpEx over the last couple of quarters is primarily the result of that success.  It is not a trivial exercise to put on 700 points of operating leverage from last time we were at these kinds of levels. I think the pressure continues to keep moving the margins up at the company. The payback for employees doing that has been quite high. Of course the margin has been on a very steep incline. Even though we expect the margins to improve in future quarters we dont expect or at least we are not anticipating to add another 700 basis points on the margins in the short-term.  I think certainly the rate of acceleration of that is going to go down quite a bit. We are going to try and control the OpEx to a fraction of revenue growth rate. So the answer to your question is we still think we have more OpEx leverage coming up in the future.  Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research A quick follow-up on the RF business. I know the amplifier and RF business looks like it was up quite considerably, about 16% quarter-over-quarter. My understanding was a fair amount of the RF piece of this was actually the communication infrastructure. It looks like it was down a little bit. I know this was a big, key strategic focus of yours that you talked about on the analyst day. Could you just give us a little bit of color on what you are seeing in the RF business in particular I guess in light of where it was in this quarter and also maybe outlook for the year?  Jerry Fishman  I think it is a great business for us. In the case of the analyst meeting we heard more in detail of the applications. It turns out it is a fair amount of RF in the wire line side of the business as well as the wireless side of the business and in other segments as well. I think we have a very broad product base in RF. We have great technology. The feedback we are getting from the customers in terms of growth and roadmaps to the future is very strong. I think that is going to be a very important business for us and we are doing extremely well at it right now.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech.  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech If you look at the R&amp;D tax credit getting extended what impact would that have on the tax rate going forward?  Dave Zinsner  You mean if it was approved?  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Yes.  Dave Zinsner  It is a percentage or two.  Mindy Kohl  That concludes our Q&amp;A session. Thank you all for your participation.

Next I'd ask you to please note that the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information which may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is May 17, 2011.  With that, let's begin with opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald Fishman Well, good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on today's ADI call. Our second quarter was a great quarter for ADI, of course, virtually every dimension of our business, with results that were way ahead of the earlier guidance that we provided last quarter. Revenues were $791 million, which were up almost 9% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by strength in industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure products, which increased sequentially by 14%, 12% and 7%, respectively. Sales of consumer products declined by 7% sequentially in Q2. Order rates were very strong in Q2 and our book-to-bill ratio was above one. Over the course of the quarter, orders were generally strong in February. They spiked in March in reaction to industry-wide uncertainty caused by the events in Japan and leveled off to more normal rates in April, which were in line with what we would normally expect on a seasonal basis. In managing ADI going forward, it's very critical that we carefully understand the upside that we experienced in Q2 and properly plan with that upside for the balance of 2011. Our best answer after analyzing all the data is that there are 3 principal factors that came into play in the second quarter. First, clearly the earthquake and tsunami in Japan resulted in less business for ADI in that region in Q2, as many factories were shut down and consumer demand dropped following these disastrous events in Japan. Secondly, the events in Japan likely caused an industry-wide acceleration of buying by customers to build some safety stock. Despite the fact that ADI's lead times remain short and we got very few product shortages, we believe that customers, some customers anyhow, had some proper inventory of ADI products during the quarter. While we don't believe that this was material to our results in Q2, it was nevertheless a factor. The net of those 2 opposing forces, in one sense Japan being weaker and the other sense some acceleration of orders in the second quarter, we estimate probably increased our second quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. However, it's important to note that even with this upside caused by these events, revenues would have been above the high end of the range that we communicated at the beginning of the quarter, indicating that the fundamental demand for our products is very strong. Lastly, our results were led by continuing strength in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure products, all markets which are growing and robust in most geographies and markets in which ADI is extremely well positioned. In addition, we have very little exposure to the computer market and to the low-end cellphone market, where competitive price pressures and uncertain demand patterns are certainly at the current time eliminating market progress. Our outlook for Q3, which I'll comment on a little bit later in the call, will take into account all of these factors.  So now I'll turn the call back to Dave, who'll provide a few more details about our second quarter financial results. David Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, second quarter revenues were $791 million, increasing 9% sequentially and 18% from last year. Gross margins were above guidance at 67.6% in the second quarter, a 140-basis-point improvement from the prior quarter and a record for the company. The increase in gross margins was driven by better utilization on higher sales and a favorable product mix.  Operating expenses for the second quarter were $236 million, a $13 million or 5.8% increase from the prior quarter. The increase was the result of a planned salary adjustment, the first in 3 years, which took effect at the beginning of the second quarter and other related costs, along with some modest strategic hiring. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined to 29.8% in Q2 compared to 30.6% of revenue in the prior quarter and 33% a year earlier.  Operating profits for the second quarter were $299 million or 37.8% of sales, up 220 basis points from 35.6% of sales in the prior quarter. Here again, operating margins are at record levels for the company. The increase in operating margins was the result of the higher sales, continued strength in gross margins and tightly controlled operating expenses. For the second quarter, operating profit increased sequentially by $39 million or 15% on a $62 million or 9% revenue increase. This represented a 63% drop-through of incremental revenue to operating profit. Other expense was approximately $1.7 million compared to $600,000 in the prior quarter. The increase was related to interest expense, which increased as a result of the $375 million 3% coupon bond that we issued on April 4.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was just over 22% this quarter, in line with expectations. We expect the tax rate to remain at approximately 22% next quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.78 and non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.75, excluding a onetime tax benefit. This compares to diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.70 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.66 in the prior quarter.  Our cash generation continues to be strong as we generated 25% of our revenues or $197 million in operating cash flow, and our cash balance now totals approximately $3.4 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion is in the U.S. Our Q2 cash balance includes the $375 million 3% bond I mentioned earlier. Net cash at the end of Q2 was approximately $2.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $34 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $163 million or 21% of revenue for the quarter. In addition, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares or $68 million worth of ADI stock in the second quarter. As a result of our strong financial performance and cash flow and our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase to ADI's quarterly dividend to $0.25 per outstanding share of common stock. This increased dividend will be paid on June 15 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 27. Our accounts receivable balance increased sequentially by approximately 8%, in line with our revenue growth, and our days sales outstanding remained flat to the prior quarter at 48 days. All of our customers are current to their terms. Inventory at the end of the second quarter increased by 4% sequentially and our days of inventory were 104 days compared to 105 days in the prior quarter. Our distributor inventory expressed in terms of days of inventory was up slightly, in line with distributors' more positive outlook on business conditions and remains at target levels of approximately 8 weeks.  Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in excellent control with 99% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 6 weeks. Overall, from a supply chain perspective, we have not experienced any material impact from the Japan earthquake and tsunami. We have no manufacturing facilities in Japan, have not experienced any shortages of raw silicone or processing and packaging materials and as our lead times show, we did an excellent job supplying to upside demand from our customers in the second quarter. In summary, by every financial and business metric, this was a very successful quarter for ADI.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, who will discuss the results from each of our end markets and provide our short-term outlook. Jerald Fishman Well, with regard to our market performance in the second quarter, in the second quarter, our revenues from the broad and diversified industrial market, which includes industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare, grew 14% sequentially, reaching a record level of $384 million. Our strong results were primarily driven by growth in the process control and instrumentation markets, with most other application areas within the industrial category showing sequential improvement as well. In addition, we saw strong sales both at our large OEM industrial accounts, as well as within our work base of smaller industrial accounts. In aggregate, industrial revenues represented 49% of our total revenues in Q2. Overall, we continue to believe that the industrial market offers significant long-term growth opportunities in line with ADI's overall corporate growth rate, driven by our customers' need for energy efficiency and higher performance in industrial automation and advanced instrumentation equipment, as well as an increasing trend to substitute capital for labor in modern factory build outs around the world. For the balance of 2011, we expect industrial sales to remain strong, a prediction that is supported by leading industrial customers who've reported that they believe underlying conditions in this market are very solid. For example, Siemens and ABB, which are 2 of ADI's major industrial customers, in their most earnings announcements reported double-digit increases in new orders, underscoring the strength in their respective businesses. We believe that ADI is very well positioned to benefit from the momentum that these and many other industrial customers continue to see. Revenues from our automotive customers were $106 million in the quarter, an increase of 12% sequentially from the first quarter. That would get another record for our Automotive business, which in Q2 represented approximately 13% of our total revenues. Leveraging our strengths along the signal chain and sensors and signal conditioning and data converters and in DSPs, ADI has developed a very compelling portfolio of solutions in the area of safety, entertainment and also power train electronics. In this portfolio, along with a more robust market in automotive worldwide, continues to drive our success. During Q2, safety systems represented a large portion of our business in automotive, with particularly strong sales in the area of stability control, which is a new large market opportunity for ADI technology. In addition, infotainment remained strong in the areas of hedge units and audio amplifier and in powertrain products, we experienced continuing success with our battery management products, achieving record revenue levels in Q2 with sales of key products such as our intelligent battery management solution which is used in lower emission vehicles. Looking ahead, we expect automotive to continue to be an important growth driver for ADI, and we believe that we'll continue to benefit from favorable macro trends within the automotive space in the areas of active and passive safety, entertainment and fuel efficiency, all of which together should continue to drive higher dollar content for ADI. Communications revenues at $176 million for the quarter were up 7% versus Q1 level. Sales to communications customers accounted for about 22% of our total sales in the quarter. During the second quarter, escalating the adoption of smartphones and the accompanying data growth, continued to drive cellular market expansion in Europe, in North America and also in China. For ADI, wireless infrastructure sales surged in Q2, driven by a strong base station demand as competing operators remain focused on aggressively expanding their capacity and their footprint. We believe that ADI will continue to benefit from this expansion as a result of the need for broadband high performance mixed signal radios and base stations and a point-to-point system. Less than 10% of our communications infrastructure revenues in Q2 were derived from TD-SCDMA equipment in China, which given the large sequential communications revenue increase we saw in Q2, really clearly demonstrates the underlying strength and most importantly, the breadth of ADI's position in the wireless infrastructure market worldwide. Our current estimates are that TD-SCDMA revenues will begin to increase in the second half of the year as TD-SCDMA deployments we hope resume in China. Wired communications, although down slightly quarter-over-quarter, were up year-over-year in Q2 and continued to trend upward on an annual basis. Though moderated to some degree by constraints on capital spending in the short term, we expect that the fundamental demand for higher wire traffic will continue to drive growth in this business for ADI over the longer term. Going forward, we expect that communications infrastructure will remain a key area of opportunity for ADI, driven by the explosion in mobile broadband data usage and continued mobile subscriber growth, pushing infrastructure capital spending to new high levels. In the second quarter, our consumer revenues were down 7% sequentially, primarily due to events in Japan as well as weaker consumer spending environments worldwide. Our Q2 revenues from consumer customers were $111 million and accounting for 14% of ADI's revenues. During the second quarter, increased revenues from portable consumer products partially offset weaker revenues in digital camera products, while home entertainment revenues were essentially flat, sequentially. And finally, our computer revenues were flat sequentially, but represented now just 2% of ADI's total revenue. As most of you are aware, the computing market is not a space where ADI is supplying almost any R&amp;D resource. So let me now turn it to the outlook for Q3. Overall, business was very strong for ADI in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, industry-wide uncertainty about supply related to the Japan disaster likely accelerated some demand, which is not expected to repeat in the third quarter. At the same time, our order trends were strong throughout Q2. And we're entering Q3 with a book-to-bill ratio above one and higher where we have opening backlog, which together indicates continuing growth in the demand for ADI's products. In addition, our customer forecast indicate continued strong demand for industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure products and also some recovery in consumer products, particularly in Japan. In aggregate, as a result of strength in our end markets coupled with our continuing ability to supply upside demand, we're now more optimistic about what we can achieve in 2011 than we were when the year began. As such, we're planning for our third quarter revenues to be in the range of $765 million to $795 million with a midpoint of about $780 million, which is above our original plan for Q3. We expect continuing strong gross margins in the range of 67% to 68%. We expect operating expenses to be flat-to-down slightly sequentially. We believe that this should result in earnings from continuing operations in a range of $0.70 to $0.75, which were also above our original plan for the third quarter. In summary, I'm very pleased with where ADI is today and also where we're headed. Our heightened focus, coupled with secular strength in the markets that are strategic for ADI, is producing above market growth rates and makes such that the margin more optimistic about achieving the long-term growth rates that we've projected. Clearly the benefits of strategically focusing our R&amp;D on higher margin and sustainable markets is beginning to pay off for ADI. And our fundamentally lower and more variable cost structure is resulting in one of the most profitable business models in the semiconductor industry to date with upside opportunity and some downside projection. Most importantly, our employees understand and support where we're headed and are enthusiastic about ADI's future and the role that they continue to play in our success. In a recently completed survey of our 8,500 employees around the world, we noted very significant improvements in virtually every category of employee understanding and employee satisfaction, which together are generally a very good leading indicator of our future success. By design, we're in the right places at the right times with a highly capable and energized workforce. And our growth in financial returns, which we believe will continue to drive superior returns for our shareholders, are indicative of the strength of this position. Mindy Kohl Thank you Jerry. During today's Q&amp;A period, please limit yourself to one primary question, and no more than one follow-up question. We'll give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we're now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co First question, a little longer term, can you just talk about the gross margin drivers for the rest of this year, and then maybe throw in what the utilization rates are right now? David Zinsner Sure. Well, let me start with utilization. Utilization was about 80% this quarter, and it was about 75% last quarter. That's likely to come down a little bit next quarter. We'll modulate our inventory build a little bit and we do have a shutdown planned over the July 4 holiday for the Wilmington site. Long term, I think obviously, at these gross margin levels, we're pretty pleased we certainly exceeded our original expectations that we provided to you in the Analyst Day back in early 2010. I think most of the driver going forward has a lot to do with revenue, both in terms of the absolute dollars of revenue driving margin expansion as well as if the utilization creeps up beyond the 80% levels we're at today. Jerald Fishman I think the other part of it that's really been fundamentally a better product mix that we've had over the last year or 2, so we've really increased our focus in the B2B space. And certainly, those markets provide proprietary gross margin opportunities in some of the other higher volume and much more competitive segments. So I think that the combination of the utilization -- we have the factories properly sized that we can get the upside that we need, even though we had $30 million or $40 million more revenues than we thought we were going to have, but yet we have extremely low costs in those factories. So I think it's really a combination of it. Certainly if utilization creeps up, the gross margin should respond well to that. And certainly as the product mix continues to evolve more towards the B2B space of the business-to-business base, I think that could have some positive drivers as well. So as Dave said, we were wondering about a year ago if we could sort of get past the 63%, 64% area on gross margins. I think now we're comfortably above that, and we're looking around for continuing opportunities to move that. So we'll have to see how that goes, but those are the primary drivers. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co And for my follow-up, just a little more color on Japan. If you guys could, can you estimate how much of the weakness is due to demand versus, is anything on the supply constraints side? And then how did you guys arrive at the $20 million number? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, first of all, there was a word in front of the $20 million that said approximately, so this is not a scientific calculation about that. What we did is we looked at some of the -- our logistics group and the people we're servicing the customers looked at customers that they know pulled some orders in and we made some estimates on others and we came up with that number based on the best guess we have from looking at our large customers and our small customers. By definition, it's a very complicated number because we serve 60,000 customers around the world in all these different countries that are all going through different cycles. But I thought it was important to try to come up with an estimate of that to properly set the stage for Q3 and Q4 because there were some onetime things in Q2 when we want to try or at least put boundaries on that to help everybody understand what were the onetime benefits that we got and what we're sustaining, part of the growth curves that we're operating on is. So I mean, we don't have any -- we don't have a spreadsheet that adds up to plus or minus $10, obviously. We just have some guesses in the large and the small customers about what happened. The best guess we have is that the events in Japan and the Japanese market probably cost us $5 million or $10 million in revenues in Japan and the rest of it was upside that we got from other customers. So that's if we had to make a guess, that would be the guess of the balance that we saw. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co Okay, great. That's very helpful. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc The first question is a little bit high-level question regarding buyback. It seems like secularly, ADI is doing very well in end markets, having very good uptake of its products across a number of applications. And it appears based on the margins and the returns that you're generating that your stock looks cheap at these levels. I was wondering, given that you have a fairly large authorization, why weren't you more aggressive in the buyback this quarter? Jerald Fishman Well, a bunch of reasons. First of all, for a large part of this quarter, the world was a very uncertain place, and there were people that were projecting the world was going to come unglued. They couldn't get substrates, they couldn't get plastics, they couldn't get wafers and we were concerned about that as well early in the quarter, so we're a little bit more hesitant. The other part is, we just raised the cash balance in the U.S. We did a financing in early April to get a larger cash balance in the U.S. to give us more flexibility in the future to do that. Right now, based on the results, we decided to raise the dividend substantially as one indication of that. But I think that opportunistically, as we've said and we've proven in the past, we tend to be retro buyers of our stock when we think it's appropriate. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc Okay. And then as my follow-up, I was hoping that maybe Vincent or Robbie could chime in on what are maybe the 1 or 2 key take aways from progress on the reorganization of the sales and products groups a year and a half ago? I'm looking that their view on maybe 1 or 2 of the most positive and a sense of that, and also perhaps one setback that they've encountered as well. Vincent Roche Okay. Well, maybe I'll chime in on that one. I think there are 2 very, very tangible benefits we're seeing at this point. I think, one, the strategic planning process in terms of how we allocate the vital resources in terms of R&amp;D, our fuel resources and so on. We've gotten a lot more strategic clarity around now where it is that we want to play and how it is that we create the win for the company. And I think as well, we're just in terms of being able to engage with our critical customers, the key customers, in terms of really getting a granular understanding of their needs and being able to define products in a way that address those needs in the most aggressive and innovative way, those are 2 term benefits that I see at this point in time. Robert McAdam Yes. And I mean, I think it's about -- Robbie here. I think it's about having a much more clarity and certainty about our long-term strategies and knowing that we've got winning strategies and knowing where we don't, in fact, have changes. Jerald Fishman I'll throw an answer in on the hardest part of the question, the second half of your question, Terry. The hardest part, I think in this thing is, we have radically turned ADI upside down in the last couple of years. I mean, the numbers and the results we're getting are not just normal things that happen. So we've changed the strategic balance in the company tremendously on where we're putting money and where we're not. We've gotten out of businesses. We've increased investment in other businesses. We have virtually the top 30 people in the company in different jobs primarily than they had, including Vince and Robbie, I would say, than they had 18 months ago. And when you think an organization that is as large and complex as ADI and you try to transform it in the ways we have, both on the strategy side, on the operational efficiency side, on the cost side, we've changed direction on many, many things we were doing to get to where we've got. And it just takes time in the organization to get everybody around to that point of view. I mean, one of the reasons we did this survey that I mentioned earlier in my comments, and we really didn't exactly know what the results of that survey were going to be when we did it. So one of the reasons we did it is we really wanted to see if there was some really significant fundamental movement in the way people were thinking about what was going on in the company and what they saw what the issues are. I think the larger issue that people have seen as a result of that in private company is that they're from different jobs and they're adjusting to it, and it takes a while and their perspectives are different and they don't get to make some of the decisions that they used to make on their own without regard to what customers wanted and so on. So I think those are just things that we're pushing our way through. I was very pleased by the results we got in the survey. When we look at some of the numbers, I mean, people really believe things have changed here, and they're generally very enthusiastic about the change. I just wish, like always, it would happen faster. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc Very helpful color, Jerry. Jerald Fishman Unlike you guys, who give us long periods of time to see results. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc That's great. Operator And we have a question from the line of Uche Orji from UBS. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank This is Parag for Uche. Just had a question on your results on the outlook. Even if we adjust the impact from Japan, the polling for demand, your loss was better than many of your peers. So just one thing, is there any other dynamics that are at play, like, you're seeing any acceleration in combination of design wins or any industrial gain that you're seeing better revenue than your peers? Jerald Fishman Well, I think the third part of the mix of the quarter that I mentioned in the opening comments was we're doing extremely well in the B2B business right now. And for markets like industrial, where many people believed it was sort of a slow growth, stodgy market. And at last year's analyst meeting, we had the guy that runs our industrial business stand up and say that his goal was to grow that business as fast or faster than any of our other businesses and everyone sort of rolled their eyes and said that was not really possible. And I think I mentioned in one of the last couple of quarter calls that I really believed the guy and we're seeing that. There is usually industrialization going on in many countries in the world. There's a tremendous substitute of capital -- industrial capital for labor going on every place in the world. And the industrial business with a push on efficiency and so on is really creating great opportunities for our technology. And so I think when you look at that market, the infrastructure market, I mean, the reason that generically we're doing better is because the market segments that we're strategically committed to, market segments where we've added resource at the expense of other market segments where we retracted resource, I think those tend to be markets that are doing extremely well right now, and that's one of the reasons that our performance is differentiated right now. I think secondarily, we've created a great model with our operations and logistics people where we are able to respond very rapidly to upside and downside demand and take care of our customers, and that helps us a little in these -- in the short term, we get a few more orders and we get to pull a few more sale, but I think long term, we've created an environment where customers really believe they can rely on us. And I think that's a big competitive advantage in the longer term. So I think it's those reasons that, really, as we've analyzed everything, are contributing to some of the upside. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank Okay. And just a follow-up on the industrial market. You indicated that you expect to see a continuing demand momentum going forward. But if we look at the macro data that is coming out, that seems to indicate some slowdown on the industrial market. So just wondering, how do you reconcile the 2 data points? And also within the data... Jerald Fishman Well, you have to have a point of view in trying to manage this business, and we tend to listen a lot more to what our customers are saying than to what economic sagers are saying right now. So we've always had a philosophy over the last couple of years that we're going to build what our customers say they need, and we're going to keep the lead time short and we're going to deliver to them when they need the product. And if it turns out that the customers are wrong, then we'll have a little bit too much inventory, which generally is not a problem for us because a lot of it lasts forever given the product cycles that we have. But the one thing that we can't afford to do and that we won't do is try to second-guess our customers of what they're telling us over the next few quarters. So we're going to build what the customers say they want, and we're going to be prepared to respond to upside if it's a little bit better. And we're going to be able to throttle pretty quickly if it looks like they're not meeting their forecast. That's all we can do in running the company. Because if you read all of the summaries and you try to track all the economic analysis, I mean, it just gets very confusing. And I think you make very large mistakes by doing that. So we have a very simple model. The customers tell us they want it, we build it. Operator And we have a question from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. The first question is just, you breakout on one of your categories, it's amplifiers and RF. On the RF side, I was hoping you could talk about where you see you guys now, product wise, and what that roadmap might look like for your products in that category over the next couple of years. Robert McAdam Well, the RF -- our RF business actually has various aspects, and the largest portion of it is in communications infrastructure. As we've said over the years, we are at a very strong position, data converters in the communications industry except for the base stations are the main parts. And over the last 7 years, we've been investing in components in the RF and we've been billing our share aggressively over that. The second part of the RF business is in the industrial space, a lot of smart metering, a lot of industrial and communications and remote sensing, and our narrowband RF pallets are selling in those bases. So we just see RF in the final frontier in terms of performance frequency and we have said the business has been growing very steadily versus the last one. But we haven't -- we have and we'll continue to increase our share in the base station area as increased considering -- that's actually one of the driving factors over the last year and a half. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. Okay. And I just had one quick follow-up on gross margin. I apologize if you touched on it but in the past, you'd indicated a couple of drivers for margin were going to be pricing the products a little bit better. And then the other thing was you had certain products you thought you could design for manufacturability in a better way. I apologize if you've touched on that but if you haven't, could you just give us an update how far are you in terms of those 2 issues, or is there still room left to get some more margin gain out of that? Jerald Fishman Well, certainly, those are all factors that led to -- if you look over the last year or 2, gross margins are up 12 points or something, 13 points. So those are all factors that are contributing to that. So I'd say that that's a never-ending mission at Analog. We're continuing to bang on the products where the margins are and what we want them to be. We're continuing to look for opportunities to keep the price levels up and -- particularly for the older products, where customers really value the fact that we'll supply them for 20 years. So I think a lot of those things are areas that we just continuously focus on. And before it's successful, that ought to help, and -- but it doesn't end. It hasn't ended with where we are today. But no, we're not going to predict the future on that until we get, so -- but overall, that's a continuing program at ADI is the best I can say. Operator And then we have a question from the line of Shawn Webster from Macquarie. Deepon Sen Gupta  This is Deepon for Shawn. I had a question about your Communications business. It looks like it's reaccelerated during the quarter despite the weak China spend. Can you talk about the dynamics of that market? Is there some kind of dollar content story that's taking off here at LTE? Or what else do you think is going on here? Vincent Roche Yes, we have -- our business is strong across the 3G, and now we're seeing an emergence of 4G technologies being deployed in areas like America, for example. So typically, 3, 5 years ago, our business was heavily 2G, a 2.5G base. The content we're getting per system in the 3G and 4G systems is higher with each progression from across the generations. We're getting typically higher value content per system, and I expect that to continue in the future as well. So that's a big, big part of it. So I think part of the story is that there's just more deployments across the board in general as operators scramble to meet the capacity needs to be able to meet the consumers' need for mobile, video, data payload increases. So I think in general what we're seeing is a mixture of macro trends and ADI getting more share per customer and more content per system. And I expect that to continue in the years ahead. Jerald Fishman I think one of the takeaways that I commented on in the opening comments was that our business grew pretty significantly despite that TD-SCDMA has been sort of much lower over the last 6 to 9 months. And that just goes to the breadth of the deployments that are going on in our position with customers who are supplying to a much wider market than just China. So I think we look at that as a good leading indicator for the future because eventually the TD-SCDMA deployments will pick up and we'll get that on top of what we're already getting in the broader market. So with the large infrastructure customers, the top 5 or 6, ones that had up to 90% of the market, we have extremely strong position, and that's really helping us. There were a lot of -- there used to be a lot of comments and fears that most of the business was China, and that if TD-SCDMA slow down, that business will disappear. I think the fact that we're doing this well without any real growth there is very concerning for us. Deepon Sen Gupta  That's very helpful. Also, public sector. There's been some commentary, especially Cisco this week about a weakening public sector. People's -- obviously, Washington has had a lot of issues with budgets. Are you seeing any weakness in the defense sector or any kind of other public business that you have? Robert McAdam No, I think we've seen a little growth. We loop aerospace and defense into the same cluster. And we are seeing, I would say, very, very moderate growth there. But I don't see any particularly discernible trends on the public sector effect on our business. Deepon Sen Gupta  But you don't see any weakness going forward or anything to cause concern? Robert McAdam That's a relatively small portion of the business. Jerald Fishman Yes. I mean, that's a small part of that industrial category. We thought from time to time we ought to grow that more, because our products are very suitable in many of those applications. But we just haven't had a huge focus on that. Maybe that's some opportunity for the future, but it's not a very large portion of our sales today. Operator And we have a question from the line of Sumit Dhanda from Citadel Securities. Ian Eigenbrod This is Ian in for Sumit. Just a question. Could you comment a little bit on orders quarter-to-date and how that may relate to the level you saw in February, sort of pre-earthquake spike? David Zinsner I think what I can tell you is the oil level that we had for the first couple of weeks was pretty indicative of what our guidance is. Ian Eigenbrod Okay. So maybe just to ask differently, if you kept the current rate, would you expect a positive book-to-bill in the quarter? Jerald Fishman We really just don't know. So I mean, we -- the quarter is only 2 weeks old. We tried to take a look at it and see if our universe changed in the 2 weeks since we ended the quarter. I think what Dave said, it hasn't, and I think that's all we could really say or try to project based on 2 weeks of data. Ian Eigenbrod Okay. Good. Fair enough. And then just on automotive, Jerry, I think you touched on this a little bit. Could you pause that Automotive business between the sort of core traditional safety business and maybe some of these newer infotainment and powertrain applications? Is it -- are those new apps half the business today or more or? Robert McAdam Maybe on the safety business, it's not airbags anymore. It's a descriptive tool. So we've seen a lot of growth in the actual lens-based part of our business, which is really around stability control, anti-skid systems using our gyroscopes. And the remaining growth is coming from, as we mentioned earlier, battery monitoring, engine sensing and just all of the additional segment processing that goes around making cars more efficient whether they're -- and those are many casting cars to date, and that's where most of it is coming from. But the traditional core, as you call it, lens business has transformed from being an airbag business to being a stability control business, and that's where we kind of get... Jerald Fishman As well. Vincent Roche As well as that's we're getting the growth. Jerald Fishman Yes. We've mentioned in the past the gyroscope products that were an enormous invention. And in fact, just last quarter, we promoted the guy who sort of invented a lot that in Analog, the fellow in Analog, which is our higher technical chief. And it's really gotten a lot of traction. I mean, our gyro is unique in the industry. It offers tremendous advantage. And stability control is a huge opportunity going forward, because it's legislated in many countries now. And so I think that's one of the areas that we're getting a lot of upside in, and I think we will continue. But I don't have the breakout of how much that business is versus the engine control. I mean, down in the ranks we probably do, but I don't have it handy here. Operator And there are no more questions at this time. Mindy Kohl Okay. That concludes our Q&amp;A session. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again for the third quarter 2011 call on August 16. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is August 16, 2011. With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI CEO, Jerry Fishman Jerald Fishman Well, good afternoon. As you know, from this afternoon's press release, ADI's revenues for the third quarter were approximately $758 million, which was up 5% from the same quarter last year but down 4% sequentially from Q2. As you may recall, we were somewhat cautious about our Q3 revenues, given our well-above seasonal 9 to 10 revenue increase sequentially in Q2, which we believe was in part, the results of inventory builds in the supply chain due to Japan earthquake-related supply chain disruptions and the fear of industry-wide supply reductions.  It now appears as if customers built more inventory than we anticipated last quarter, and they liquidated it more rapidly than we had planned for. Notwithstanding these perturbations in supply, most of the end markets we serve remain relatively stable in Q3, particularly the communications market, the automotive market and also the industrial markets.  Our Consumer business recovered slightly in Q3, but less than we have planned at the beginning of the quarter. Our revenues in Q3 were impacted by 2 distinct drivers, both of which we believe had more to do with supply-chain issues than end demand. First, a portion of the revenue shortfall was a result of a few communications infrastructure customers, delaying orders to ADI in response to component shortages from other vendors, as well as the liquidation of excess safety stocks that they built in Q2. Our shipments to these customers returned to more normal levels in July.  While there were many other puts and takes at our other large customers, for the most part, revenue at those customers was in line with our forecast. The balance of the shortfall was from the 50,000 small and midsized customers, served through our distribution channel. Our distributors report that their customers have been burning off excess inventory, particularly from suppliers like ADI, who had consistently short lead times and kept up with the increased order rates that we experienced in the second quarter.  Recent conversations with our 2 largest distributors indicate that inventory reductions are proceeding in an orderly fashion with few cancellations and few backlog adjustments. I think it's instructive to look at the end market trends in both Q2 and Q3 to better understand these trends and most importantly, the implications of those trends going forward.  Industrial revenues declined 5% sequentially in Q3 after growing 14% sequentially in Q2. This looks to us like an inventory build in Q2 that was reversed in Q3. On a year-over-year basis, industrial sales for the quarter grew 8%, which is consistent with our expectations for the industrial business over the long term.  While our largest industrial customers in the United States and Europe are somewhat more cautious than they were last quarter at this time, for the most part, they're planning for a stable environment for the balance of the year. And our industrial sales in China, are continuing to grow.  Automotive revenue declined 5% sequentially in Q3 after growing 12% sequentially in Q2. Year-over-year, our Automotive sales for the quarter grew 21%. We now have significantly more content in autos than we did last year and our revenue is more dependent on content growth than on unit sales. We're extremely well-positioned in the automotive market.  Our current forecast for our automotive customers are also stable in the near term, and unless the economic outlook changes drastically, this market should remain an area of strength for ADI going forward, as our automotive revenues are now running at a rate in excess of $400 million annually.  Communications revenues declined 7% sequentially, after growing about 7% in Q2. On a year-over-year comparative basis, Communications revenues grew 10% in Q3. It seems very clear to us that our Q3 revenue was significantly impacted by both Chinese and European customer order push outs, which resulted from the shortage of other vendors' components and also the associated inventory and balances that existed in those accounts. While there are still concerns about short-term demand in United States and Europe in this sector, the Asian markets report that demand remains strong and are optimistic about the balance of the year.  Consumer revenue was up 4% sequentially after declining 7% sequentially in Q2, and was up less than we planned in Q3 and down 14% year-over-year. This year-over-year decline is primarily the results of our intensifying focus on only higher value-added consumer applications, where a technology is highly differentiated and our position is sustainable over many generations. Nevertheless, we have seen some improvement in our short-term backlog for consumer products, which is seasonally very typical at this point for the year and we're hopeful that this business will stabilize further during our fourth quarter.  On a geographic basis, revenues increased sequentially in Japan and also in China but decreased sequentially in the rest of Asia, in Europe and in North America. While our Q3 revenues were below the plan we had for the quarter, we did react quickly to protect the downside. As a result, even on a lower revenue base, our gross margins remained about 67%, operating expenses declined 2% sequentially, essentially flat for the same quarter last year, and our operating margin was just under 37% of revenues.  Inventories grew only slightly and operating cash flow totaled $257 million or 34% of revenues during the quarter. Including $0.01 that resulted from a tax catch up, earnings were $0.71, which were in line with the guidance range we communicated last quarter. Dave in a few minutes, we'll discuss more details of these financial results.  As far as the order rates in Q3, clearly, orders weakened for us in May and continued at these lower levels throughout the quarter and also into early August. And not surprisingly as coincident in time with our significant reduction in the fears that were industry wide about chronic supply shortages. Nevertheless, our order rates have stabilized at these levels. And as of now, it show no signs of further deterioration.    Our OEM backlog, which includes forecast orders from our largest customers, declined only slightly during the quarter, while our backlog from distribution declined more than that as a result of our distributor's stated commitment to reduce their inventories, particularly for suppliers like ADI, who provide very, very short lead times.  During the inflection points like Q3 when supply is very strong, orders have proven over many, many years, not to be a very reliable indicator of future sales, since turned orders tend to comprise a much larger percentage of quarterly sales. We believe that the consumption of our products in Q3 was above our recorded orders as a result of inventory reductions at many customers. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave to talk a little more detail about the financial results and I'll make some closing remarks after Dave is done. David Zinsner As Jerry discussed, third quarter revenue was $758 million, a decline of 4% sequentially, but an increase of 5% from the same period last year. Our gross margin remains strong despite the sequential revenue decline coming in at 67.2%, down 40 basis points from the prior quarter, and within the range we indicated on last quarter's call. The decline was due to decreased loadings in our factories versus last quarter.  Operating expenses for the third quarter were $231 million, down $5 million or 2%. In the third quarter, we benefited from our lower and more variable operating expense structure, in particular, from lower variable compensation payments versus the second quarter. Toward the end of the quarter, we implemented cost control measures, which also helped reduce expenses. We plan to continue these programs in the fourth quarter to protect our profits.  Operating profits for the third quarter were $279 million or 36.8% of sales compared to 37.8% of sales in the prior quarter. Obviously, operating profits were down both in dollars and percentage terms as a result of the lower revenue in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Other expense was $4 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior quarter, the increase was the result of incurring a full quarter of interest expense associated with the $375 million bond offering we completed in the second quarter.  Our third quarter tax rate was 20%, down from 22.1% in the second quarter, as we revised the annual rate to 21.3%. We expect the tax rate in the fourth quarter to be 21.3% as well. Diluted earnings per share was $0.71, within the range of guidance we provided last quarter. This compares to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75 in the prior quarter. As I just mentioned, we revised our year-to-date tax rate to 21.3% for the year, which lowered our third quarter tax rate to 20%. This catch up provided $0.01 benefit to our EPS.  In addition to solid profitability, we maintained strong cash flow performance, generating 34% of our revenue or $257 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $37 million, resulting in free cash flow of $220 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter.  During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares or $66 million of ADI stock and distributed $75 million in dividends to our shareholders. At current stock prices, at least as of the close today, our dividend yield is now around 3.2%.  Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid to shareholders of record as of September 14th -- sorry, as of August 26, 2011, and we pay it on September 14, 2011.  We closed the third quarter with $3.5 billion in cash, of which $1.2 billion or 33% is in the U.S. Net cash, excluding approximately $900 million in debts was $2.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. Our accounts receivable balance decreased sequentially by 10% due to lower sales, and our days sales outstanding decreased 3 days from the prior quarter to 45 days. Inventory at the end of the third quarter increased by 2% sequentially and our days of inventory were 110 days compared to 104 days in the prior quarter.  Although we were planning for higher sales, we were able to react and slow the inventory build towards the end of the quarter. Our distributor inventory increased a few days and is now slightly above target levels. As a result, we expect distributors to reduce their inventory levels in the fourth quarter. It's important to note that the reduction in distributor inventory will not impact revenue since revenue recognition does not -- or since revenue does not get recognized until after the distributor ships our product to the end customer. However, we are cognizant of these inventory adjustments at distributors and is factored into our plans for this quarter.  In summary, despite lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter, we delivered strong profitability and cash flow and we expect this to continue. Over the course of the last 2 years, we have fundamentally lowered our cost of manufacturing, which has driven record levels of gross margins over the last several quarters. We believe that the lower cost per unit will also benefit us in the periods which can make rev demand weaker, by keeping gross margins considerably higher in previous troughs. We have also created a lower and more variable cost structure for operating expenses, one that is highly responsive to both upside opportunity, as well as the need for downside protection.  We believe our model, coupled with vigilant operating expense control, positions us well to respond to whatever market fluctuations may occur in the fourth quarter. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, who will discuss the short and long-term outlook Jerald Fishman Well, obviously, planning revenues in the short term is very challenging. On one hand, we believe that most of the decline in Q3 was the result of supply inventory imbalances and therefore, could be short lived. If we had recorded a more normal seasonal Q2, our Q3 revenue would have been at or above Q2 levels. That scenario would imply that Q4 could be a normal seasonal quarter for ADI, or approximately flat to down slightly compared to Q3.  Our internal forecast indicate some sequential growth in Communications infrastructure and Automotive revenues, offsetting the slight decline in the Industrial revenues, with Consumer growing seasonally.  But nevertheless, this increasing uncertainty in many parts of the global economy is very possible that all this chaos will cause a decline in demand as customers become more cautious and push out new programs and consumers reduce spending on discretionary items.  If that occurs, we could see a decline in all of our end markets and our revenues could decrease sequentially. We really have no way to predict which way this will go. So as such we're planning for revenues to be in the range of $715 million to $755 million, or flat to down approximately 6% sequentially.  I think when history is written, we believe that our Q3 will be mostly about supply issues and our Q4 will be mostly determined by end demand. We all have to recognize that there's a wide range of possibilities of what demand might be in Q4, given all the economic uncertainties that we are reminded of, every single day.  So currently, we are planning to reduce production levels in Q4 to bring our inventory levels and distributors and on our balance sheet, down to more appropriate levels. Therefore, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 65% to 66% of sales, depending on the revenue levels that we achieve.  We also plan to carefully manage operating expenses and expect operating expenses to be flat to down 3% sequentially, also depending on the sales we achieve. So with these levels, we expect diluted earnings for the quarter to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.68.  Our best course of action right now is to be very cautious in the short term and work on the things that we can do to control and work on to limit the downside, while remaining very flexible to capture any upside that comes on our way. We've reduced discretionary spending and we're planning to reduce production levels to keep inventory approximately flat to Q3, assuming that we're somewhere at the midpoints of our guidance.  We believe we can respond rapidly if the demand pattern improves and we intend to keep our lead times very short as we have in the last few years. We have a very natural hedge in our operating expenses as our variable compensation plans react quickly to reduce revenue growth. We're also working to ensure that we're allocating critical, strategic resources to the most important programs and away from the less-strategically relevant programs that we've invested.  We're confident in our ability to manage through this period and return to solid growth at extraordinary margins and cash flow as the world becomes more stable. While our quarterly results year-to-date have certainly been whipsawed, by supply gyrations, it's important to put our 2011 fiscal year in better focus.  If we achieved the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, our revenues will have increased by approximately 9% over last year to over $3 billion in 2011 for the first time in our history. Our gross margins will have increased by approximately 150 basis points. Our operating expense growth will be well below our revenue growth and our operating margins will have improved for the year to approximately 36%. Operating cash flow will likely approximate $900 million, and at today's price, our free cash flow yield is approximately 8%. These results are in line with what we plan to achieve in fiscal 2011, and we believe that we're executing well against our plan.  While we can't predict the near-term future any better than anyone else, we do believe that if we're given at least a neutral economic environment, ADI could continue to grow with credible rates between 8% and 12% a year, keep improving our operating performance and keep generating a very significant amount of cash. Mindy Kohl Thank you, Jerry. We're now turning into Q&amp;A period, please limit yourselves to one primary question and no more than one follow-up question. We'll give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Uche Orji with UBS. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Let me just start by asking you, there's been so much parallel drawn about this current environment with 2008, and some companies are commenting that we've already been seeing early signs of double-dip recession. The question for you is, how similar do you see this environment in 2008? And also, what is the level of ADI preparation just in case the environment deteriorates much further than your companies are guiding at the moment? I mean how much prepared are you now, relative to '08? That's my first question. Jerald Fishman Well, of course, we don't know any more than everybody knows about what the future and to talk about what's going to happen economically around the globe is the subject, and continuously, about great conjecture about what's going to happen. But at least that's the way we see it. There are a couple of factors that tend to convince us that this is not a repeat of 2008, 2009 in the demand patterns we're seeing. The first thing is in 2008 and 2009, we saw very significant weakness in a few market segments and this time, when we look at all the product segments and all the market segments that we serve, we saw them all go down at about the same rate, which to us seems to indicate it's more -- at least for us in Q3, it's more about supply than demand. The other fact that our distributors point out to us in our recent conversation is that they haven't seen a lot of significant cancellations or backlog adjustments, which indicates to them mostly what we're seeing is an orderly reduction of inventory rather than the severe dislocations that we all experienced in 2008 and 2009. So at Analog, unlike many other companies in the industry, we had a very significant run up in Q2, well above our seasonal rates. When we grow 9% sequentially in the quarter, that typically, we'd grow 4% to 5%. That sort of rates that there was an inventory built in the channel and most of what we saw last quarter from both the distributors statistics and also the commentaries from our largest customers, the great thing to believe, it's much more about -- at least in Q3, much more about supply than demand. It's also interesting in Analog what Dave mentioned when we reported our distribution sales, which were half of our sales were sellout. So last quarter, the distributor's built quite a bit of inventory, which shows up as revenues for many companies, but not revenues for Analog Devices.  So while we would all that up, and we listened to the comments from the large customers, the comments from our distributors, at least in Q3, I believe we will come to believe that it was mostly about supply gyrations, not demand. I think as far as what happens in the future, we really don't know. You could read this report or that, you can read a summary or that, I mean this editorial of New York Times or another one of The Wall Street Journal, and there's a bunch of opinions out there of what's going to happen. And we can't predict that, which is why the range of possibilities for Q4, at least as we see it, is very large.  In the short term, as, I think, Dave indicated and I made some comments on, we're really being careful on discretionary expenses. We have a natural hedge on our expense growth with the variable comp plan, which when -- last year's results were coming in, was paying at an extremely high rates and has now cycle down pretty hard, and will continue to as results are getting better. We're reallocating resources to the projects and the segments, and the customers that are the most strategically relevant for us. We have very low and variable manufacturing cost structure. So I think we're in pretty good shape to react to anything the world throws at us, although I would repeat, we really just don't know what the world is going to throw at us next quarter. But I think we have a very resilient business model now, much more resilient than it was 2 or 3 years ago, much more of our costs of variable and our product portfolio is lot less volatile than what it has been. So again, if the world goes to hell, our results won't be that great, but I think we're well-suited to respond to whatever the world throws at us. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Can I just ask a quick follow up. Let me just speak on Automotive. You've seem to have grown regardless of all the dislocations now. Question for you here is, how much more runway do we see for growth in automotive? And if you can talk about segmentation by region, or also by type of car, high end or low end, you have to of course understand, what's driving that growth and how much further there is to go? Jerald Fishman Well, historically, I'll ask Vince to comment on this in a few minutes to get his point of view. But historically, most of our growth in the automotive market has been in the higher-end cars, which are much more feature rich and have much more safety and cockpit measurement going on. So historically, we've done the best with European manufacturers, and some of the high end America manufacturers. More recently, we've done well with some of the Asian manufacturers as well. So I think at the end of the day, that business has been growing very robustly for us. We have very strong position in that business. Just last week when we were talking to the guy that runs our Automotive business for us, he tends to be very well-connected, to the build rates that our customers are forecasting. And everyone is nervous, but he's sort of indicating to us that he understands the build rates and they're commensurate with the kind of numbers and direction that we've indicated. So we'll just have to wait and see how that turns out. Vince, do you have anything else? Vincent Roche Yes, I think just a follow on to Jerry's points, we are very well penetrated I think today in the mid to high ends. The diversity of our business is quite good in the Automotive sector. We supply into the safety sector, the monitoring sector, sensing the battery control and infotainment. And Jerry said there's -- in the scripts, there's basically a huge demand. We're just capped by the rate at which our customers can absorb the technology. There's no fundamental limit on the performance requirements that they've got. So as -- it's not a question of unit volumes for ADI. We're very well penetrated, it's a question of just how well car sales move in the mid to high end and we'll be there. We'll do well I believe in the future. Jerald Fishman This definitely is just -- the automotive industry ADI has emerged from, the early days when it's mostly about airbags and safety features. And even though that's still a very important business for us, particularly with our new gyroscopes that we're selling a very high volume right now. There's just so many other applications, essentially that sensing and entertainment applications that really require very, very high end analog technology and DSP technology. And it's those applications that are really driving our growth Operator The next question is from Craig Ellis with Caris and Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Jerry, it was helpful to get the geographic color on Industrial. I'm wondering if you can talk about some of the specific submarkets as well, such as medical, automated tests and others. Are you seeing similar trends in terms of order activity there? Or is there a divergence, given the diversity of end markets? Jerald Fishman Well, it's similar but it's like slightly divergent. The test equipment market certainly is at the margin weaker than it's been in line with all the uncertainty in semiconductor demand out there. I think that's clear. And the medical market was probably a little weaker also to just the hospitals, really worried about capital spending and new medical course constraints in the United States and all the other parts of Obama care. But I think the other markets, the industrial automation market was still pretty strong. Instrumentation market, process control is still pretty strong. So these aren't meaningful differences, Craig, but they are notable differences in some of those end markets. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Okay, that's helpful. And then, Dave, you had mentioned that there are 2 benefits to OpEx. One was just the variable comp program, and then I think you mentioned that there were specific OpEx initiatives that you put in place and are working. Can you go into a bit more detail on what those are, and how much benefit are you getting in the flat to down 3% guidance in the out quarter for us? David Zinsner Well obviously, it wasn't until towards the end of the quarter that we started to recognize that we might need to put some things in place. So we really probably didn't get too much benefit in the third quarter. Although it was generally around restricting, hiring and starting to eliminate some of the more discretionary oriented parts of the P&amp;L. And that's expected to continue this quarter to make sure we maintain the appropriate level of profitability. Jerald Fishman I think, Craig, the other thing that goes on is, when things get a little uncertain or soft, we tend to raise the bar on strategic investment and where we put the money and how patient we are in some areas that we can carry in. So I think of the margin as we go into 2012, that's going to continue. That's not a -- necessarily a reaction to softer order rates, but more a reaction to -- we have just such an enormous opportunity in some segments that we want to make sure that irrespective of what happens in the environment, we can continue to fund those things. And that sometimes takes much greater selectivity and there's more uncertainty out there. But I think the most important thing is the basic rudiments of our cost structure, it's just much more variable than they were a couple years ago, and that really hasn't hurt us much on the upside when business is great, paying large variable comp payments there, every employee in the company really helps us. But on the other hand, it really helps us on the downside when we can keep a lot of the strategic programs going and still get the benefits of being very responsive to the softness that this -- for a period of time in the order rate. So if the world really is catastrophic, we'll have to think about it differently. But right now, we think that's -- we can keep the expenses moving in the same direction as the revenues. Operator The next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG Jerry, you talked about the cost structure variability before. I think a year ago, you mentioned that about 17% of your OpEx was variable. How was that in comparison today? Jerald Fishman Yes, so obviously, it came down this quarter in reaction to the lower revenue. So it's about 12% of our revenue is now variable. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG So as you go forward, that percentage you think will adjust, so you become increasingly variable or the fact that the revenues are falling as fast as they are and your costs are fixed, you're going to make that percentage actually stay where it is? David Zinsner If we're in an environment where OpEx needs to come down, that probably becomes less variable as the variable aspect of the operating expense starts to decline. But revenues start to go the other direction, then it will expand with revenues and increase as a percent of... Vincent Roche I think the way to think about some variable comp plan is that, I believe we indicated a few quarters ago that there's a very simple formula that there were 2 elements of. One is the operating margins. The other one is sales growth. So the fact that we're still earning very significant operating margins, means there's still significant variable comp payment at the company, even thought the growth rate has tailed off in the quarter. So I think, you start getting into where the world starts coming on glued, I think we still got plenty of room on the variable side for those payments to go down. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG I guess as my follow up, Jerry, you talked a lot about the supply disruptions being a bigger issue than the demand side. If demand were to stabilize from here, how long do you think it would take before the supply side of the equation was brought back into line? Jerald Fishman Well, there are varying opinions of that. We just talked recently to our distributors about that, that have these very broad product portfolios and many customers and many suppliers. And there are some difference of opinion on that, amongst the distributors. There are -- on one end, some of them believe that it's mostly behind us and might have another couple of months to run. The other more pessimistic view is if I got 2 quarters to run. But nobody really knows for sure because the customers don't know for sure. So I'd say somewhere between a couple of months, probably at the outside, maybe one quarter or 2 quarters. [indiscernible] you synthesize all the comments from all of the distinct groups that we talked. One other qualifier would be, I think the most serious parts of that we've experienced. We saw a pretty rapid inventory reductions going on, almost coincident to the week that the commentary about supplies being available started coming out and all the panic came out of it. So I think the most significant reductions is the supply chain has sort of probably occurred and the rest of it for the next maybe a few months or worst case, another quarter or 2, are probably much less significant than the ones we've seen. Operator And the next question is from Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co This is Venk Nathamuni, in for Chris. A couple of questions. One, Jerry, you talked about inventory level of distribution, the plans for your -- for ADI to reduce that inventory level. But could you help quantify what the historical level of inventory is on average of distribution is, and where it is now and where do you expect it to be next quarter? David Zinsner This is Dave Zinsner, actually. So inventory, we measure it more or less by number of weeks. And inventory usually runs around 8 weeks. It's a little bit higher than that today by a couple of days. Our expectation is it will come down by a few days next quarter. Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co Okay, great. Thanks. And then given the significant sell-off in the stock, and the fact that you have considerable buyback authorization, what are your plans for continued buybacks and the quantum of buyback? David Zinsner Well, we have $1 billion buyback program that was authorized in December of last year. We've already purchased $200 million worth of ADI stock under that plan so we have $800 million left. I think you'll see as we have in the past, been committed to returning cash to shareholders both in the form of dividends that increase over time and buybacks. And you'll see examples of that commitment going forward. Jerald Fishman I think, I believe is pretty attractive. These questions were a bit -- it kind of yields and the expectations for the future, even though there's a lot of gyration going on and everyone is real nervous about the short term. Operator And the next question is from Terence Whalen with Citi. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc This one circles back against the industrial end market and some of the commentary you made there. I believe you said in some of your comments that the Chinese region within Industrial grew. I was wondering if you can give us more color around that and what gives you confidence that, that's not a continued stocking with the real demand. And also in your expectation, I think you mentioned in your baseline scenario, industrial would decline. Do you expect them to decline in a similar pace, down 5% sequentially or slighter than that or more heavily than that? Jerald Fishman Well, we don't know for sure because we never know about whether it's stockpiling in China or not. But there's not a lot of concerns right now about supply. So where there were a lot of concerns about supply, there was much more likelihood and opportunity to stockpile inventory. Although you'll only find out about the idea after the fact, so we really don't know for sure. I think the industrial environment in China is very robust. There's a huge amount of industrialization going on that continues in China, that's been growing at a pretty good rate for a while. And even in 2008 and 2009 when the world fell apart, our Industrial business in China kept growing. So I mean again, it's always difficult to predict the future but there's a lot of good signs on that business in China. What was the second question, I forgot? David Zinsner If you expect industrial to decline. Jerald Fishman I'd say our forecast right now, at least for the people that are running the Industrial business, we're expecting that to decline slightly, which is very typical in the fourth quarter because Europe slows down and Europe is a very large source of our Industrial business. But we don't expect, at least in the forecast, we now have, any significant decline, probably on lower decline than we have this quarter, in third -- in fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc Okay, that's very helpful and then the quick follow up would be, you mentioned about lower factory loading. Could you remind us where utilization was maybe this quarter and what you might expect it to be next quarter? I believe last quarter you had said around 80%. David Zinsner Yes, so second quarter utilization was 80%. This quarter, it was -- third quarter, that was, it was 77%. We were expecting it to be kind of in the low 70s for the fourth quarter. And that's built into our gross margin assumption. Operator And the next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. I know you guys don't like to forecast 1 quarter ahead. But just curious if you could walk us through the logic a little bit about how we would think about the January quarter? Since you seem to have some unusual seasonal patterns here, typically, if the January quarter will be down a little bit, but since you had the 2 sort of sequential drops here for July and October, is it possible that, that could be more flattish to up, or would you still think that might be potentially down? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean we -- I'd have to say we really have no idea. My own personal opinion is that, we'll see more effects in the next couple of quarters that are based on what's going on in the economy and overall demand patterns than we will seasonal patterns that are considered to be normal. We look back and we always look back at the last couple of years, what's the seasonal pattern for the quarter. And I can report to you that our analysis indicated that we can't figure out what the seasonal patterns are. The only -- because there's so many different factors that go into each year, it seems lately, that those sort of more exogenous factors have more to do with -- than the typical seasonal factors. Less of our business is consumer than it used to be, so that might change the seasonal factors. More of our business is industrial and infrastructure, that might change the seasonal factors. So I just don't know enough that we'd look for sort of what the backlogs are, what customers are saying that we do, that we rely on long term going back 3, 4 years and trying to predict 1 quarter's growth relative to another. It's just too many other factors. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. And you mentioned a little bit about -- it looks like telecom might be up a little bit. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what's driving that in that sort of -- more of a something that happens, continuous to evolve over the next couple of quarters or that's just from some lumpiness? Any color would be helpful. Vincent Roche Well, I think in the third quarter, demand was generally strong across digital. And I think our sales were certainly crimped by the lack of supply to our largest customers. As a result of the tsunami in Japan, but what we're being told by our largest customers is that they're optimistic about the second half of the calendar year, and we are expecting to have good results in the fourth quarter and hopefully, in the first quarter as well. But I think overall, there's a very strong build out in China, particularly in the replacement of the GSM cycle, TD-SCDMA and particularly, in the developed world, the build out of LTE 4G is moving at a fair pace. Jerald Fishman Yes, I think the only way we can report is what the customers tell us. We have a very significant share in that business, particularly in the analog part of the buildup materials. And we have that share as the largest market shareholders, in the wireless business. So I think what Vincent said is what they're telling us. And that's why we believe that in the absence of real economic uncertainty accelerating, I mean that's what those customers believe. So we'll stop doing and see how that turns out. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. If I could just slip a follow-up on that. Specific thoughts on the optical market, the build out of -- say, 40 to 100 gigabit per second infrastructure the slightly different infrastructure than anything else? Vincent Roche Well as you probably know, most of the -- in the optical build out is in the energy sector, the edge for 10G. So I think in terms of 40 gig, 100 gig, there are certainly technologies for the future but most of the action that we see is the 10 gig, and also to some extent, 2.5 gig. Jerald Fishman Mostly a bargain today. Vincent Roche Yes, certainly in terms of the volumes. But there's certainly a deployment of 40 gig, 100 gig in the core, but we're expecting -- in terms of volumes, we certainly expect 10 gig to be dominant. Operator And the next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Dave, I heard what you said earlier about inventory being down a couple days. Was that specific to your balance sheet or the distis or some combination of both? David Zinsner I would call it some combination of both. Basically, we're looking at inventory ballistically. But inventory on our balance sheet, the inventory at distribution. We know in aggregate they're going to be down, difficult to determine how much distributors will drop their inventory versus what we'll do with our inventory. But in aggregate, we expect inventory to be down. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I guess this question is a little tricky to ask clearly, so I hope I can pull this off. But if I look at how much inventory grew on the distributors' balance sheets this quarter, and then their guidance for their component sales to be down in the upcoming September quarter, do their orders on you -- are there orders on you consistent with that, if that's clear? Jerald Fishman Well, the orders on us have been weak during the third quarter. I don't think there's any doubt about that. Our conversations with the distributors, I mean they seem to indicate they want to get their inventories down. They haven't issued any massive directives at their product people to desecrate the inventories. But I think having said that, we've seen the orders from the distributors on Analog go down at a faster pace than the orders of our customers and our distributors, and that's indicative of the distributors going to reduce inventory. And that's -- we've been pretty cycled for -- I'm sorry to admit it, that part of 20 years, and that's what you typically see during these periods, where the distributors wake up and they say, \"Oh my god, I've got too much inventory,\" they start flushing it. And the customers, a little -- a lot less so than the distributor. Now why would you look at all these book-to-bill ratios, all these things that practically, every folks are trying to predict the future. In these kind of times, they're totally useless. Because unless you understand what's going on in the inventory, all that other stuff doesn't mean anything. And those numbers can change quickly on the other side as they do on the downside. So that's the best we can do on that, Jim. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I appreciate that. If I could ask just one other one. How do you think about -- I heard what you said about utilization, Dave? How do you think about breaking that up between your internal wafer starts today? Are you going to favor internal wafer starts over outsourcing in order to keep utilization a little bit higher? How does that break down? David Zinsner We weren't really managing utilization to manage the inventory levels. To make them at an appropriate level to keep our lead time short but not build inventory that we're not going to need, we're going to have to throw away. Jerald Fishman A lot of the product we have, there's a small amount of products that are sizable between external foundries and our internal fabs. But mostly, the very fine line, seamless products, we don't build internally. So we don't have much of an ability or interest in sort of taking stuff that we're building, and TSMC and bringing it inside, although we have some abilities to do that. So as Dave said, we just manage the internal factories to the internal loads that we see from our customers on those things, and try to keep the inventory reasonably low but still be responsive just to get some upside. Because with all the doom and gloom out there right now, 1 month or 2 months from now, the world could think very differently about it. And the one thing we've learn from last cycle is you keep your lead times short. So we've managed the inventory, to keep the lead time short. Last quarter, a very interesting statistic is we shipped 99% of our revenues with less than the 4-week lead time. And that's what we intend to keep doing. And as the cost of that is a little bit extra inventory, fine, but we're not going to let the inventories run up because we'd like to get the upside when the orders go up. So I mean that's the complicated formula that we follow and that's the way we want the manufacturer reloaded. David Zinsner I think one of the other things that you might be -- part of this question is our gross margins of 65 to 66 are really good relative to where they may have been in other cycles where we've seen a decline in our revenue. And the reason is, we fundamentally have lowered the cost per unit of our product. And so if you look at 2008 even in our peak, we were generating 61% operating margins, we're generating for 400 to 500 basis points higher than that, because our cost per unit is actually fundamentally lower than that. Jerald Fishman A lot of the questions that we've gotten over the last couple of quarters have been -- is the things that we talked about, about the variability of the fixed cost structure and the lower levels of the variable cost structure and manufacturing. Are those real or just anomalies? And I think what we're beginning to see is what we have sort of thought all along that these are not fleeting cost reductions, and changes in expense format. They're lasting and when you can put the kind of results up that we put up this quarter, even though they were lower that we had thought when we had a pretty sudden and relatively unexpected decline in revenues, and we're expecting there's a wider variability on the numbers for next quarter, we're still expecting to earn very significant profits. I think that's the sign that the kind of things we've done are now part of the business model at ADI. Operator Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. One question on the margin guidance. Looks a little lighter than in recent prior quarters when you were at similar levels within your current guidance. So I'd point you to maybe Q2 or Q3 2010 or even Q1 of '11. Just wondering if you can give me some feeling for what's different from Q4 versus those prior quarters? Is it only the utilization levels, is it mix, is it pricing, is there something else? David Zinsner There's really nothing about price. Pricing has actually been improving. Mix maybe playing a factor in that, I'd have to go back and look at it. But I think the major difference is, we were in a cycle where we were building inventory on our balance sheet, or just collectively between the balance sheet of our balance sheet and our distributor's balance sheet. We're in the opposite situation this time, where we're looking to drop the aggregate inventory. And so utilization is down a little bit more than or meaningfully lower than where it had been at that point in time. So that's really the difference. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. That's helpful. And if I can ask a quick follow up. I know you said seasonality obviously is externally difficult. But if I were to just go to the exercise right now and roll out what I would view as typical seasonality on your Q4 guidance in the midpoint, I get for 2012 revenue growth, basically flat versus 2011. Do you think it's possible to get flat revenue growth next year versus this year? What sort of an economic environment would you think would be required potentially to see flat or maybe even -- flat revenue growth versus increase, versus declines for 2012? Jerald Fishman Well, I think we'd have to see a better, or more stable economic environment. I think that it's always very dangerous to try to project future quarters based on 1 or 2 quarters of inventory builds. We were on -- before the world came unglued here, both on the supply side and potentially, on the demand side next quarter, we were on a pretty good revenue build up. So I think for us at least, trying to go through this sequential quarters and come up with a real estimate for next year is very, very difficult right now. I mean we wouldn't have predicted the kind of quarter-to-quarter build ups we saw last year in couple of quarters. So I just don't know enough to make a prediction. But the one thing that I'm pretty confident about is if we get a fair shake in the market, we can outgrow the market as we have and we could, it would reach as well, I think you got to get most of our competitors, given the product mix we have with the momentum we have with the large customers. So we're going to have to wait and see. We're in a process right now of trying to put together our 2012 plan. It's certainly not lacking opportunities, our products and technical people have gone through it, and we're just trying to avoid right now, either reacting too strongly or too weekly to very large vicissitudes of changes in demand in the short term, based on factors that are not necessarily long term. So as we get closer, when we look at Q4 and we see where that turn out, we look at the order rates, and we look at the demand pattern, I think as we close out the year, we'll have a much more informed view of what's going to be possible for 2012 . Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. But if it's true that what we're seeing right now is primarily supply driven, and it turns out that the demand scenario was not terribly down, one, it would be reasonable to expect the revenue snap back at some point, once the supply issues are at work, is that correct? Jerald Fishman Yes, I think the major angst that we have about Q4 is, I think I mentioned in the opening remarks, much more about what's going to happen with demand than what could happen on the supply issue. Although, I think the supply issue, will probably still linger a little bit longer. But certainly, at a modulated rate for our last quarter. But mostly, I'm not trying to predict what's going to happen in the macro sense. And in that sense, you're probably smarter about that than we are. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. Is it just the fact that you're getting very limited visibility from your customers that's basically driving the caution around the demand environment in Q4? Jerald Fishman I think -- I keep yelling at Vince, and our sales guy, \"Why can't you be more accurate?\" And their response is the customers don't know what's going to happen. And so I think what happens in companies with all these uncertainty, the wild gyrations go on in the stock market, and all the forecast of economic, who knows what's going to happen. I just think, customers can't predict what's going to happen, and therefore, the purchasing groups try to keep the vendors honest and sort of keep -- they don't tell me what's going to be bad until it's bad. And we try to look at that and judge it. But I think what's really the case is the customers just don't know what's going to happen in the short term with their business. Therefore, it's very hard for us to one-step out of the food chain for that to come up with a very warm opinion of what's going to happen next quarter then we have a lot of confidence, there's too many variables. We, at Analog, we have a very broad product line. We serve so many customers in so many markets in so many geographies in a stable market, so the lower large number is really helpful. But 1 is up, and 1 is down and everything is sort of evens out. And we're generally, pretty close to where our expectations are. But right now, it's just -- there's too many things moving in too many directions to be precise about. I wish I could be and I'm sure you'd like us to be, but when we look at ourselves in the mirror, we just don't know. Operator And the next question is from Parker Paulin with Wells Fargo. Parker Paulin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC A couple of questions, you kind of hit on shades of them, but I was curious as to your operating margins long term this quarter, and the last couple quarters, you've been up in the 35-plus percent range. And it looks like next quarter, you're kind of guiding a little bit below that. Do you think there's a range that's sustainable for you? Jerald Fishman Yes, I mean our sense, nothing that happened this quarter? We changed that view. We think with the mix of business we have, with the continuing pressure on the cost structure of the company, with continuing pricing power that we continue to enjoy in the market, we think that these kind of margins are quite stable going forward. And we think when the revenues are moving in the right direction, they can move above these lines. Parker Paulin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC And second one, you've kind of hit on the sort of future outlook and a little higher overview, but I was just curious if we might be able to get any additional color in terms of the industrial breakout this quarter? Jerald Fishman Well, I think only what I said that the strength in the Industrial business was more of a factory automation, instrumentation side. The weakness seem to be more in the test equipment side, and we consider medical as part of the Industrial part of the business. But as I said earlier, it's not -- these aren't large differences, but they are minor differences but nevertheless, different. Operator And the next question is from Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research So on the, I assume it was below 1 but was book-to-bill below 1 in the quarter? Jerald Fishman Yes. But as I said earlier, I wouldn't think one thing or the other as a result of that. The inventories are being liquidated. So it's interesting but mostly irrelevant statistics. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research But we like to track those kind of things anyway. Jerald Fishman I know you do, but we try to do but our predictability of using that as an indicator of our next quarter sales as we found out this quarter, when book-to-bill was well above 1 last quarter, at least for us, it's not very enlightening. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research Understood. And there's just a couple of smaller ones. Have you noticed any overall change in your mix in the last month or in the last few weeks where people are trying or buying the lower end SKUs? And then the other question was on the consumer area that was less than expected, what application area was that? Jerald Fishman Well, we're not seeing any real differences. I mean customers buy what they're selling. And the product they have was selling, we said not that we have very many low-end products, but generally, I don't think there's anything that is noteworthy about the kind of products that people are buying. Our average selling prices, which were represented into the mix were relatively constant. So I don't think there's any -- anything really noteworthy on that. The second question, specific to consumer was it, Shawn? Yes, I think it's -- there's a broad range of consumer products that in second quarter, went down a lot of the -- we covered a little bit for Q3. The backlogs went up a little bit, so maybe we'll recover a little bit more in Q4 in line with normal seasonality, back-to-school, all that kind of stuff. But walk away and see how that happens, there wasn't any one particular application. Operator And the next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. Dave, accounting question for you. Utilization is coming down this quarter. I think you said into the low 70% range. Did that fully get reflected in gross margins? Or is it still in October because you have to sell the inventory? David Zinsner Usually when the variance kind of go negative, that in generally it just goes right through the P&amp;L. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. So is it fair to say that if October is the bottom for revenues, that it's also probably the bottom for gross margin? David Zinsner Yes. Obviously, it depends on what the aggregate inventory levels are going to do in the following quarter. But if the following quarter, they stabilize or moving up because revenues increasing, then I think you could say that, that's the trough. Operator And the next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc. I'm just wondering, when you look at your inventory levels in-house, any 2 of your sheet that you need to -- working down a little bit? I know there's a couple of questions already on it, but I just wanted to get your thoughts there. David Zinsner So the question is whether the inventory levels on our balance sheet need to come down, is that what the question is? Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc. Yes. David Zinsner Yes, I think we always take a look at this in aggregate. We certainly had 110 days of inventory or at the kind of high end of our range. So we are over time, probably looking to bring those down more closer to 100 days. But we're just -- as a process in near term, you look at the aggregate inventory between what we have on our balance sheet, what the distributors have on their balance sheet, and we look to try to in aggregate, bring those down. Jerald Fishman I think it's also true that, we in the past, have carried much larger inventory than that. And we rarely have write-downs for those inventories. Because particularly, the internal products we built have such long life cycle. And the reason I was trying to keep the inventories lower than the peak levels that we've had in the past, just for the reason of the first \"question\" that just got asked, we have found that it's much better for us to have a much more rapid snapback in the gross margins than try to preserve another point or so of gross margins by keeping the factories overloaded. And we really run the company around the lead times. So we're going to make sure that the lead times stay low and that's going to absorb the inventory rather than the other way around. Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc. Okay and on the industrial, sir, I know you mentioned, things are still looking pretty stable. What's your book-to-bill there as you look on? I know it's not been a good indicator, but what do you see the book-to-bill there on industrial side? Jerald Fishman I don't have that data. We don't break it down by industry segment. I'm sorry we don't have that data. Operator And the next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG Jerry, you mentioned in your prepared comments, that you missed some revenue opportunity in the July quarter out of the COGS infrastructure business. Jerald Fishman Yes. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG Component shortage of wafers. I'm kind of curious, how much was that and do you expect to make that back in the October quarter? Jerald Fishman The first answer is simpler than the second one. The first answer was probably 40% of the revenue miss. And I think over time, you'll make that back and over time's what happens with the ultimate demand from those customers. But it was a fairly significant number. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG Jerry was that 40% of the low end of guide or to the midpoint? Jerald Fishman To the midpoint. David Zinsner Yes, to the midpoint. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG And then guys when you look at the midpoint of guidance for the October quarter, can you help me understand what normal linearity is for this quarter, and does the midpoint assume normal linearity? Or do you expect that you're not going to see what I would expect to be relatively stronger months in September and October? Jerald Fishman Typically, I think Dave alluded to this earlier. We see August being relatively weak, particularly in Europe. And then we see a stronger September and a much longer October. That's typically the linearity of the quarter and that's the linearity that we're planning on for this quarter. Operator And the final question is from David Wu with Indaba Global Research. David Wu - Global Crown Jerry, a quick question on geography. If I were to look at your business, Europe, Western Europe, United States and Japan, if you add up those 3  up, how much of that business would it be and correspondingly, what about those \"merchant markets,\" how big are those in terms of your total revenue mix? Jerald Fishman I will delegate that to David who has all the numbers. David Zinsner It's David, I'm sorry. I missed what you said. What were the components of the one you wanted... David Wu - Global Crown Well, U.S., Europe, Western Europe and Japan. Can you give any idea what percentage of the business that is? And if you look at the BRIC countries, the Brazil, Indias and Chinas, how big could that be? David Zinsner Okay so basically about 50% -- if I mention this correctly, but 50% of our revenue came from the U.S. and Europe and the rest of North America. If you add Japan, that's another 13% and the rest of China and Asia Pac. Mindy Kohl Okay. That concludes our Q&amp;A session. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again during our Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call scheduled for November 21 beginning at 5:00 p.m. Thanks very much.

With that, I'll turn it over to our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald Fishman Well, good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on the first quarter conference call. The first quarter for ADI was another very good quarter across virtually every dimension. Despite fears of a possible very significant inventory correction and the continued economic uncertainty in many regions of the world, our revenue for the first quarter was at the levels that we had predicted three months ago, and the trends within each end market were mostly also right on target. Specifically, our revenues in the first quarter were $729 million, which were up 21% year-over-year and down about 5% sequentially, which was slightly above the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. Our order trends during the quarter were very typical of what we experienced in the first fiscal quarter of our fiscal years. We saw some weakness in late November and December, consistent with the holiday-related shutdowns of our customers and also, of course, some inventory reductions, which was followed by a strong January. For the quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was approximately one, and our backlog increased slightly entering the second quarter. In addition, the order levels from our OEM customers increased from fourth quarter levels indicating that business conditions are stabilizing and in some cases improving. Clearly, we did not see this significant inventory correction at ADI that we all feared. We believe this was a direct result of our manufacturing strategy, which kept lead times short through the entire cycle and kept inventory levels at our distributors within historical norms. Customers were confident in our ability to deliver and as a result, there was little excess inventory in the supply chain. In addition, feedback from many of our largest customers indicates that they are optimistic about their business going forward, and their inventories appear to be in good control. Those comments in the recent order trend that we've seen provide us some comfort that we can achieve sequential revenue growth in the second fiscal quarter and hopefully, we can continue to see strength for the balance of the year. So now I'll turn the call over to Dave, who is going to provide you some more details about our financial results. David Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, first quarter revenues were $729 million, declining 5% sequentially, but increasing 21% from last year. Gross margins were slightly above guidance at 66.2% in the first quarter, compared to 67% in the prior quarter. Gross margins declined modestly as a result of lower levels of production at our internal fabs and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses for the first quarter were $223 million, and that was an $8 million or 3.4% sequential decline from the prior quarter. In the first quarter, we benefited from our lower and more variable operating expense structure and in particular, from lower variable compensation payments versus the fourth quarter. Our operating margins held up very well despite the sequential revenue decline. Operating profits for the first quarter were $259 million or 35.6% of sales, down only slightly from our record 37.1% of sales in the prior quarter and a result of continued strength in gross margins and lower operating expenses. Other expenses was approximately $600,000, and that was compared to $2.3 million of other income in the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of having recorded a one-time gain on the sale of some unused real estate in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate for continuing operations was 16.7% this quarter versus 21.9% in the prior quarter. The decline was due to a few one-time tax benefit items, including the reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit for calendar year 2010. Excluding these tax-related benefit items, our tax rate was 21.7%, and we expect that will continue for the remainder of 2011. Our weighted average share count was 309 million shares. We repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares or $114 million of ADI stock this quarter. However, the share count increased in the quarter as a result of the higher stock price and our stock option exercise activity being a little bit more robust than usual. Going forward, we anticipate that we will continue to be active buyers of ADI stock. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.70 compared to $0.73 in the prior quarter. Excluding one-time tax benefit items, non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.66. Diluted EPS from the gain on the sale of discontinued operations was $0.02 at the time of the sale of the cellular handset radio and baseband chipset business to MediaTek in the first fiscal quarter of 2008. We placed $10 million of the sale proceeds in escrow. These funds were released to ADI in the first quarter of 2011 and as a result, in Q1, we had a gain from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $6.5 million or $0.02 per share. Our cash generation continue to be strong as we generated 30% of our revenue or $217 million in operating cash flow, and our cash balance is now approximately $3 billion versus $2.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Net cash at the end of the first quarter was approximately $2.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $26 million, and that resulted in free cash flow of $191 million or 26% of revenue for the quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per outstanding share of common stock that will be paid on March 23, 2011, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2011. Our accounts receivable balance decreased sequentially by approximately 1%, and our days sales outstanding increased by two days to 48 days in the first quarter. All of our customers are current to their terms. In anticipation of a stronger second quarter, inventory on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter increased by 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter, and our days of inventory were 105 days. Our distributor inventory also increased by 2% in anticipation of a stronger quarter for the second quarter. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remain similar to last quarter and are in good control, with 98% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within six weeks and 99% within eight weeks. All in all, the quarter was right on plan across virtually every operating metric. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, who will discuss the results from each of our end markets and provide our short-term outlook. Jerald Fishman Well, with regard to our market segment performance in the first quarter, I'll first talk about the industrial market. For the first quarter, our revenues from the very broad and diversified industrial market, which is 46% of our total revenues, declined 3% sequentially to $337 million, which is very much in line with typical seasonal patterns we see in our first quarter. In the industrial market, where we sell literally thousands of products to tens of thousands of customers, and our technology is often a differentiator in our customers end products. We believe that ADI continues to have an excellent opportunity to be the leading supplier in each of the application areas that we serve in the industrial market. Driven by our customers needs for increased energy efficiency, industrial automation and advanced instrumentation, we're seeing demand for ADI's high-performance signal processing technology not only in the newer areas such as energy and building automation, but also with more traditional I&amp;I application areas. We're also seeing growth opportunities in the Asian markets as customers build out factory automation infrastructure, social infrastructure and energy management systems. And we expect that this trend will continue to drive our growth in industrial revenues for ADI. Overall, we believe that the industrial market offers strong growth opportunities for ADI, and we expect it will resume sequential growth in our second fiscal quarter, a prediction that is supported by seasonal patterns as well as by leading industrial customers, who have reported to us that they believe that the underlying conditions in their markets are solid. Within the industrial category, healthcare presents an extremely strong growth opportunity for ADI. During the first quarter, healthcare revenues actually increased sequentially as a result of our significant new product portfolio and competitive strength in imaging and patient monitoring and in instrumentation applications. In addition, we believe that healthcare sales are benefiting to some degree from the pent-up demand that goes up during the credit crisis when capital spending was severely reduced. We expect continued growth in the healthcare revenues in Q2 and solid expansion through the year as our strategic customers are optimistic about their growth prospects for 2011. Overall, we expect the number of trends to continue to increase demand for ADI technology in the healthcare market. Among these are an increasing need for higher speed and channel count in medical imaging systems to improve image resolution and throughput while achieving a lower cost per channel; to drive for improved measurement performance to increase diagnostic accuracy; the expansion of telemedicine and the requirements for portability as well as the inclusion of secured communications capabilities in healthcare application; and finally, the requirements for patient safety and system reliability. Revenues from our automotive customers were approximately $95 million in Q1, an increase of approximately 1% from Q4. This was a record for our Automotive business. Q1 marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which we've grown our Automotive business, and with our annual run rate now approaching $400 million, we're now deriving 13% of our total revenues from the automotive market. Leveraging our strength, along the signal chain in centers with signal conditioning, data converters and DSPs, ADI has developed a very compelling product portfolio in the areas of safety, infotainment and powertrain applications. This portfolio, along with a much more robust automotive market, continues to drive our automotive success. We expect continued growth in automotive revenues in our second quarter and believe that we'll continue to benefit from favorable macro trends within the automotive space in the areas of active and passive safety, of fuel efficiency and convenience, all of which drive higher dollar content for ADI. As an example, our very sophisticated lithium-ion battery monitoring products for both hybrid and electric vehicles are achieving expanding market penetration. We expect that these applications will present a particularly attractive opportunity for ADI due to the very complex nature of the signal processing challenge and the anticipated unit growth of hybrid and electric vehicles. In summary, the automotive market continues to represent an attractive growth opportunity for ADI as we have the momentum from both an increasing build of material value for vehicle and also increasing market share for ADI. Communications revenues, at $163 million in the first quarter, were down 8% versus our Q4 levels and accounted for 22% of our total sales in Q1. Wireless infrastructure sales declined as expected and were reflective of the completion of the TD-SCDMA Phase 4 rollout in China. This was partially offset by good strength in North America and Europe as a result of significant bandwidth enhancements being deployed in these regions. In addition, in Q1, our sales of wired infrastructure products grew sequentially as the build out of fixed networks continue to increase in response to the data communications demand being generated by mobile networks. In the short term, we expect our communications revenues to be flat to up slightly in Q2, with continuing strength in North America and Europe, offset by ongoing weakness in China-based deployments. However, by the second half of our fiscal year, we expect the next phase of deployments in China to begin, which should reaccelerate our growth in this segment. Over the longer term, we expect that communications infrastructure will remain a key area of opportunity for ADI. Just recently, one of our major customers, Ericsson, described mobile subscriber growth as a very key driver for wireless infrastructure capital spending, estimating that the number of global broadband subscriptions will reach 1 billion this year and top 3.8 billion by 2015. In addition, the ever increasing need for higher bandwidth to support the dramatic increases in video demand pushes this need even further. Going forward, the need for higher performance radios to support multiple communication standards, higher density of channels to support increased data payloads, new form factors in hard-to-reach places, improved power efficiency, smaller footprints and lower cost per channel are all the trends that we anticipate will drive growth for ADI and help us to continue to build on our leadership position in the communications market. Consumer revenues, while exceeding our very conservative internal plan that we had for Q1, were down approximately 12% sequentially primarily due to seasonality and overall weak consumer spending. In Q1, revenues from consumer customers were $121 million and accounted for 17% of our total revenues. We are currently expecting a lift of consumer revenues in Q2 above our Q1 levels basically from applications for cameras and home entertainment products, which are entering a historically stronger seasonal period in Q2 compared to Q1. We also continue to be very well positioned in a few niche consumer applications in the portable space and in the gaming area. Overall, we're planning for our consumer revenues to grow in the second quarter. And finally, our computing revenues were down 4% sequentially, representing just 2% of our total revenues. As I'm sure you're aware, the computing market is not a space where ADI is applying R&amp;D resource. On a regional basis, our revenues declined sequentially in all regions in Q1, in line with our original expectations. So now let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2011 and make a few comments about the longer term. Based on the stabilization in orders that we saw in the first quarter and positive feedback across our customer base, we are planning for revenue growth to resume in the second quarter. Specifically, we're planning for our second quarter revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million, which is approximately flat to up 4% sequentially, and up 9% to 14% on a year-over-year basis. We're also planning for our gross margins to increase slightly to approximately 66.5% of sales based on the current mix assumptions that are built into our plan, and for our operating expenses to grow a few percent sequentially, primarily as a result of annual salary increases, which took effect at the beginning of the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we're planning for our expenses to grow slower than our revenues. On an earnings per share basis, we anticipate that our diluted earnings per share from our continuing operations for the quarter will be in the range of $0.65 to $0.69. Looking out further than the second quarter, we remain very confident about the long-term prospects for ADI. We've been operating under a new organizational structure, which divides the business into market segments and technology groups now for more than a year. We believe this model has enhanced our understanding of critical applications technology and customer needs and will continue to make us more effective in developing products that will push the envelope of signal processing technology. Most recently, we also embarked on a new initiative inside ADI to improve the effectiveness of our new product development spending. We believe that through this process, we'll drive more growth out of the R&amp;D dollars that we're currently investing within ADI. As a result of our strong product portfolio and many of these new initiatives to enhance the productivity of our investments, we believe that our objective to grow our revenues long term in the range of 8% to 12% that we communicated well over a year ago is both realistic and achievable. We've also fundamentally adjusted our cost structure to drive more profitability, and we made our model much more variable than historically, which allows our profits to be much more reactive to changes in revenues. We've already seen the benefits of this approach in our first quarter results, where operating margins were above 35% despite a 5% sequential revenue decline. The end result, we now believe, is a business that achieves very solid growth and very attractive margins and drives very significant free cash flow and ultimately, very good returns for our stockholders. Mindy Kohl Thank you, Jerry. During today's Q&amp;A period, please limit yourself to one primary question and no more than one follow-on question. We'll give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we're now ready for questions.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Jerry, let me just ask you, the year seems to have started very well for ADI with year-on-year revenue growth now at 20.8%. As we look through the rest of the year, within the context of your guidance of 8% to 12% as kind of the longer term target, what areas do you think will be the strongest growing for you through the rest of this year? I know if you recall, the light comm [ph] equipment and automotive. But if I to look through your business, what area do you think we should be looking at maybe as a strength and areas that may will worry a little bit in terms of the outlook? Jerald Fishman Well, I think overall, the industrial market continues to represent one of the best opportunities for ADI. This is no longer a stodgy 3% growth business. This is a business that grew strongly last year and the year before, and in fact, over the last three or four years. There are many, many segments within industrial that are growing very quickly. The fact that even after the very significant growth that we had in industrial products in 2010, that we actually only declined 3% in Q1, which is seasonally a very weak quarter because there's less days in distribution and so on. To us, it's a very good sign that -- it's not that that business is going to grow 35% a year or like whatever up there [ph] we grew last year. But that's a solid growth for us. And I expect that if the economies tend to hold and at the pace they are being made, I think the Industrial business will be a very strong business for us. We've talked at some length about the Automotive business. That business has been one of the higher growth businesses for us as the portfolio keeps getting richer across applications in cars that tend to be in very high demand right now. So I think that business should be strong through the year. The Communications business has really been a mixed picture with the infrastructure in China being weaker in the first half. But the feedback we get is that's going to strengthen. And certainly, the wired part of our Communications business, which is much more dependent on penetration than the end equipment sales right now, should also grow. Now probably the remaining largest I've known is what happens in the Consumer businesses. And we have strong positions, but ultimately, that will be dependent on what consumers actually do. So that's about the best information we have about the rest of the year based on what we know right now. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Jerry, any sense of where -- I know you said the inventory correction is behind us and that you've seen some pickup in OEM orders... Jerald Fishman I said I believe it's behind us. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank You believe it's behind you, absolutely. In terms of what we're seeing with distributors, any comment as to where the level of inventory is now related to historical levels and in terms of order stabilization? I believe the comments you made applies to both disti [distribution] and to OEMs. I just want to clarify that. David Zinsner So answering your second question, Uche, yes, the stabilization of the order pattern happened in both the disti and OEM space. The disti inventory continues to look to be in pretty good shape, and their days of inventory are running kind of in the eight weeks that they normally target. Its only up a couple percent from last quarter really just gearing up for what we believe will be a stronger second quarter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Roughly what percentage of your revenues come from product made of foundries versus internally? And can you give us some idea as to the difference in gross margin between foundry and internally sourced product? David Zinsner It's roughly 50-50. About 50% of our revenue was derived from products manufactured internally, 50% externally. Gross margins are a little bit higher, obviously, internally. But that has more to do with the mix of products that we produce internally. It tends to be more geared to industrial products that tends to be our highest gross margin products in the company. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen. [Citigroup] Bin Jiang This is Bin speaking for Terence. My first question, I have a quick follow-up on the healthcare, and you comment a lot of opportunity in the healthcare. Can you give us some perspective how much growth you think will happen? And how much percentage healthcare account for as a percentage of total sales? Jerald Fishman Sorry. There's a lot of noise on that. I couldn't hear the second half of your question? Bin Jiang Second half, how much is healthcare account for the total percentage of sales? David Zinsner Percent of revenue. It's roughly in the mid single digits as a percent of total. And what was the first part of the question? Bin Jiang So what growth rates do you expect for healthcare for the full year fiscal 2011? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, we don't really make predictions by market segments here. It's just we don't have enough data to be accurate about it. But I think it's fair to say that when we look at the plans for that business for this year, we expect that to be a pretty good grower for us, both in an absolute sense and relative to many other products. Bin Jiang My second question is on CapEx. So CapEx in the first quarter was down from the fourth quarter last year. Do you expect deceleration of CapEx for the year 2011, or it could be fairly flat at $25 million or $26 million? David Zinsner It's going to run around this range. We roughly target CapEx to be somewhere in the 3% to 4% of revenue. I suspect every quarter, we'll run somewhere in that range. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co Can you just talk about what the utilization rates are right now, and where those are going and what your inventory plans are? David Zinsner So utilization for first quarter was up 75%. That was down from about 80% in the prior quarter. We're expecting it, obviously, to pick up as we expect revenues to be up in the second quarter. I'd say it will be up a few percentage points. On the inventory side, we took inventories up to 105 days, also in anticipation of a stronger second quarter. Our goal is really to kind of keep it in the 100-day range. So we're going to try to target bringing the days of inventory back down, closer to 100 over the course of this year. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co And as my follow up, can you just talk about the various gross margin drivers going forward? David Zinsner Sure. I mean, I think the primary driver is going to be, obviously, utilization and revenue growth. As we grow sales, we will obviously be increasing production. Also, we have an amount of fixed expense within the cost of sales that when sales increase, that's beneficial to the gross margins. I think that's the biggest single driver for gross margins going forward. Obviously, from quarter-to-quarter, the mix will certainly impact it. But mix tends to be a fairly minor driver of gross margins. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. This is Kate Kotlarsky for Jim Covello. Wanted to dig a little bit into the automotive part of the business. Clearly, that's doing very well now, and I was hoping you can talk a little bit about what you're expecting for the business throughout the course of the year and maybe talk about it from a geographic perspective. I know that China is one area that's been doing very well. Maybe you can comment kind of as you move through the year what geographies you expect to be contributing more meaningfully to the business. Jerald Fishman Well, think it's really a combination of each location. We typically sell to the OEMs that build systems for companies. So if you look at the largest automotive suppliers for the large OEMs, the geography gets a little confusing because you have OEMs that are in Europe that supplies both Europe and America and other places, even China in some cases. So the geographic part isn't the most relevant part given that each of our suppliers has a worldwide business. But I would say that in aggregate, most of our OEMs that we sell to in the Automotive business are enthusiastic about the balance of the year. The volumes they are seeing are good, the desire for more electronics and more safety features, and we're selling parts that go into stability control systems, which are becoming part of legislation in many locations. So I mean, we're enthusiastic about that business. I can't quote you a growth rate and what's going to happen in any particular quarter and particularly those in the far future. But this business has become a good business for us. It's up there at $90 million or $100 million a quarter. It's been growing. We have good customers. And those programs with automotive manufacturers tend to be ones that take a long time to get. Once you get them, you keep them, unless you really screw it up. And we have a very good reputation with automotive customers, not only for the quality of our technology, but also the long-term reliability of our product, which is really important to those guys. So in automotive, we're continuing to put money into it. We're continuing to build the internal systems in the company to be a great supplier to the automotive customers. And so it's like anything else to Analog, it's not the only thing, and I can't even say it's the most important thing. But it's one of the drivers that we've been doing well at, and we think we'll continue to do well at. Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. If we were to think about it from a content perspective and how your content at your customers in the Automotive segment has changed over time, where are we today in terms of your content? And do you have an expectation of where we might be a year from now? Jerald Fishman Well, it's hard to put a dollar number per car on this thing if that's what you're after. But our penetration in the automotive market, if you go back five, six, seven years ago, it was mostly airbag sensors. And we were a very important and high market shareholder, still are today, on airbag sensors and micromachine accelerometers. So I think our business in automotive has really expanded in a couple of different dimensions. Firstly, we're continuing to do all the safety stuff. We have a large business supply in automotive accelerometers. We also now are supplying micromachine gyroscopes for stability control applications and many other safety applications in cars. But also, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we're supplying a lot of parts into engine management. We're supplying battery management. We're supplying a lot of our DSPs that go into some of the high-end entertainment systems. So it's really a combination of sensors that just make a car run better to things that actually save energy to things that sound good to things that hopefully, save a lot of lives. There's a lot of people now on the stability control application, I believe, that stability control is more important than crash sensors because more people die when the car tips over and crashes into somebody. So that's really an emerging market for semiconductor sensors, and I think our gyroscope is a pretty good product in there. So I think it's in many, many different dimensions, but it's very hard to put a specific dollar content on it. But it's quite a bit many multiples of what it used to be. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital. Sameer Kalucha This is Sameer Kalucha calling in for Tim Luke. I just wanted to get a sense of the comm infrastructure space. I just wanted to get a feel of how is the contribution from China, North America and Europe relative to each other? And how do you see India 3G contributing to this growth going forward? Jerald Fishman Well, again, you have to be a little careful on where the parts are board and where the parts are shipped. I think the amount of sales we have in China is not a huge amount of our sales in infrastructure despite common belief that that's the predominant part of our business. It's not today. But I tell you that a lot of -- and even within that sector or geography, a lot of products that are built by the Chinese base station manufacturers are shipped outside of China. So the geographies are a little confusing on that. I think our business is very well balanced between China, the U.S., Europe. And I think that's why even when the TD-SCDMA application goes a little cold for a couple of quarters, our Communications business still stays very strong. Sameer Kalucha And maybe a little follow-up on that. In terms of LTE, how is the deployment you're seeing out there? And I wonder, how does LTE impact the Comm results for you going forward? And does it drive back better ASPs, better volumes? Jerald Fishman I mean, each standard, as they get better, takes higher and more signal processing content. So that business is certainly not sort of a stable business. Each generation, when it went from 2G to 3G and 3G to 4G and to any other standard that comes along, the speeds are higher, the density is higher and that requires higher performance products. So I think all those trends tend to be very favorable for us. Sameer Kalucha And the ASP difference between 3G and LTE for... Jerald Fishman It varies widely by how many radio cards actually were in every system. That's more the driver of that and the particular ASP. We get in any particular card because the configurations are so different. So I can't really give you a firm number on that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Jerry, as you look at the potential for 8% to 12% growth this year, what are the key swing factors that would bring you in more towards the lower end of that range versus the higher end of that range? Jerald Fishman Well, it's all the things everybody fears and hopes for, on either side of that question. There's always concerns that, yes, there's still more inventory out there and what we're seeing isnt real. That's certainly not our belief now, but that can certainly be the case. And we could see a complete collapse of consumer spending. We could see interest rates going up and people starting to cut back on capital spending. I mean, there's a long list of bogeymen out there that we worry about a lot. On the other hand, that's certainly not what our customers are telling us. So it depends on whether you want to be enthusiastic or pessimistic about it, but we just look at the trends. We listen carefully to what the customers are telling us. We had very good feedback from the largest customers in each of the segments that we serve. Amazingly, in Q1, the numbers, with all the complicated things that were going on and all the conflicting signals out there, I mean, we came in right down the middle, not only on the total, but within the segment, so it was pretty close. So we don't know any more than that. We just know. We follow the trends. We look very close to large customers. And we integrate all that, come up with a number for next quarter, and that's about all we can do. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company And then you had mentioned that the company's implementing a new approach to looking at and tracking new product efficacy. Can you talk about when you'd expect that new approach to start to yield some payouts that investors would be able to recognize? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, the real challenge for us is ADI spends about $500 million a year in R&amp;D. If you can get more output for every dollar of input, it's very profitable and it'd be very appealing to investors. So we've been working not so much on the creative part of that, which is always something we work on. But there's a lot of systematic parts to getting new products out. And there is, like in every company, we have some that sell and some that don't. And there's always the challenge of figuring out those in advance rather than after the fact. So I think we are looking at each of the businesses very carefully. We're looking where the productivity in the R&amp;D is the highest. We're trying to emulate the practices in those businesses in the parts where the R&amp;D productivity has not been good. And we're trying to make changes to reflect the best practices in the company. But certainly, early on the best way you can do that is really understand where it is, that the productivity is the highest and where it isn't and how do you fix the places that aren't and make them look like the places that are. So I don't think there's anything magical here. It's just when we look forward, one of the greatest opportunities for sales growth in Analog is getting more productivity out of the R&amp;D we're spending. We're spending plenty of money on R&amp;D, and we're getting good results out of it. And the payback, obviously, with the margins we're running is pretty good. But I think it could be better, and we're going to work hard to get there. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company And is that one of the things that gives you confidence that you can keep expense growth growing noticeably slower than revenue growth? Jerald Fishman Yes, that's certainly the way we're going to get there. I mean, it's easy to quote those statistics and say, \"Well, we're going to grow sales higher than expected.\" But we don't like to say that until we got to be to how we're going to do that. Much the same way as, when we said we're going to get the margins of the business up and everybody asked lightly, is that just the usual CEO stuff and CFO stuff. You really got some ideas how to do it? And we said we wouldn't have said it if we didnt have ideas, and we wouldn't talk about the sales growth rate if we didn't have some ideas on how to get there. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates First question was just on how we should think about seasonality ahead of a pretty decent guide at least relative to expectations here. Can we still expect to get your sort of sequential growth in the following couple of quarters given the strength in this quarter? To mean, was this quarter unusual, or should we sort of expect the usual going forward? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, we'll just have to wait and see. I mean, nobody has really a phenomenal visibility into what happens six months or nine months or a year from now. So everyone just has guesses. Certainly, that's what we hope would happen, and there are reasons to believe it might happen. But we're struggling to get the numbers right for next quarter first. That's our most important thing, and to plan the company around a set of numbers that we can meet. And so when you look out further than that, it's really just speculation at this point. So I think we'll have to all sit around and hold our breath and wait and see what happens this quarter, and then we'll give you a sense of what's likely to happen sort of after that. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates And as my follow up, Jerry, maybe you could talk a little bit about the design win process on the Auto business? Are you finding that when you go in, you're pretty much dominating a bigger set of sockets where you maybe, for example, maybe have your gyroscope and you're pretty much always winning 100% of that business? Or is the competitive landscape such that you'll win some, but there'll be a second source and then in the next platform, you'll sort of switch with that competitor? Just go through that a little bit. Jerald Fishman Sure. Well, I think it's much more a design-sensitive business with long product life cycles than, let's say, some of the other applications and consumer products who spend that much faster design cycles. So we approach the Automotive business with a mentality that says, \"If we can do something nobody else can do and do it better and do it at pretty good margins, then that's a good business for us.\" And if we're going to be in the Automotive business, we'd need two [ph] products that there's four people and then they line them up against the wall and they take the lowest price, long term, that's not going to be a great business for us. It may be a great business for the companies. So we're really trying to push the technology window and provide very innovative technology at a reasonable price to customers and not focus on applications that every six months or a year are out for bid. And we've been successful doing that. If we do a good job for the customers, I think they'll stick with us in that business. And if we don't, they'll look for alternatives. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Gleacher &amp; Company. Doug Freedman - Gleacher &amp; Company, Inc. If I could sort of focus a little bit more on the near term and what you're seeing in terms of booking profiles, what type of visibility are customers willing to give you, and what are you feeling like your channel partners are willing to say and do as far as carrying inventory now and going forward for the balance of the year? Jerald Fishman Well, with our channel partners, as I think we've mentioned in the past, we tend to set their inventory levels more than they do. We listen very respectfully to what they want, and then we look at what they're going to sell through. And that's how we provide inventory towards and that's how we've done it through both the up and the down cycle. As far as large customers go, they give us a forecast. Some of our customers, we ship into a warehouse and they pull out from that warehouse. But we get those numbers very frequently, and we keep a pretty good balance on that. Generally, the conversion rates that we see from the large OEM customers that pull from hubs or central [ph] inventory points, is actually very good. So we usually have a pretty good beat on what our OEM customers' going to take for the quarter. I don't know if that helps you, but that's the best I can do. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research First one, just on the OpEx. Will your variable compensation program be the only driver of any OpEx increase through the back half of the year, so in Q3 and Q4? Or do you anticipate any further investments in OpEx beyond what the variable comp program would drive? Jerald Fishman Well, I think as long as revenues keep growing, which we'll have to wait and see how that goes, we are making strategic hires in various parts of the business. So I don't think it will be the only driver, but it'll be one driver and the one that reacts the quickest to what happens. But we keep a very tight fist on hiring new people, but we're in some very exciting growth businesses. We got to put some more resource into some of the businesses. We tend to balance that out with other business that we put less resource in. But I think in aggregate, if business stays strong, we'll probably do some hiring as we did last quarter in some of the most important businesses we have. But on the other hand, we've got a pretty good hammer on making sure it doesn't run away with us, and it keeps under very tight control because we are still, I believe, we got more leverage out of us. Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research And one question on your gross margin, specifically your incremental gross margin. So I think in maybe 10 years or so before the downturn hit at least, I think your incremental gross margin was about 65%. Meaning, about $0.65 on average of every incremental dollar revenue that you earned or lost fell to the gross margin line. At this point, given the structural improvements that you've made in your gross margin, do you have a feeling for how much higher your incremental gross margin might be now versus where it was maybe a couple of years ago? Jerald Fishman I'll turn it over to our erstwhile CFO. David Zinsner Well, it's a difficult question to answer only because half our business comes from products manufactured mostly externally. And so we don't get a lot of incremental lift for increased revenue on those parts of our business. But obviously, in the internal side, we do get a fair amount of incremental margin when production revenues increased. So it's certainly higher than the 66% or thereabouts gross margins we're running on the incremental basis to be close to 80% probably on average. Certainly, on products that are higher than that and if the mix is higher towards internal, then it would be higher than that. If the mix is more towards the external, then it would obviously be lower than that. Jerald Fishman Obviously, when the Industrial business grows the fastest, that's when we get our highest incremental gross margins. Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research Do you think it's not in line to think that $0.80 of every $1 that you've earned in revenue growth could potentially fall to your gross margin line? David Zinsner That's a rough order of magnitude, but obviously, it's mix dependent. Operator Your final question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research I was wondering if you guys could -- if you have a sense of where you think you're getting the most design traction and winning share in terms of component categories and end markets? And then I have a follow-up. Jerald Fishman I would say that there's no one area in product or one area in markets that really sticks out. I think we have good design traction in all the market segments that we're investing in. We stopped putting R&amp;D into the Computer business, so I would say we're getting a ton of design wins there. But we're putting in the R&amp;D, our traction is very good across all the market segments and certainly, most of the product segments. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research And then can you give us a sense of where your turns are versus history for your last quarter and what you're expecting for this quarter? David Zinsner Again, that's a number that's difficult to quantify given that half our backlog or more than half our backlog is from disti, and we don't obviously recognize revenue when we ship. But if you kind of did a back-of-the-napkin analysis, it's very similar to last quarter sort of on a rough order magnitude basis and kind of on the lower end of historical norms. Jerald Fishman I mean, typically, the turns business is somewhere inversely proportional to the lead times. So if you keep your lead times short, customers tend to believe they can get product quicker so there's more turns business and less inventory. If your lead times go out, just the opposite happens. So I think the only way you can ever win in this game is keep the lead time short, or else, you really don't have a clue of what's going on. Mindy Kohl Okay. That concludes our Q&amp;A session.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices Beats on Earnings, Offers Weak Outlook - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices  fiscal fourth quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, or 4.1%. Revenue beat by 1.9%. Results touched the high-end of management expectations on revenue and gross margin, but exceeded on the operating margin line. Despite the solid results, Analog Devices shares were down slightly  in after-hours trading, as investors discounted investments in the sector. We also note that while earnings continue to beat the Zacks Consensus, the surprise percentage has been trending down over the past 4 quarters. This explains the reason for the relatively small movement in Analog Devices share prices in response to the earnings announcement. Revenue Analog Devices' revenue of $770.0 million was up 6.9% sequentially, 34.7% year over year and at the high end of managements revenue guidance of $740-770 million . The communications and automotive end-markets grew the strongest on a sequential basis and computing was the only area that actually saw a decline. Growth was fairly broad-based across geographies, with the Americas and Japan registering the biggest increases.  Revenue by End Market The industrial market generated 45% of Analog Devices total revenue , driven by energy and healthcare sectors, as well as increasing demand from Analog Devices broad base of smaller scale industrial customers. Energy efficiency, productivity enhancements and security are fueling the increased spending in the segment. Europe, Japan and China were responsible for the growth in the last quarter. Communications generated 23% of total revenue, increasing 16.6% sequentially and 47.8% year over year. Analog Devices communications business comes from both infrastructure and cell phones, although the focus is on the infrastructure side. Analog Devices did not provoide specific commentary regarding the wireline infrastructure business, stating that wireless infrastructure was the major driver of revenue in the last quarter. The TDS CDMA phase 4 rollout in China and the gradual replacement of GSM by 3G fueled growth in the last quarter. With mobile operators racing to meet increasing data needs and improving the efficiency of their networks, demand for networking applications in the U.S. is also on the rise. Analog Devices converters, amplifiers and RF products are solidly positioned across all fast-growing geographies  and should generate very substantial growth for the company. The smartphone business also grew in the last quarter and management stated that Analog Devices products were well-received by customers. Consumer generated 18% of Analog Devices revenue. Segment revenue was up 5.3% sequentially but down 5.1% from a year ago, reflective of caution at customers in this segment. Portable media products, digital cameras and other consumer electronics products drove the sequential increase. The automotive segment  generated around 12% of Analog Devices revenue, growing 11.8% sequentially and 30.8% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase in the last quarter was driven by a more robust automotive market, which came off a seasonally weaker period. The main drivers here continue to be the global recovery, as well as increasing electronic content per vehicle, especially in the areas of infotainment, safety and fuel efficiency. This, along with increasing demand for high-end vehicles that use Analog Devices products are positives for the company. Analog Devices expressed optimism regarding its ability to continue increasing the dollar content per vehicle, as safety, fuel efficiency and conveniences become essential features of vehicles.  Computing accounted for the remaining 2% of Analog Devices revenue, down 5.7% sequentially and up 3.8% year over year. Management has taken a policy decision to avoid this market, since it is given to commoditization, making margin expansion difficult. Revenue by Product Line Both analog and DSP products witnessed strong double-digit growth from the year-ago quarter. Analog signal processing products  were up 7.3% sequentially and 34.3% year over year. Converters, amplifier and other analog products all contributed to the sequential increase. Converters are the largest product line, with a revenue share of over 46%. Power management and reference products generated 7% of revenue, up 4.2% sequentially and 54.9% year over year. The strength in this product line is the result of managements refocusing of the business over the past couple of years, as well as the ongoing recovery across all served markets.  Digital signal processing products  were up 5.1% sequentially and 27.5% year over year. Margins Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 67.0%, up 38 basis points  sequentially, 1,074 bps year over year and at the high end of managements guidance of 66-67%. Gross margins have expanded sequentially in each of the last five quarters. Gross margin improvements continue to come from higher volumes that enable better utilization rates, as well as a more favorable mix of business. Analog Devices expressed confidence that there remains further leverage in the model. Operating expenses of $230.5 million were flat sequentially and up 19.1% from the October quarter of 2009. However, the operating margin increased 224 bps sequentially and 1,465 bps year over year to 37.1%, better than Analog Devices expectations of 35-36%. Both R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses declined as a percentage of sales, contributing almost equally to the margin expansion in the last quarter. Of course, the stronger gross margin also helped. The pro forma net income was $225.0 million, or a 29.2% net income margin compared to $200.3 million, or 27.8% in the previous quarter and $105.6 million, or a 18.5% net income margin in the prior-year quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were $0.73 compared to $0.65 in the previous quarter and $0.36 in the October quarter of last year. The EPS was also better than managements expectations of $0.68 to $0.72. Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters mentioned above, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same. Balance Sheet Inventories increased 4.6% to $277.5 million, with annualized inventory turns increasing slightly from 3.6X to 3.7X reported at the end of the last quarter. Days sales outstanding  went up from 45 to 46. Cash generated from operations was around $274.3 million. The company spent $37.8 million on capex and $65.6 million on cash dividends and $35.8 million on share repurchases in the last quarter. The Board of Directors of Analog Devices authorised the purchase of an additional $1 billion worth of share repurchases. Guidance Analog Devices stated that while end markets continued to look strong, the company was likely to see higher turns in the business and lower backlog accumulation in the following quarter. This is expected to fetch revenues of $715-740 million, representing a sequential decline of 4-7%, or a year-over-year increase of 19-23%. Gross margins are expected to come in at 66% and operating margins at 34.5-35.5%, resulting in earnings per share of $0.63-$0.67. Therefore, not just revenue, but margins and net earnings are also expected to decline from the October quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of $0.63 a share when Analog Devices reported, which was the low end of the guided range. Our Recommendation Analog Devices shares currently have a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short term Hold recommendation. This is similar to its peers Microsemi Corporation , Fairchild Semiconductor  and Semtech Corporation , which also has a Zacks #3 Rank. The recommendations for the group are not so much because of weak demand, but more because of a stabilization in the growth rate. We do not expect very strong growth rates over the next few quarters for any of these companies, given that initial pent-up demand during the recession has largely been met.

"content": "  By Mike YamamotoAnalog Devices  has been on a scorching run for several months but drew downside option activity yesterday as it faces a multi-year resistance level.optionMONSTER's Depth Charge system shows that 2,233 February 38 puts traded in a strong buying pattern, most of them going for $0.40. Open interest at the strike was fewer than 294 contracts, so the puts were bought to open new positions.ADI closed at 0.6 percent to $39.62, a day after it reached its highest price since July 2007. The chipmaker is up more than 40 percent since last August but is now on the cusp of resistance around $40 that it has tested unsuccessfully many times going all the way back to August 2004 .Yesterday's put buying was not tied to any stock trading that we saw, though it could be protection on a previous long position. It could also be a straight bearish bet that ADI will fall soon.In any case, the puts will be profitable if the stock falls more than 5 percent by the time they expire on Feb. 18. The company is looking at two major catalysts before then, its first-quarter earnings results after the market closes on Feb. 15 and a presentation at the Goldman Sachs Technology &amp; Internet Conference on Feb. 17. Analog Devices will also appear at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference on March 3.

F2Q09 Earnings Call May 19, 2009 5:00 PM ETOperator At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices fiscal second quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Miss Kohl, you may begin your conference. Mindy Kohl Good afternoon everyone. This is Mindy Kohl, Director of Investor Relations for Analog Devices. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you have not yet seen our second quarter fiscal 2009 release, you can access it by visiting our website at www.analog.com and clicking on the headline on the home page. This conference call is also being broadcast live on the Internet. From analog.com, select Investor Relations and follow the instructions shown next to the microphone icon. A recording of this call will be available today within about two hours of the calls completion and will remain available via phone and Internet playback for one week. This webcast will also be archived on our IR website.  Participating in todays call are Jerry Fishman, President and CEO, and Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part of the call Jerry and Dave will present our second quarter results and our short-term outlook and then we will open it up for questions.   During todays call, we will refer to several non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for one-time items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in todays earnings release, which is now posted on the IR website. Weve also updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;Ls for continuing operations as well as historical quarterly and annual information for product revenue from continuing operations by end market and by product type.  Next, Id ask you to please note that the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which include risks and uncertainties. The companys actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in the companys SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this afternoon. The forward-looking information that is provided by the company in this call represents the companys outlook as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause the companys outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time sensitive information that maybe accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is May 19, 2009. With that, Ill turn the call over to Jerry for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us on today's call. As you can see from the press release we put out this afternoon and also our 10-Q, our Q2 revenues and profits were both well above the expectations that we communicated last quarter, as business levels stabilized and our cost reduction actions were more aggressive than originally thought in response to continuing economic uncertainty that still exists today. Revenues for our second quarter were approximately flat to Q1 levels and earnings per share increased sequentially by 17% excluding restructuring charges. On a sequential basis operating expenses, also excluding restructuring charges, declined by 8% sequentially and are now down 20%, or $48.0 million in total, over the past two quarters. Although the economic environment remains very challenging, we are encouraged by the continuing stability of our bookings activity over the past three months. We have also been given the very general sense from many of our customers that their incoming business levels have stabilized and their inventories have now reached satisfactory levels after two quarters of, in some cases, very significant declines. For the second quarter our revenues were $475.0 million, which was down 27% from the prior year and about flat to last quarter. In aggregate, our revenues grew sequentially in communications infrastructure and also in consumer products. However, our revenues continue to decline, albeit at a much reduced rate, in the industrial markets as capital spending worldwide remained depressed and our industrial customers have remained cautious. In line with these market trends, revenues increased sequentially in Asia and declined sequentially in Europe and North America, both of which are more dependent on industrial capital spending. Revenues for our very broad base of industrial customers, which were 52% of our revenues in Q2, were down 31% year-over-year and also down about 5% sequentially. Revenues from factory automation, instrumentation, and healthcare customers declined slightly from the prior quarter and while we don't expect much further erosion, we've not yet really seen any meaningful momentum in these markets. Not surprisingly, the automotive market remained troubled and our revenues from the automotive market were down 38% from the prior year, although we did see a small sequential increase as European automakers returned to production after numerous inventory reducing shut downs during the prior quarter. While automotive customers worldwide are plagued by very weak unit sales, their reliance on electronics to quickly bring differentiated features to the market continues to drive up vehicle signal processing content. So this bodes well for ADI when this industry does eventually regain some momentum. As was the case in the first quarter, in a few industrial markets, our revenue declines have been less severe. Revenues from defense customers were down only a small amount and products that sell into industrial infrastructure, such as security systems and energy management systemsand that's true particularly in Chinawere again much less affected than in the U.S. and in Europe. Despite the current weakness for our industrial customers we continue to be very enthusiastic about the mid- to long-term potential for ADI in the industrial markets for three important reasons. Number one, our sales to industrial customers over the past two quarters have declined at a significantly higher rate than industrial production has declined in the U.S. and Europe, which generally drives this business. Specifically, industrial production and output, which is often a very good leading indicator of industrial capital spending, declined approximately 9% over the last six months, while our sales to industrial customers from ADI declined 28% during the same period. This implies that we have absorbed the very significant inventory correction and that our sales to industrial customers have been well below their consumption rate of our products. Therefore, even if capital spending stays at depressed levels it would be logical to assume that our sales to industrial customers have reached, or will soon reach or approach, trough levels and will recover very quickly when capital spending begins to improve. Secondly, we have seen an increase in our industrial sales in China, in line with the government's industrial stimulus spending and that is likely to continue or perhaps even accelerate in the future. And lastly, our industrial customers buy our highest-performance converters and amplifiers as well as many ASSPs and our competitive position and our share continue to strengthen in many of these product categories. In fact, the most recent data that was published just recently in the last couple of weeks, I believe, by the Gartner Group, indicates that our converter market share increased to 40% in 2008, up from 37% the year before. We are also seeing very good design activity and good design wins across all the industrial markets we serve, which could accelerate our sales rebound when our customers' confidence improves in the United States and Europe. In the second quarter revenues from our communications customers were 29% of our revenues, down 7% from last year but up 8% to 10% sequentially. The recovery of the communications infrastructure market was driven in large part by China rewarding 3G licenses in January.  ADI is very well positioned across many customers, many standards, and of course many geographies, to take advantage of the upside from the China 3G roll outs as well as continued 2G expansion in emerging markets and upcoming 4G infrastructure build outs in the future. Design activity remains very strong with these customers as we expand the builder materials presence we have to a much broader section of products and that should continue to improve our long-term market share in this market as we emerge from the downturn. We also saw an increase in our wireless handset business in Q2, which has become right now a relatively small part of our overall communications business as we have now focused our investments primarily on analog products and higher-end phones. We believe the handset business, which was down significantly in the first quarter, most likely has adjusted production levels to be more in line now with end demand. Revenues from the consumer end market was 17% of our total revenues, down 36% from last year but up 5% sequentially, primarily due to increased sales of products like digital cameras, after very significant declines in our first quarter. Although the consumer market of course continues to be weak, here again the second quarter saw a modest increase in sales as many customers began to better align their production with end demand and stocked with a relentless declines in their inventories. Revenues from our computer customers, which comprised only 3% of our revenues, declined 44% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. As you might remember, we have mentioned previously that we have significantly reduced our investment in ASS products for computers, given what we see as a very limited opportunity for high-performance signal processing technology in the personal computer market. So now I will turn the call over to Dave, who is going to review in a little more detail on the financial results for Q2. David A. Zinsner I will start with gross margins. In Q2 gross margins were 55.1%, above plan for the quarter. Gross margins were down 590 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially, primarily a result of utilization rates of approximately 40% in our internal fabs as we further reduced inventories. As a result of lower utilization, inventories declined $16.0 million sequentially and days in inventory declined from 141 days to 130 days. These results were achieved despite a $7.0 million inventory build related to our ongoing fab consolidations and a further meaningful drop in distribution inventory.  Moving forward, we're still on track to complete our fab consolidations by the end of this fiscal year, which in aggregate should lead to an annualized decrease in cost of sales from current levels of approximately $65.0 million by the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We should begin to see the impact of these cost reductions in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 with the full savings benefits realized by the third quarter of fiscal 2010. In the second quarter operating expenses, excluding restructuring, were $192.0 million, down 8% from the prior quarter. In total, operating expenses were down $48.0 million, or 20%, from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Approximately 40%, or $20.0 million, of the $48.0 million drop is of a temporary nature. It is mainly related to a drop in variable compensation and forced time off. The remaining 60% of the savings are permanent reductions in labor and related expenses and reductions in discretionary expenses. Our goal is to retain a large portion of the saving in discretionary spending as revenues grow. We are also planning additional savings from actions already taken but for which the benefits have not yet been realized, as well as from future infrastructure cost reductions throughout the company. In Q2 operating income, excluding restructuring charges, increased 14% from the prior quarter to $70.0 million as operating expense management more than offset slightly lower gross margins on flat sales. Excluding restructuring charges, diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.21, up 17% from the prior quarter. Higher operating income and a better than planned tax rate of 18.8% drove higher net income. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash flow from operations was $76.0 million and capital expenditures were $12.0 million. Because our current level of internal capacity can support more than twice our current revenue level, we have significantly reduced capital spending plans for the year, down from $157.0 million last year to an expected $60.0 million in 2009, the bulk of which is tied to our fab consolidations. We believe that in future years our capital spending will be at similar levels to 2009. As a result, over time our annual depreciation, which was $144.0 million in fiscal 2008, should begin to move closer to our expected $60.0 million capital spending rate. Since most of our capital spending is manufacturing-related, this should be accretive to our gross margins. Accounts receivable decreased slightly from last quarter. DSO decreased to 44 days and 100% of our customers are current to terms. These are impressive results, particularly in the context of the current credit environment. During Q2 we paid out $58.0 million in dividends and this quarter our board once again approved a $0.20 per share quarterly cash dividend. At current prices, our dividend yield is approximately 4%. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and no debt. Although much of our cash is overseas, we continue to believe that our dividend is an important mechanism for returning value to our shareholders. We expect U.S. cash flow to increase when industrial revenues recover and as we realize the benefits of the Massachusetts fab consolidation. This consolidation should result in significantly increased U.S. profits and lower capital spending. Even during this difficult economic cycle, our business continues to generate strong cash flow, as it has done for many years. We believe that as economic conditions improve, demand recovers, and we fully realize the benefits of our fundamentally lower cost structure, our cash flow will significantly increase as will our earnings leverage. With that, I will turn the call back to Jerry. Jerald G. Fishman The orders to ADI and to our distributors recovered significantly in Q2 as customer inventory reductions abated. Our book-to-bill ratio for Q2, as measured by end customer bookings, was slightly above one for the first time since Q3 of 2008, and our Q3 opening backlog was up from last quarter.  In addition, order levels were stable throughout the second quarter and have remained at these levels through the first two weeks in May. Nevertheless, lead times are short and we are still receiving a significant portion of new orders as turns orders, which gives us, of course, very limited visibility. So given all these factors, were planning for our third quarter revenues to be approximately flat on a sequential basis. We plan to continue to reduce inventories in Q3, and keep very tight control over operating costs.  As a result, we expect gross margins to be in the 54% to 55% region and that will, of course, depend on the actual mix of business we ship and what ultimately we decide to be the appropriate factory utilization through the quarter. Overall, pricing for our products remains stable. We are planning for the operating expenses in Q2 to remain approximately flat sequentially and of course, to gain significant operating leverage when growth does resume. And as Dave mentioned, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% for the balance of the year.  As a result of all those things, we are planning for diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately $0.17 to $0.19 in Q3. So before we open up the call for questions, I just wanted to close with a few key points. Obviously in the last six months it's been a difficult environment in which to operate a company, particularly companies like semi-conductor companies that have large portion of the cost as fixed cost.  However, ADI's business model has allowed us to remain solidly profitable and continue to generate positive cash flow, despite the substantial short-term revenue declines that are the result of the economic chaos that's out there. Today our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry and are one of the very few companies that we compete with that has no net debt, as well as the opportunity for significant operating leverage as revenues increase. This leverage will be driven by our much richer product mix, which is the result of having refocused ADI on more profitable and sustainable products and markets over the past 18 months and a fundamentally lower expense structure, the result of actions that we have taken to permanently reduce our infrastructure costs. All these actions are designed to set us back on course towards our long-term model of 30% operating margins, which we now expect to achieve at lower revenue levels than we previously expected. Our strategic investment priorities within the company are now very well defined and our current portfolio and our competitive position are about the strongest they have been in many years.  Very importantly, our customers continue to view ADI as a technology leader, a reliable and trustworthy partner, and a financially stable supplier in a very chaotic environment. Our employees around the world understand where we are headed and despite all the pain of the last few quarters, I believe we are as committed as ever to ADI remaining one of the best technologies companies around. And I think all of that bodes very well for earnings growth and improved shareholder returns as the economy recovers. Mindy Kohl During today's Q&amp;A period we ask you to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up question and we will do our best to give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining.   Question-and-Answer Session  Operator  Your first question comes from Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities Just a question on the inventory commentary, you mentioned that you expect to bring down your own inventory in the next quarter. You did see inventory drop substantially. What are your plans in that and what should we imply about your utilization going into the next quarter? Jerald G. Fishman I think in general, it's always hard to say what the distis are going to do with their inventory in advance, but I think our utilization is going to probably be very similar to what it was this quarter. We still have pretty healthy inventories and we are going to try to get them down to give us the maximum upside leverage when business gets better. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities On the opex side of things, how long should we think about you being able to keep the opex at roughly under $200.0 million or if you wanted to add that $20.0 million that was temporary to the number, how should we think about opex growing versus revenues? David A. Zinsner First, I think it's important to note that that 20% that is temporary, a lot of that is highly contingent on actually profits increasing, so there is a sustainability to it that is pretty good if the business doesn't improve. Having said that, our goal is really, as we look at different revenue levels, take for example $550.0 million in revenue, as we get to that level, the last time we were at that revenue level our operating margins were kind of in the 20% range. Our goal is to get meaningfully about that and that's kind of how we're looking at opex. So opex, to some extent, is dependent on kind of timing and where we are making our investments and where the revenue is being generated, but I think it's safe to assume that our goal is really to expand operating margins, much beyond where we were the last time revenue was going up. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities The $48.0 million you said you cut in opex, was the percent, 20% of that was temporary or was $20.0 million out of the $48.0 million? David A. Zinsner About 40% of the $48.0 million was temporary. I think I said 20%, I meant 40%. And that roughly equates to the $20.0 million of temporary. But most of it is variable comp, which is highly dependent on how our operating margins do over time. Jerald G. Fishman I think there is very little doubt that any increase to opex is going to be very carefully controlled, no matter what happens on the upside. And we are certainly going to grow the revenues at quite a bit above any increase in opex. As we said earlier, I think in Dave's comments, we still haven't even really realized all the savings for actions we've already taken. As they come in over the next couple of quarters, on both the opex line and the cost of goods line. So, I think we have a lot of downward cost pressure in the company and the main reason is we expect to get to higher margins at lower revenues than we did last time and that's sort of the mantra around the company. Operator Your next question comes from John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company. John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company Jerry, you went through a bunch of details of the industrial end market and basically highlighting the fact that your sales in the end market have contracted much more than the actual industrial market itself. You then kind of went on to say that they are getting near trough inventories. And then you went on to say that you are poised to really bounce back when industrial spending comes back. If I'm not misinterpreting your statements, you are chipping into the industrial market at a fair rate below what they are truly consuming at today, even without a bounce back in spending. And if that assertion is correct, doesn't that mean that your sales could bounce back even before true industrial spending starts to recover? Jerald G. Fishman It's always hard to be precise when you are talking about a business with tens of thousands of customers in every geography. I think what I was trying to communicate is while that's possible, if you want to be pessimistic about the world, which we all tend to be right now, or cautious, we are saying that at least the rate of decline certainly abated last quarter.  I believe we are reaching the trough in these businesses, given the disconnect between what's happened in the markets and what's happened with our sales and all our competitors' sales in the industrial market. So there's not a lot more downside, I think, and for a lot of reasons, including the ones that you mentioned, there might be some upside, but it's too early to be optimistic about that. At least in the very short term. You know, we would like to see a real fundamental change in the momentum in the market before we really declare that that's going to get better. And you know, there are machinations going on about inventory going up and inventory going down but eventually there is going to be demand getting better and that's the time when you'll really see that business getting better. So my comments, in the summary, on the industrial market were more about given the fact that the inventories are ahead of what's going on in the market, it's at least unlikely that it's not going to go down anymore and maybe with the margin there will be a little bounce or something because of the abatement of the inventory reductions. But it's hard to tell. John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company Comm infrastructure and market, what are your thoughts on that as you look out over the next several months and quarters and obviously it's starting to bounce back. Do you think that can continue consistently or how do you view that? Jerald G. Fishman Your question is about the communications infrastructure? John Barton - Cowen &amp; Company That's correct. Jerald G. Fishman Well, clearly, it's been explosive in China. That's been well described by us and I believe many of our competitors and other people that participate in that market. You know, there are concerns out in the market that there is going to be a pause in China while they absorb all the stuff, but it's hard to predict that far in advance. I think in the long term in China there is going to be a huge build out that's going to continue. Whether there is a pause in that market in the short term, for a quarter, or maybe a little bit longer, it's very hard to predict. I think the infrastructure part of the market, outside of China, is probably more predictable than in China right now. And if you look at the large infrastructure providers in Europe and the United States, they are still blessed and headed pretty well. So the uncertainty over the next quarter or two is probably in the Chinese infrastructure market and there's a lot of different opinions of what might happen there in the short term. But I would say very few different opinions of what's going to happen in that market over the longer term. Operator Your next question comes from Steven Smigie - Raymond James. Steven Smigie - Raymond James I was wondering if you could comment a little on how much inventory you're thinking about taking out of the channel and internally here and what gross margin might have looked like if you weren't taking that out? David A. Zinsner Our goal really is to get our inventory down to in the 110 days on our balance sheet. As we look at inventory, you never know, but it's pretty close to where I would consider historical levels have been. Maybe it comes down a little bit more but not much more. It's tough to say on utilization. Obviously when we were a relatively utilized business model we were running at 61% gross margins, we got a couple of things going in our favor now coming into the next cycle. Our Limerick consolidation is now pretty much complete and we will start seeing the savings at the beginning of next year. We have the Cambridge consolidation going on right now. That will be complete by the end of this fiscal year and we're expecting to see savings middle of next year. So there's at least a couple of hundred basis points of improvement from those consolidations and as the revenue starts to pick back up we will start to see gross margin expansion, just from the absorption side of things. So our goal is really to see if we were at 61% back at the last peak, that if we get up to those revenue levels at some point, that we're at least a couple of hundred basis points about that. Steven Smigie - Raymond James That was definitely a question I was looking for an answer to but I also mean specifically in this quarter, if you weren't doing inventory reductions this quarter. David A. Zinsner It's difficult to say. I couldn't even ballpark it. Jerald G. Fishman I think it's probably fair to say that the lion's share of the declines that we have seen in the gross margin from the peak are about utilizations. So I mean there's nothing else going on with the mix that's very substantial. If anything, the industrial mix is down quite a bit, which is really whacked the utilization hardest and throws the most of the products from builders so, I think the real take away is that there is a lot of gross margin leverage in the system here and we are not planning yet in Q3 to turn out production because we're trying to work inventory down a bit. We'll have to take another look at that at the end of third quarter, decide what we do, and fourth quarter and for the balance of the year. And that will really determine, in the short term, what happens with gross margins. Steven Smigie - Raymond James And following up, drawing a conclusion from your comments there about what gross margin looks like several quarters out, I know you mentioned you were looking to hit that 30% operating margin on lower revenues, but presumably that operating margin will be quite a bit above 30%, as a few years out also, so basically is there some time maybe in the next quarter or two where you would come out with a new operating model? Jerald G. Fishman I would say once the business starts considerably moving up and there is real demand behind that as compared to supply issues, which are mostly driving the cycle right now, I think we are working on that very hard, we have a lot of ideas on what that is and how to get there clearly. Some of the actions we have taken are behind that new model. But I think it's a little premature to communicate a new model when we're running below 15% and the goal is 30%. As we start marching towards that goal, we will have a lot of updates on a different model above that. But I think for now I would try to keep the focus on let's keep moving it up, let's build in a lot of leverage as the sales grow, let's keep raising that every quarter in terms of the margins, as business gets better, and then we'll take a look at what the long-term model is as we start moving towards that objective. Operator Your next question comes from Uche Orji UBS. Uche Orji UBS Jerry, can I just ask you about some clarification as to one of the things you said in your closing remarks. You talked about the revenue level you need to achieve your 30% target model being less now than what you had expected. Are you able to give us some idea as to what those numbers are in terms of what expectation was before and what it is now? Jerald G. Fishman I'm not going to try to provide specificity on that right now. We're too far away from it. But I would say generically we got up to 25% or 26% at 650, which was the peak quarter. I guess that was Q4 of last year, and that we think we can do a lot better than that at lower revenue levels but I think it's premature to pick a revenue level and say at that revenue level we'll have this margin. I think we would like another quarter or so to see how the business unfolds and then we will give you a little more guidance on that in the future. Uche Orji UBS If I look at the guidance you've given to next quarter, do you mean that the end revenue mix should be similar to the quarter just ended, and if not, where do you think is and based on what you've seen so far should we expect to see the most surprise on the upside or the downside? Jerald G. Fishman That revenue target that we put out about flat, there's obviously pluses and minuses to that that are possible. It's very hard to be precise when most of it is turns business and the market is very volatile right now. So what we really communicated was the plan we're going to run the company at. I think it's important to say that that the expense levels and the way we're going to run the factories is going to be somewhat independent of what the revenue levels are for the next quarter.  So I think as we generically think about the whole question of the expense levels and the revenue levels associated with that, it seems to me the upside is probably that the inventory declines in the industrial business might continue to abate and that might give us a little more upside. We're expecting the consumer market to be a little bit better than it was seasonally because that typically is what happens.  On the risk side, we have the month of July, which is a great unknown and nobody can really predict what's going to happen in July. In typical years July is usually a weak month but lately there is no typical year because there are so many different things going on. And of course, there is risk in the infrastructure part of the business in China. So when we look at the pluses and minuses, our product groups, when they looked at all the details of that, came up with a number plus or minus a little bit that it's roughly flat. But how it actually turns out, I think we'll have to wait until the end of the third quarter to see. Uche Orji UBS Jerry, can you just tell us now about what your priorities are beyond taking inventory down and taking cost on the product side. Are there areas where you think that you need some more specificity on management and maps, [inaudible]. Jerald G. Fishman I'm not sure I understood your question. Did you ask what our strategic priorities are for the MEMS and the power business? Uche Orji UBS Yes. Jerald G. Fishman I think as we said before, they have both been strategic priorities for the company, each for different reasons. On the power side we have said that because it really is the one category in the analog business that we haven't had much sales and our customers really want us to be, as they continue to contract the amount of vendors, they want to do business and we've put a lot of money into that business. And as I mentioned, I think last quarter, despite all the economic chaos, it looks like we're really beginning to get some traction on some products and some customers in that business. It's been a long haul but we are. The MEMS business is a little bit different. The real strategic rationale for that business is that of course there's a lot of customers that have a lot of applications in MEMS. Increasingly that requires signal processing so it's a great addendum to things we already do.  But another important rationale to that is that it's hard to do and not many people can do it. It takes 15 years to figure out how to do it and it really does give us a real technology that it's not likely that we're going to have a lot of competition in, particularly amongst our traditional competitors. So it really, in a lot of applications, particularly automotive applications, but increasingly in industrial and other applications. I mean, it's just a tremendous building enthusiasm for things that can sense motion.  And it started out with accelerometers for cars, it's now moving into gyroscopes for cars and many other applications and behind every electronic stability control system, which is mandated pretty soon, there are going to be gyroscopes. And they are hard to do, believe me. It's taken us years to figure out how to do it.  So I think it's a compelling technology, we believe it's hard to replicate, we believe it goes hand in hand with many other technologies that we have in the company, be they analog or DSP light technologies. And the customersthis is one of the businesses where the customers really drag us into it because it really does change the end product if you can figure out to reliably and cost-effectively sense motion. In many different dimensions. So that's the rationale for each of those businesses. I think they both remain strategic priorities in the company and we're working to get more revenues and less cost, as we always are, like in every business, but they are important priorities for us. Operator Your next question comes from Jim Covello Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs First question, within the consumer segment, I think you commented the digital still camera was strong. Could you talk about the trends in the other two key segments within the consumer? I think that's digital TV and gaming. Jerald G. Fishman The digital TV market took a little pause out there, a large pause. That's been a very weak market over the last two quarters. Our internal forecasts indicate that that's going to get a little better this quarter. Time will tell if that really comes true.  The AV market has also been extremely weak. If we believe the forecast we're getting from some of those customers, at least on a seasonal basis, they're expecting some recovery. So we'll have to wait and see how that happens. Typically about third quarter we begin to see the build-up of that business and if this year turns out to be like other years, we should see some increase in that business next quarter.  But I think it would be very premature to say that the consumer market has turned and everything is going to go great. I think until the unemployment rate starts to abate we're not going to see big bulges in consumer spending. Or at least that's the theory under which we're running our company. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Relative to the turns business that you're assuming this quarter versus historically that you normally see in this quarter, about the same, little more conservative? David A. Zinsner It's relatively similar to historical levels. Last quarter obviously we did better and we had higher turns than we historically have, but the turns that we're building into our guidance this time around are pretty close to what the historical levels are. Jerald G. Fishman It's basically all turns. Nobody wants to hold inventory, nobody wants to give you any lead time. So I think that's the way the environment is going to stay for a while, at least for companies like ours. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Do you consider the ISM index a decent proxy for your overall industrial business? I know there's a lot of components to it but do you think that's a fair way to think about it? Jerald G. Fishman Yes, I would say that there are certainly trends that, with some lag or lead, tend to line up. And we look at that very closely and we have been encouraged by what we've seen over the last month or so, so time will tell. I think there's no doubt there's a correlation between those two, the question is the lag of that correlation to our business. But certainly when you see that starting to move up, that can't be viewed as a bad sign. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse David, I think that despite the inventory draw down in the April quarter there were still $7.0 million of buffer inventory you built for the upcoming fab closure. Is that something that will reoccur this quarter and how much excess inventory, or buffer inventory, should we think about relative to the fab consolidation? David A. Zinsner It is something for Cambridge that is likely to be repeated all the way up until we close Cambridge, which is at the end of the year. It's probably adding about 10 days to our inventory, the buffer builds. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse And Jerry, help me understand the upside in the April quarter relative to the down 10% mid-point guidance. What really drove that? Was it industrial mopping as that as you had first feared, was it the communications being stronger than expected? Just help me understand within the April quarter what drove the better than expected results in the top line. Jerald G. Fishman I think the answer to that is yes. The industrial business was a real collision course with Earth when we reported the numbers and we had really no understanding of where that was headed. The infrastructure business did a little bit better than we would have thought. Even the consumer business did a little better than we feared, I would say. So I think just generally, the amount of inventory that customers were getting rid of just abated at a faster rate than we feared and that gave us some upside. You know the 27% down year-over-year is not a great quarter, it just isn't as bad as we feared, which is really the way to think about it. And I think it was in those areas where we did a little bit better. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse The power management market, given that is a much more fragmented market than the converter market, can you help me understand the margin profile you are targeting in that market. And you mad the comment that your customers are pulling you into that business. What do they see that you have that they can't get elsewhere? Jerald G. Fishman In some of the more commodity power management areas where it's just really providing the function and five different people can do it and so on. We have gravitated a large part of the R&amp;D away from that part of the power business, but we see tremendous opportunity in others in the commodity part of the power business, in industrial products, in infrastructure products, and even in some of the consumer products where we can really do things in terms of integrating power with signal processing that is very hard for other, more power management-centric companies. So the very fragmentation that you mentioned of the power business is what gives us a good chance to actually get some meaningful revenues and make attractive margins in that business. I think if we stay out of the commodity parts of the power management business and focus on the areas that I mentioned, I don't think there is much of a difference in the gross margins we can achieve for other products that we sell into those particular markets. Operator Your next question comes from Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan. Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan Just a quick clarification. If you look at end markets within the flat guidance it sounds like you think that [inaudible] PC end markets will be up and the communication and industrial end markets will be down. Is that what we should imply? Jerald G. Fishman They are verythere is a fragmented answer to that question. I think there are some elements of each of those markets that you are saying will be down that really we are not planning for them to be down. There's part of the communications market whichthe Chinese infrastructure marketthat we will have to see how that goes. The rest of the infrastructure market I think remains pretty strong, as we see it. Many of the other communications applications, some of the networking stuff, some of the optical stuff, maybe even the handset stuff, might actually turn out to be a little bit better next quarter. We expect the consumer market to be a little bit better. One of the major concerns is just what happens in the month of July overall. If we wind up with a July like our December, when people shut down and nobody did anything and everyone went to [inaudible] for the month, then I think there are some risks to that. If July turns out to be a reasonable month, and there are no disasters, I think the estimate is probably in the mid-range of what's probably going to happen. Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan In terms of our thoughts on just inventory versus demand out there, it sounds like you're thinking that the channel is going to reduce inventory again in your end markets and maybe it's wait until next quarter where your business starts tracking in demand, is that a correct statement? Jerald G. Fishman What the channel does with our inventory doesn't affect our sales very much. It more affects our production levels. So we really don't know the answer to your question, so I mean, we get orders every week from the distributors, they get orders every week from the customers, we watch it very closely to see if there are any trends. You know, the distributor inventory is down quite a bit over the last two quarters. So on the other hand the turns are about flat because their sales are way down. So when the turns are about flat it's hard to predict which way they're going to apply pressure on this thing. If they believe the market is going to get stronger the end of the year and they're worried about shortages in the foundries and the like, I think they'll start to add inventory. If it turns out hopefully that they won't. I think that they could probably give you a better picture of what they're going to do with their inventories because we sure don't know. Christopher Danely - J.P. Morgan I was thinking more on your end customers or direct customers. And any words of wisdom for us on what you think their inventory trends are? Are they done working it down? Jerald G. Fishman I guess we hear different stories from different customers but I think generallyI mean, inventories came down pretty far so what it really has to do is, are they really optimistic or pessimistic about the future. In other words, there are some customers that basically keep singing the blues and I think those customers will continue to bang the inventories down. And there are many other customers that actually now are getting concerned about their inventory levels. They are very low. There's all the reports coming out of Taiwan about foundry capacity and so on. And they're getting a little nervous that they pushed this pretty hard. It's very interesting that this cycle, it's true that the reaction of customers to demand changes is about the most extreme we've ever seen, so customers this time were not going to make the mistake they made in 2001 and they reacted enormously quickly and severely to the changing outlook for their business. The good news is that got a lot of inventory out the cycle quickly and that's why I think when the demand, or the sentiment out there about the economy and what's going to happen, gets better, I think the snap-back will be good. But it's very hard to predict on as wide a customer base what the average customer is going to do. I think we have customers in both camps. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Dave, you mentioned the growing delta between your capex and depreciation. When do we start to see depreciation falling meaningful? Is that the middle of next year after the two fabs are shut down or is it later than that? David A. Zinsner Well, actually, depreciation will have a pretty decent fall, I think, next quarter but you really won't see that savings to the P&amp;L because most of that gets kind of hung on the balance sheet until the first quarter of next year.  So there will be kind of a step function decline in the next couple of quarters but then after that our best estimation is that it's going to kind of trail downward over the next five years or so because that's generally what we put the capital on the balance sheet at. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company And then more of a revenue question for Jerry. Jerry, you talked about, on this call and prior calls, the growth in the industrials business in China. Can you help us understand how big that business is relative to our overall industrials business, and how should we think about the growth characteristics of that business versus the broader industrials over the next couple of years? Jerald G. Fishman I don't have the exact numbers in front of us, we are going to have to dig those out for you, but I would say generally it's not surprising there's a huge industrialization. That's been going in China. Our sense when we talk to these large industrial customers over there, is that the government is really pumping an awful lot of money into new factories, for obvious reasons.  Now, eventually those factories have to produce stuff that sells, at the beginning in China but ultimately they have got to export stuff to justify all that and they're making a bet that when the economy starts turning in other locations that the exports out of China are going to go up very dramatically. So I think initially, mostly, it's to support Chinese consumption but eventually it's going to wind up supporting American and European and Japanese and other consumption. So I don't have any doubt that we've put in a tremendous amount of focus to building our industrial and other businesses in China because we really believe it's going to be like the United States as 40 or 50 years ago, where there was the industrial revolution here. And that business was an enormously fast growing business. So we have put in a fair amount of infrastructure into China. You know, the early signs are that our brand in China, which is a very good leading indicator of our industrial sales across many, many companies, is very strong in China. We have a great team over there and we have good leadership there. We have a lot of good engineers over there that actually design some of the products and we have good sales people and applications people over there.  So I think China is not only going to be the home of some of the very high volume commoditized products, but it's also going to provide a great opportunity for those that get in early into the base of what will turn out to be tens of thousands of industrial customers in China. It's not going to be any different than the United States in that way and Europe. It's just going to be about 40 years, 50 years later than in the U.S. So that's an important business lesson. I think if you want us to try to quantify that any more we would have to dig into the data, which I don't happen to have in front of me, but I would say, on a absolute basis, it's not a very significant part of our industrial business but certainly the percentage of our industrial business as it is has been climbing as that business has been growing and the rest of it leapt the track. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Jerry, you mentioned the converter market share data. As we've gone through the downturn, have you noticed any change in competitive dynamics in your core converter and amplifier businesses? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think everybody wants it. That's not a big change in this part of the cycle. So I think there's competition out there. There's always competition, always has been competition. So our job is just to continue the rate of innovation. We have a very dominant brand with the largest consumers of converter products and we have done a pretty job at Analog of doing that, despite all the competition over the last couple of years. So our job is to make sure we don't take our eyes off that ball since that is, those are, one of the most important things we do in analog. So, so far so good. We keep enormous pressure on making sure our technology is really strong, the customers know it, the sales guys sell it and I think there are a lot of people who find it hard to believe that in a market that size with all the competition we have been able to do as well as we have over the past five years in that business. So we are trying hard not to get complacent about that but it is an important of the R&amp;D that we put into the company and it's a very important part of our competitive advantage. Operator Your next question comes from David Wu - Global Crown Capital. David Wu - Global Crown Capital Dave, maybe you could help me with this. Once you consolidated two fabs in the first quarter fiscal 2010 how much does your manufacturing cost decline? Do you get it all at once or do you have it spread over two consecutive quarters and won't get the full amount until Q2? David A. Zinsner Actually, we don't get the full amount until the third quarter but the reason is more to do with how the inventory gets digested, so we have actually completed the Limerick consolidation for the most part so from a cash flow basis we are already seeing the savings but that inventory has to get digested through the system and that won't happen until the first quarter of 2010. So that's roughly about $6.0 a quarter, or $24.0 million or $25.0 million a year on an annualized basis.  Then the Cambridge consolidation with Wilmington happens at the end of this year and we'll start seeing the cash flow benefit of that at the beginning of next year, however, because we will build some inventory obviously on that and that has to get digested, our expectation is that will happen in the first two quarters of fiscal 2010 and so the new inventory at new cost, excluding these expenses associated with Cambridge, will start to be realized through the P&amp;L in the third quarter of 2010. That's roughly about $10.0 million a quarter, or about $40.0 million on an annualized basis.  So by the third quarter of 2010 the expectation is that we're at the $65.0 million of annualized savings run rate. David Wu - Global Crown Capital The $6.0 million would be achieved by what, the second quarter? David A. Zinsner The first quarter of 2010. David Wu - Global Crown Capital So $6.0 million and then $16.0 million by the third quarter. David A. Zinsner Right. David Wu - Global Crown Capital The second question I have is regarding this utilization rate. Once you consolidate your two fabs, does it automatically move higher? From the 40% rate that you have currently. David A. Zinsner Yes, we have more capacity than we need. We're eliminating some of that capacity so the utilization rate does improve. David Wu - Global Crown Capital Would it jump 10 or 15 points? David A. Zinsner I think it is about 10 points that it jumps. Operator Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech Can you spend a little bit of time talking about this cycle and what you are expecting to see from an ASP trend standpoint? Are there any early signs of aggressive behavior from your competitors? Jerald G. Fishman There are always competitors that are a little erratic on the pricing. We have live with that for many years but it is interesting when you look at ADI, our average selling price, which is made up of many different customers, many markets, many products, and many geographies, and many currencies, our average selling price hasn't moved very much. So there is always competitive pressure. We have good competitors, some of them are very aggressive on price, but overall, our average selling price has been reasonably flat for quite a while. On a particular product, the average selling prices typically go down as the products get older and then the ones that get really old go back up. In the analog business, that's just the way it happens when some of those products have 20-year life cycles.  But there are incidences where we have competition and they quote a lower price and sometimes we react to it and sometimes we don't. And sometimes we have a better product that we can sell them at a lower price than the old product we sold them. That's just the nature of this business. But I don't see any alarming trends that are significantly reducing our average selling price in anyplace really in the market. We always have aggressive competitors. There are some that think we are an aggressive competitor to other people's business that's out there, so it really depends on where you sit and what product areas you're in. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Amtech Do you think you could compare your July quarter guidance to your April quarter guidance and what level of tier you're pricing into your guidance, because clearly you said you were very concerned entering the present quarter that you just put up and you're still sort of echoing a level of concern. Can you calibrate us on how that's changed? Jerald G. Fishman I think it's a little bit less concerned than last quarter. Last quarter when we put the guidance out, you know, when you have a downward spiral it's always hard to predict the rate of that spiral whether it's going to abate or accelerate. I think the thing that's been encouraging, to a bunch of pessimists like us, are that the weekly order rates have been remarkably consistent for about three months now and when the rates are consistent you are not seeing rates that are 40% or 50% different every week, it gives you a little more confidence that there's a broad customer base out there that has sort of calibrated their worlds at a certain level. So I think there's always ups and downs in that but certainly the stability in the business we've seen gives us a little more confidence than when you're in a downward spiral. I think having said that, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there and we could have put out a large range and said it might be down some, might be up some and everybody would have put a flat number there anyhow, so we just sort of said that's about the plan for the quarter, that as you said, there is still uncertainty out there. I wouldn't in any way say that plan is a slam dunk. I don't think it's a sandbag plan. On the other hand, at least if I listen to our sales guys and our product guys, I don't think any of them are contending that there's a disaster out there. But plus or minus a few percent it's always very hard to call. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Whalen Citigroup. Terence Whalen Citigroup With regard to gross margin, given that we are taking about 300 basis points plus out of the gross margin from the COGS reductions of the Limerick and Massachusetts fabs, and also based on lower depreciation, Dave, looking out several years, assuming you get back to a $2.5 billion annual run rate, would the gross margin level be somewhere above 65% then? David A. Zinsner It's tough to call based on mix. What we know is that the last time we were at the 650 level we were at 61% gross margins. We feel pretty confident that we can do better than that. The question is how much I think is really dependent on mix. We have got obviously the depreciation going in our favor, some of which is coming from the consolidations, but some of it is coming from lower capital spending. We also have the consolidations, which takes out fixed costs outside of depreciation.  So we feel like we have got a lot of momentum going in our favor for gross margins. Mix will ultimately play a factor in that and our belief is that we can get well above 61%. I don't know exactly what level we will ultimately end at. Jerald G. Fishman I think the way to think about is, again, we're running 55, so let's calibrate the world on that. And we have put in a lot of programs to fundamentally reduce the cost of goods sold for analog devices, and most of those are these fab consolidations, there's other things that we've done to fundamentally reduce the cost structure.  I think that as we get closer and we start seeing sequential increases in the gross margin line rather than sequential decreases, as we've seen, I think we can be a lot more thoughtful and accurate about what actual gross margin we can achieve.  I think what we're really trying to do and what we have been trying to do, is start putting up quarters when business gets better where the gross margins go up, the opex ratio goes down and we've got a lot of leverage on the sales as they increase. I think trying to pin down the specifics of that when we're at 55% gross margin and 15% operating profit is very hard to do. So I think each quarter as we get more confidenceall we can really do is tell you the things we've done and what we think the cost savings are as a result of that. Those are things that are under our control that we know. The rest of it, we'll just have to wait and see how it goes. And what we're trying to build is a model tier with extremely high leverage. That's the take away. Terence Whalen Citigroup Regarding the monthly order linearity in the July quarter. It sounds like you're staying with a little bit higher backlog for the July quarter than you had started for the April quarter. And implied in that maybe is a little bit of tapering in the month of July orders. What are the swing factors that will determine whether July does taper off and might be expected for a flat number, or what would be the potential source of upside in your view, based on what you see now, potentially in July? Would it be coming from better comps, infrastructure? Would it be coming from some aseasonal industrial pickup or would it be the consumer and computing businesses? Jerald G. Fishman The third quarter will really depend more I think than any major trends in any of the segments, which I think are relatively small relative to our sales, will depend on just how customers feel about the world. If we get out to July and everybody is still thinking the world is coming unglued and the like, I think July could turn out to be a bad month and we will be on the long side of this. I think if it turns out that as we get out to July and people are believing that the end of the year is going to be good, that there is reason for the economies to believe that they are going to get a little bit better, and customers a little less afraid, credit eases up and you don't keep hearing about 600,000 jobs a month being lost in the U.S. and so on, and people get a little more confident, I think we could get better than typical seasonality in July. Because I think people are concerned about how low the inventories are. So I think we're not going to know that until July and I think that most of it, at least my view, other than some small ups and downs between one market segment or another, I think it will be mostly dependent upon sentiment out there. And that's the thing that's so hard to predict. Operator Your final question comes from Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML. Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML Dave, in terms of the reduction in infrastructure expenses or the plan to reduce those expenses, can you tell us what the extent of the benefit from that will be and how it will flow through in coming quarters? David A. Zinsner Some of which we have actually taken action on and you are seeing the savings in the drop we've gotten to today at the $192.0 million level. There is some benefit coming in the next few quarters. It's of the few million dollars per quarter kind of range, from we have talked about to date. We are still lookingwe have an active process of looking at infrastructure expenses and identifying better and less expensive ways to go about delivering our infrastructure services to the company and over the next couple of quarters I think we will identify more opportunities but at this point we are unable to quantify it. Getting back to Jerry's comment at the very beginning, the opex is at $192.0 million and our goal is to really constrain that a lot while revenues are flat and if things return to growth, which we assume they will at some point, is to really constrain the growth on opex so that it is much slower than the growth on the revenue side, until we see a lot of leverage. Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML Given that you are reporting a month after a lot of other companies, is it clear to you that there is going to be a pause in the China 3G build out here in the July quarter. Is that how you're planning for business or are the lead times still short that you don't know for sure? Jerald G. Fishman We never know for sure. I think that we know sort of that we listened to a lot of our competitors who talked about that a little bit. When you talk to the large companies in China there is sort of differences of opinion of their views on what's going to happen this quarter. A lot of these products are very short delivery items so we don't really know, but I would say generically we are planning for a little bit of weakness on the Chinese side of the infrastructure market and not so much weakness on the European and U.S. side of the infrastructure market. But built into our assumptions is this, probably, certainly the rate of growth is going to pause for a while there and it's possible it could decline sequentially quarter-to-quarter. But I think the important take away for us on that business is it's not going to be a very long one. There is a tremendous build out that's still ahead of us and whenever you see a large increase in a business as we've seen, in the Chinese infrastructure business, it wouldn't be surprising to see a pause, although there's lots of different opinions about that. But the direct answer to your question is our assumptions are that is going to decline a little bit in the third quarter although not a tremendous amount. Sumit Dhanda - BAS-ML And that's an assumption or based on actual feedback? Jerald G. Fishman I think it's a combination of both.

Therefore, this conference call will include time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast which is November 23, 2009 With that Ill turn it over to our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald G. Fishman  Well, thanks, Mindy, and thanks to everybody for joining us on todays call. As you can see from the earnings announcement we put out earlier today, our fourth quarter was a very strong quarter for ADI. Our revenues increased by about 16% or about $80 million sequentially to $572 million, which was well ahead of the earlier forecast that we communicated to you last quarter. We experienced the strongest sequential growth in automotive and consumer products, but I think most importantly we also began to see very strong growth in our traditional industrial products, which grew 14% sequentially. Communications revenues declined very slightly as a result of inventory rebalancing at some of our largest infrastructure customers. PT revenues which are now a very diminumous part of our business also grew sequentially. Revenues grew sequentially in virtually every product category at ADI in our fourth quarter.  Year-over-year and the full year results by end market and product category, as Mindy mentioned earlier, are available on ADIs Investor Relations website for your review.  Importantly, our gross margins for the quarter increased by 220 basis points sequentially to 56.3%, which was also well ahead of our expectations. And thats despite a sales mix that favored lower margin automotive and consumer products. This increase was primarily due to higher sales and an increase in our industrial business, which provided slightly better factory utilization. Inventories declined to 92 days and are now at historically low levels. Despite much lower inventories, our service levels to our customers remains very good and our lead times continue to be very short for most of our products.  Our operating expenses increased approximately 3% or about $6 million sequentially, but were down over 19% from the same period last year, excluding one time items. The sequential increase in Q4 was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense, resulting from the 650 basis point sequential improvement in our operating margins in Q4. All other expenses during the quarter were essentially flat to Q3 levels.  As a result of very strong sequential sales gains, coupled with the 220 basis point improvement in gross margins and a 430 basis point improvement in operating expenses, operating margins expanded to 22.5% up from 16% last quarter. Interestingly, for each additional revenue dollar, we drove about approximately $0.62 to operating profit. This really demonstrates the very significant leverage that weve built into our model in the past year or two through manufacturing consolidations and corporate wide cost reductions, which is in line with the plan that we communicated to you over the last few quarters. In Q4 earnings per share grew to $0.36, which was up 64% sequentially from Q3. About $0.01 of that increase was the result of a year end tax adjustment. So overall, Q4 was a very successful quarter by most measures, as we executed on our important objective to emerge from this cycle a more focused and a more profitable company. So now Ill turn the mike over to Dave, whos going to review the financials in a bit more detail. David A. Zinsner  Thanks Jerry. As Jerry stated, revenues were $572 million, which was a 16% increase from the prior quarter and a 13% decrease from the prior year. Orders increased substantially again this quarter. We closed the fourth quarter with a book to bill that was well above one, resulting in higher backlog. Gross margins were 56.3%, which was more than 100 basis points higher than expectations. This was up from 54.1%, which we reported in the third quarter. As Jerry mentioned this was due to higher sales and an increase in our industrial business, which provided slightly better factory utilization.  Inventory on our balance sheet declined by $23 million or 8% this quarter and days of inventory fell to 92 days, which is a recent record for ADI.  We increased utilization slightly this quarter. However, demand from our OEM customers and distributors was even stronger, which was the primary driver of the reduction in inventory. Looking ahead to next quarter, were expecting utilization for our two internal fabs to increase again modestly to respond to the increased level of demand. Days of inventory will likely remain at a similar level to this quarter. Weve been able to maintain lead times in line with prior quarters, and feel comfortable that we can operate at these historically low levels of inventory. Distributor inventory increased slightly. However, days of inventory remained relatively flat, an indication that the channel continues to watch inventories closely. As we expected, third quarter 2009 gross margins appear to have represented a trough for this cycle. We believe that gross margins will continue to improve throughout the next several quarters, and expect that we will be above 60% by the end of fiscal 2010. There are several drivers to this gross margin improvement. First, were just beginning to realize the savings from our two fab consolidations, which will begin in earnest in fiscal Q1 and continue throughout the year. Second, we should experience a richer product mix in 2010 as a result of the reprioritization of our investments over the past few years. Third, we have had a significant focus on inventory levels during this cycle. And the result? Weve kept utilization low when sales declined. As our industrial business grows, were anticipating utilization will steadily improve, which would drive further gross margin improvement. And lastly, were expecting depreciation to gradually decline over the next several years as we keep capital spending at historically low levels, approximately 3% of sales, reflecting higher external wafer purchases, which require less capital spending at ADI.  For the fourth quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $16 million, and for the full year they were $56 million. This represented a 64% decline from fiscal 2008. Operating expenses were $193 million, up $6 million or 3% from the prior quarter, but down $46 million or 19% from fourth quarter of the prior year, including one time items. The increase quarter over quarter was almost entirely the result of increased variable compensation expense on a 63% improvement in operating income. We have seen solid results from our initiative to get more leverage from our operating expenses. In fact, the last time we were at similar revenue levels to Q4, which was approximately $575 million in revenue, our operating expenses were more than $75 million higher on an annualized basis. For the first quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately flat with the fourth quarter. In subsequent quarters, were planning modest sequential increases as revenues increase.  Other expenses were approximately $1 million as expected. At this point were not expecting a rise in short term rates, which would benefit our non-operating income, so we expect that other expenses will be approximately $1 million next quarter as well. Our annual tax rate was lower than the rate we anticipated at the end of our third quarter, so we trued up our tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which had the effect of increasing our EPS by $0.01 per share. Next year we expect our tax rate to be approximately 19% to 20%.  Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million this quarter and were expecting weighted average shares for next quarter of about 300 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.36, down 27% from $0.49 in the year ago period, but it was up 64% from $0.22 in the immediately prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $163 million or 29% of sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we had $16 million in capital expenditures, which resulted in free cash flow of $147 million or 26% of revenue. We also paid out $58 million this quarter in dividends. Total cash and investments at the end of fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, up $92 million from $1.7 billion last quarter due to continued strong cash flow from operations and low capital spending. Net cash after debt was approximately $1.4 billion. Our AR balance increased slightly due to the increase in shipments. However, our DSO stayed relatively flat at 48 days and we have no customers that are late to their payment terms. In summary, this was a very solid financial quarter for ADI. Our goal has been to drive more leverage in our model during this cycle and Q4 represented evidence that we are beginning to see the expected expansion of gross and operating margins. Now Ill turn the call over to Jerry to discuss key end market trends and our short term outlook. Jerald G. Fishman   Thanks Dave. Revenues from our very broad base of industrial customers, which are about 52% of our total revenues in Q4, were up 17% sequentially. And as you might remember, that category is inclusive of automotive and healthcare, both of which grew at very high sequential rates last quarter. External to the automotive and healthcare segments are our clients and industrial revenues which include process control, factory automation instrumentation, grew approximately 14% sequentially. Automotive sales were particularly strong, due in part to automotive stimulus programs, providing a boost to sales in North America and Europe, but also as a result of a much richer automotive product portfolio that were now selling at ADI. Revenues from automotive customers increased 37% sequentially in Q4, reaching levels close to their peak, which we experienced in the third quarter of 2008. In Q4, sales of our battery monitoring, brake sensing and automotive MEMs products, all increased significantly. And we had further design activity for our lithium ion battery monitoring solution for hybrid and for electric vehicle systems, with suppliers in North America and Europe and also in China. Revenues from our healthcare customers returned to growth this quarter, much as we had expected, and increased 17% on a sequential basis, although still quite a bit down from the fourth quarter of last year. Overall, designing activity and healthcare customers continues their very rapid pace and we believe we have the opportunity to grow our share in many important areas of this market, particularly in advance imaging systems, where our newest 128 channel, 24 bit converters enable four dimensional views of internal organs.  Based on the strength of both the OEM and distribution orders, which has continued into November, and the growth in our backlog, were expecting a further increase in industrial sales in the first quarter.  In the communications market, sales of optical, networking and wired infrastructure products all increased from the previous quarter. Wireless infrastructure products declined slightly as a result of delayed GSM deployments in developing regions, which resulted in inventory level adjustments by some of our customers. Deployments of the more advanced 3G systems, which enable high speed data services, remained strong in the developed regions as operators continue to upgrade their networks to capture the increased mobile data traffic and our sales to these 3G applications increased slightly in the quarter. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect continued modest sales growth from 3G system upgrades and for sales from GSM applications to remain flat to Q4 levels.  Looking forward, our customers expect contracts to be awarded in China for the next phase of 3G deployment in early 2010. And depending on the actual timing of these deployments, these should drive upside revenues in the out quarters. As weve mentioned previously, our market position in China is very, very strong and we expect that as those deployments get made they should positively impact our revenues. Revenues from consumer customers were about 25% of our revenues, up 38% sequentially with very strong sales in all major consumer applications. Q4 as you might remember is typically a very strong consumer quarter for ADI, as builds get done ahead of the holiday season. Consumer revenue has now returned to pre-downturn levels with sales increasing for the third consecutive quarter, albeit at a more significant rate in Q4. Contributing to our fourth quarter growth in consumer products were increasing sales of our analog front end products for cameras, HDMI related products and also MEMs based products as well. We expect consumer sales to be down in the first quarter as they typically are, as ordering typically slows following the Christmas build. Looking forward to 2010, we continue to very closely monitor our customer ordering patterns for clearer signals about the prospects for growth for the year. During the fourth quarter of 2009, order rates from end customers accelerated very significantly and grew by approximately 17% sequentially. And as a result, backlog for delivery in the next 90 days grew substantially. Our belief is that this atypically strong growth in Q4 was really the result of three things. First, overall many economies began to improve from the depressed levels of 2009. This is particularly noteworthy in our industrial business, which as I mentioned earlier includes factory automation, process control, and factory instrumentation and scientific instrumentation. In addition, the automotive stimulus programs no doubt provided a boost to sales to automotive customers.  Secondly, many customers have now moved out to an inventory accretion mode rather from an inventory depletion mode that theyve been in over the past year, as they now have become incrementally more positive about their businesses and have worked their inventories down to extremely low levels. Thirdly, ADI is benefiting for what appears to be a very rich new product cycle as a result of having made more focused investments over the past few years. So we expect that our industrial revenues will continue to grow sequentially in Q1 in line with higher manufacturing activity worldwide and our higher opening backlog. For the first quarter were expecting automotive and communication sales to be relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter. In addition, were planning for consumer sales to decline in Q1, given the large sequential revenue increases in Q4, some of which may not repeat in Q1. And also very typical seasonal patterns for lower consumer sales that we often see in Q1. So as a result, when we add up the growth were expecting in all the market segments, were planning for revenues in Q1 to be approximately flat to Q4 levels, and up 20% from the same period last year. Our current planning assumption for our 2010 plan is for revenues to increase throughout 2010 beginning in our second quarter.  Were planning for gross margin to [inaudible] again in Q1 as a result of lower infrastructure costs and a much richer mix of industrial sales. Our current plan is for gross margins to increase by an additional 150 to 200 basis points to 58% to 58.5%. We anticipate gross margins to continue to expand throughout 2010 for many of the reasons that Dave mentioned earlier. Were planning for operating expenses in Q1 to remain relatively flat to Q4 levels, in line with our plan to achieve very high operating leverage going forward. For the balance of this year were planning for only modest increases in operating expenses as revenues increase. Given this level of revenues and margin, and our expense plan, our plan is for diluted earnings from continuing operations in Q1 to be approximately $0.36 to $0.37, excluding restructuring charges that we plan to take in Q1 associated with the final closure of our fab in Cambridge. Were planning for continuing low capital expenditures for 2010 in the range of $60 to $70 million or 3% of sales with depreciation currently running at about 6% of sales. So in summary, overall were executing well on our plan to transform ADIs business model to produce good growth and higher margins. First we continue to realign our investments and our product portfolio to better focus on the most promising and the most sustainable opportunities where ADIs technology makes a fundamental difference to our customers. Just recently we announced a major reorganization of our design, marketing and selling resources, which we believe will better balance our product or technology centric structure that has made us so successful for decades, with a parallel market facing structure that will make it much easier for customers to gain access to the breadth of ADIs technology. This structure will provide much greater strategic clarity at ADI and I believe really help us focus our resources on the highest corporate priorities. Secondly, we have fundamentally reduced and we will continue to reduce ADIs infrastructure costs worldwide. As a result of these and other actions, we believe were very well positioned to deliver significant operating leverage as revenues increase, as I think we amply demonstrated in our Q4 when earnings increased over 60% on a 16% revenue increase. In just the past 12 months weve consolidated two complex wafer fabs, weve reduced inventory levels from 141 days to 92 days, and weve kept customer service levels high during the entire process.  Our continuing short lead times reduce the risk of double ordering from our customers and our distributors, and I believe provide competitive advantages relative to suppliers whose lead times have extended.  And finally, despite all the tremendous challenges during 2009, weve continued to invest for the future. This strategy produced a record crop of 300 new products in 2009. We expect many of these innovations to be strong growth drivers for ADI over the coming quarters, as these products help our customers solve extraordinarily difficult signal processing challenges. With Q4 new product sales amongst the highest levels in the history of ADI, many of these recently introduced innovative products have shown excellent revenue momentum right out of the gate. And we should continue to enjoy the benefits of these products in 2010 and beyond. As weve said many times in these calls, our long-term success will often be dependent on how we respond to downturns which occur routinely in our business. Last year we presented a strategy for navigating through the downturn which we believe would result in ADI emerging in an even stronger position than weve been in before the economy went into a tailspin. Over the past year by maintaining a relentless focus on innovation and executing our strategic priorities, including the aggressive streamlining of our cost structure, weve emerged in a very strong competitive position, perhaps the strongest position in our history.  During the past few years Analogs employees around the world have stepped up and embraced these challenges with a great sense of purpose and determination, which we believe will reward investors in the coming years.  Mindy Kohl Thank you Jerry. During todays Q&amp;A period please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow on question. Well give you another opportunity to ask additional questions as we have time remaining. Operator, were now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session  Operator   Your first question comes from John Pitzer - Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse I guess Jerry and David, when you talk about the order rates and the October quarter being up 17% sequentially and backlog growing, Im kind of wondering why just flat revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter. Is that typically a quarter where youre dependent upon less turns? Or are you just throwing in some tops down conservatism, just kind of given the volatility in the macro environment? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think certainly you know were always cautious during all these periods where you cant quite predict the ordering patterns and the revenue patterns as you normally can during a stable market. So you know we are running the company conservatively. Were setting the expense objective conservatively and the revenue objectives conservatively. Certainly we have the capacity to ship more than flat this quarter, even though our inventory levels have come down quite a bit we have very good coverage on inventory, very short lead times. So if it does turn out that the revenues turn out to be stronger, then well certainly be ready to do it, but we are trying to manage the company relatively conservatively, given all the uncertainty out there in the markets.  I mean typically our first quarter is a down sequential quarter mostly because the consumer market goes down and we get less days of sales for our industrial products, which tends to, you know, generally we were down a couple of percent to 5% in the first quarter. So I think with flat sales in Q1 thats going to be a better quarter than we typically have sequentially. And thats I think particularly true given the very large increase we had last quarter which you know any time where companies like ADI or any of our competitors puts up a, you know, a mid double digit sequential number you have to be a little cautious for the next quarter. And I think thats what were trying to do. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse  Dave, if my notes are right, I believe you talked about utilization rates being about 45% in the July quarter. They picked up here a little bit. I guess Im kind of curious, at what utilization level do you start to see lead times stretching out or I guess whats your ability to keep lead times from not stretching out, given the pick up in end demand? David A. Zinsner Well I think I said in the actual prepared statement that you know now were starting to rethink the model on inventory. And originally we thought we would operate in the 100 to 110 day range. Weve operated now in the 92 range for a quarter. Lead times have not moved out at all. Weve been able to service every customer out there. So I think were now operating in a different model for inventory whereas you know more in the kind of 90 to 100 days, which makes sense. Were becoming more of a hybrid between internal and external manufacturing. We have the ability to order wafers relatively quickly from our external foundry. So you know I think that were kind of comfortable at this point where the range is. Well pick up utilization again next quarter a little bit, just to catch up a little bit since we obviously brought down inventory quite a bit. But you know I dont imagine it going up too significantly until we start to see industrial continue to grow. John Pitzer - Credit Suisse  But, Dave, I guess, is there utilization level where lead times will stretch out and youll have to build inventory and customers will have to build inventory? Or is that no longer applicable just given the flex capacity? David A. Zinsner I think were at, you know, 50% utilization now, give or take. And we have plenty of head room to bring that utilization up. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, we can respond reasonably rapidly. You know the equipments installed, labor for it is leased on the engineering and management level is pretty well fully staffed. So if we decide to, we can ramp that production pretty quickly. Our plan right now is to ramp it slowly as long as we can keep the lead times down. And you know to the extent we sense that lead times are going to extend, we would ramp it more quickly and that wouldnt take us very long. But our sense is to try to keep inventories low and to keep the lead times low. And you know, so far weve been able to do that, even though we got surprised on the upside on the revenues by quite a bit this quarter, we really didnt run into any shortages of any consequence, and our production people feel pretty good about being able to respond pretty quickly to anything that comes our way in the next couple of quarters. Operator Your next question comes from Uche Orji UBS. Uche Orji - UBS Jerry, let me just follow up a little bit on the lead time comments. You know through this reporting season we havent really had many companies admit to having long lead times, its always people saying we dont have long lead times, but the market lead time is higher. Can you give us a sense of you know just in terms of your vantage view of the market, you know, where lead times really are? I know yours are short, but in terms of your ability to take market share as a consequence of long lead times in the industry, just help us quantify the way it [tends]. Jerald G. Fishman I think, you know, there are a group of competitors out there that I think have and typically do keep their lead times very short and they dont make [mets] of changes in their production levels. And I think we have other competitors that have really fallen behind on their ability to supply customers. So I think its really a mixed bag. And you know Ill leave it up to each of our competitors to say who they are. But it really is a mixed bag out there. You know for a while the foundries were struggling to keep up, but I think by and large you know the foundries have kept up, at least with our requests from them. And so I dont expect that theres huge shortages out there except from a few suppliers in a few markets but not across the board. So I cant speak for anyone elses lead times or for any one elses plans to keep them lower. I can just speak for Analogs and were going to keep them low. Uche Orji UBS  Well, just as a follow up, can you talk about within your product areas amplifiers, I mean its the only product [capacity] rate that did not grow double digits this quarter. Clearly underlying that does that mean the amplifier business thats restricting growth within that business? Jerald G. Fishman No. I think it turns out that when you have the most strength in the automotive business and the consumer business, a lot of those, you know, they have a lot of converters and amplifiers built into them, but theyre typically more integrated products where you know they go into the other category, the other Analog category. So I dont think theres any real information there. It just turns out that a large part of the strength or the most strength is in automotive and consumer products which arent as prevalent as stand alone converters and amplifiers as say the industrial business is. Uche Orji UBS  And just one last question on the communication and venture correction you mentioned, I know you expect to see some growth picking up next year in the communication infrastructure business. Can you just talk about where you think where would inventory correction [inaudible]?  Jerald G. Fishman Well I think its, you know, its lasted a couple of quarters and lasted a little bit longer than you know many of us would have believed. You know you might remember that prior to a couple of quarters ago, the year-over-year increases were staggering at the beginning of the, you know, downturn of the cycle. That was the only thing that was keeping most of us running. You know our sense is that theres another big TDS, CDMA deployment coming up in China. The tenders are out there and you know theres varying accounts of you know whether thatll be our first quarter or our second quarter or our third quarter. Its very, very hard to tell.  But I think it will happen this year and when it does happen, you know, well do quite well, as well as with 3G deployments in other locations around Europe and the United States. One of the big variables is, you know, we still sell stuff into the older GSM standards, mostly in the developing countries. And that tends to bounce around a little bit. So I mean this business has always been a up or down business and the only thing we can do is make sure that our share remains strong, which it is; that our content keeps increasing in each of those base stations which it has; and now the, you know, quarter-to-quarter thats going to be a lumpy business. Operator Your next question comes from James Covello - Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs  First question, where do you guys think we are relative to the inventory correction in the industrial segment in particular? In other words, do you think are you still under shipping your customer demand in the industrial segment or do you think weve caught up there now? Jerald G. Fishman Well thats very, very hard to be definitive on. You know we serve a lot of those customers through our distribution partners and you know the conversations weve had with the larger distributors more recently indicates that they dont think theres a lot of inventory building going on in the industrial customers. You know they think theyre resetting their inventory models. You know their guess is Q1 is going to be atypically strong as they sort of complete that. But what theyre most optimistic on is that these companies are thinking theyre really going to grow. And you know when you look around in the United States, its sort of hard to get enthusiastic about what you see going on in the industrial race in the United States and whats going on in many U.S. companies.  But if you look outside the U.S. and the large industrial customers we have in other locations, theyre doing pretty well and their business continues to grow. And increasingly a larger percentage of our business is now coming outside the U.S. and industrial customers as well as the large base we have inside the United States. So I mean its sort of hard to tell, but all we can do is repeat what were hearing from the distributors and our largest customers. And they tell us and they seem to be quite confident that theyre not building a lot of inventory, theyre just replenishing it and theyre, you know, probably at least partially if not mostly done with that. But the reason theyre buying product now is because theyre expecting next year to be better than this year. James Covello - Goldman Sachs  Dave, what do you think it would take for you to surpass your previous historical margin levels in this upcoming cycle? David A. Zinsner Well I think we are going to surpass the previous cycle. Weve got a number of things, tailwinds in our favor. One the two fab consolidations drive about $65 million of annualized savings. In the first quarter well start to see the first of the savings will probably be somewhere in the kind of $5 to $7 million for the first quarter. So thats going to be a good tailwind for us. Depreciation is also coming down. I mentioned that capital spending is now lower at the company given our kind of our, you know, half external, half internal kind of model, give or take. So thats also going to drive some good savings. I talked about the mix. I think Jerry talked about mix as well. We think industrial mix is going to improve over the course of next year. And so those things should all drive good margin improvement. We think well beat the previous peak, which was about 61%, and we feel pretty confident of that fact at the moment. Jerald G. Fishman And a lot of the things weve done on the OpEx side, which is the other really great driver of what margins we ultimately achieve, you know as we had mentioned some of those things creep back in very slowly, but a large part of those things are not going to creep in. And so were going to wind up as Dave mentioned at the same revenue levels that we had. Last time we had this revenue level we had fundamentally lower costs and I think the costs of the company are going to continue to remain under very, very tight control, given the margin leverage that were seeking. And I think also that were learning how to manage the business with less OpEx, and I think thats going to continue to go on. So I think for both of those reasons in terms of the gross margins and the OpEx line, you know we still think from here weve got plenty of leverage left. And when we get all that leverage, well be at higher margins than we were at comparable sales in the last cycle. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities Jerry, when you talked about the [disti] I believe going from depletion to accretion mode, usually that doesnt end well. Can you just talk to us about how far along that process they are and maybe give us kind of a historical context? Jerald G. Fishman I think theyre relatively past that process. I mean what really happened is, you know, the distributors and you know in fact all of the customers just stopped when the business went to hell, the credit markets, you know, didnt allow people to borrow to buy inventories and so on. And I think if you look at what theyve been doing, you know, theyve been trying to get back on the right number of days in the channel. You know Dave mentioned earlier that distributor inventory hasnt gone up at all in days. And I think that, you know, when you talk to the distributors, you know they basically are very, very tight on what theyre trying to do. You know for a quarter or so wed see the orders on us be ahead of the orders that the end customers would place on them. But increasingly over the last month or two, youd see those lines starting to converge. So I think theres been a catch up in trying to get their inventories up, but I think theyre being incredibly tight compared to what weve seen in previous cycles on their inventory management. And if you believe them and, you know, when you look them in the eye, I do believe them, that I dont think theyre going to go out there and just randomly buy inventory right now. I think the level of discipline everybody has, from the customers to distributors to even us, is much, much greater than its ever been. So you know theres always that risk that you mentioned and for those of us whove been around a long time weve all seen the phenomena you mention. But you know we watch our distributor turns very, very closely. We hit their inventories every single week and we look at them very closely. And were determined not to overstock our distributors. And its not really a battle right now because theyre not running ahead any more of what their customers are ordering from them, which is why the turns are staying about constant. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities  I guess just so we can quantify it a little bit, how does the days theyre carrying now, I know that theyre flat sequentially as you said, but how does that absolute days level compare to either where they were a year ago or some historical normal level? David A. Zinsner  Its a little bit lower than normal levels. You know I think were in a new environment where you know normal levels are a lot lower. Jerald G. Fishman Thats what we believe, that the divergence between those lines are converging and it might be that the distributors really want to run their businesses at lower levels, and theyre certainly talking like theyd rather do that. And I think thats a good idea. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities  I guess as a follow up question then switching to gross margin and the outlook for it to go up 150 to 200 basis points basically, can you just walk us through the metrics there? Because I would think with mix and utilization being positive, plus you get the first batch of the Limerick cost savings, I would think it could have been at least what you guided to if not potentially a little bit better. So if you could just help quantify those levers, please. David A. Zinsner Well, it can always be better obviously, but I think the way were thinking utilization probably adds another 75 basis points, the fab consolidation probably adds another 75 basis points and then mix, you know, is probably another 50 to 100 basis points. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah - Barclays Capital. Romit Shah - Barclays Capital It seems like you have the ability to drive gross margins into the mid-60% range, but if you look at companies that are in that range or higher, they dont seem to be growing as fast. And so my question is Jerry, do you think theres a correlation there? And if so, you know, how do you think about balancing revenue growth and margins at ADI? Jerald G. Fishman Well thats something you know we worry about and look at and think about very, very carefully as we do this thing. You know theres a lot of ways to get your gross margin up that are very negative to sales growth. You know you can go out and raise all your prices and see what happens, you know, play chicken with the customers. And that tends all the time to have a very deleterious effect on your revenue growth, both in the short term Id say and the long term. And the other thing you could do is you can get your costs down and increase your gross margins. And you know our fundamental strategy is more the latter than the former.  You know we have a higher average selling price for our products than many of our direct competitors and I think we have the opportunity to run much higher margins as a result of that. So you know Ive always said that were not turning away a lot of business at 60% gross margin to try and get the margins up by a point or something. You know any business that comes along thats credible, you know, were in. So I think its mostly a question for Analog of cost reduction rather than price increases and thats what were going to do. Thats what we have done over the last year or so and thats where the focus is going to be. And I think if you follow that leg of the stool, you dont lose business. In fact theres an opportunity to get even more business because you can be more price competitive.  So were not going to push Analog down the rat hole of, you know, lets take 75% of the revenue thats above some gross margin and give the rest of it away. I dont think thats a good long term strategy for any company and certainly not for Analog. You know we have businesses as you know where we never expected we could get a return on the R&amp;D investment, either at the gross margin or the operating margin level, and those businesses weve decreased investment in or gotten out of. But this isnt a relentless pushing Analog for gross margin at any sales revenue level, its to have better than industry average growth at increasing gross margins, and I think we can accomplish both of those things simultaneously by really focusing on the cost part of the equation. Romit Shah - Barclays Capital  Do you think 65% is a realistic gross margin target down the road? Jerald G. Fishman I think when we get to 60, well have this conversation again. But as Dave said, we have a lot of tailwinds and well see how it goes. I mean were putting up a lot of gross margin leverage, you know, the last quarter and were going to put up a bunch more this quarter. Were going to put more up by the balance of the year. Lets see how we do over the next couple of quarters and well put up a new model when we do. Operator Your next question comes from David Wu - GC Research Ltd. David Wu - GC Research Ltd. Just remind us, how big is the automotive business in the fourth quarter? Jerald G. Fishman In dollars or percentage? David Wu - GC Research Ltd.  Well, either way. David A. Zinsner Automotive is a little bit north of 10%. David Wu - GC Research Ltd.  And the other thing I was wondering is youve been watching the distributors improve their inventory turns but how do you monitor your OEMs and they go through their, do you have hubs with them? And how do you monitor their behavior relative to you know inventory depletion or too much accretion? Some of our wonderful analysts are thinking that accretion may be too much in the very near future but. Jerald G. Fishman Well I mean all the data thats out there indicates that the distributor inventories lower last quarter you know than they were the quarter before, so the data out there does not support that contention that weve seen. With the large customers, David, all we can really do is, you know, we do sell to some of them through hubs so we can really get to see whats there. We have very close contact with our largest 200 accounts and when we talk to them we talk a lot about supply. So all we can do is, you know, its not a highly quantitative model with the large customers, but we tend to have a reasonably good sense of you know the attitudes of our customers and whether theyre piling up stuff.  We have a lot of years of historical sales and inventory data from our large customers, so you know we crank through those numbers pretty hard. And when we get a sense that one of our large customers is building inventory on us, we talk about it quite directly with them. So again its not as quantitative as wed all like, but its qualitatively a pretty good indicator. David Wu - GC Research Ltd.  And approximately what percentage of your large customers are on hub at this point? Jerald G. Fishman I dont really have that statistic, David. I mean the ones that you know everybody has a hub with I expect we do, but I dont have that statistic handy. Operator Your next question comes from Terence Whalen Citi. Terence Whalen - Citi Jerry, I think in your concluding remarks you made several points and I was hoping to revisit a couple of these. I think a lot of the questions already have pertained to top line and gross margin. I was hoping to make this question about operating expenses. One of your first points was you said you were making changes that I think overall were intended to improve the customer facing experience. And then your second point pertained to fundamentally reducing infrastructure costs. I wanted to understand maybe two or three points specifically how you can balance those [explicit] goals of really improving the efficacy of your sales and distribution while reducing the cost of that. And the reason I ask the question is because I think as we see good sales growth, I think there might be some investment skepticism around the ability to really reign in the costs. Jerald G. Fishman Yes. Well, I guess the only way to prove that is to do it. But you know just conceptually the way were thinking about it is you know at Analog weve grown up as a product company over the years and as a result, you know, weve had a lot of different product groups all over the company that basically ran their businesses, did a very good job of doing that, and each of them was a relatively self contained business whose only goal was to grow and make money. You know, the change we made was basically to try to say that we have a business like that, but we dont need the level of decentralization in those businesses that weve had historically. And there are opportunities to get much greater benefit of scale, much greater sharing of technology, much less overhead costs in each of those businesses. And decentralizations a great thing in terms of getting focused but its a terrible thing in terms of cost.  So as you create more centralized ways of thinking about even the technology dimension of the company, I think there are great opportunities that weve seen and I think theres more to come in getting the infrastructure costs of the company down.  The other part of the mix there of creating these market facing groups is just a way of more efficiently dealing with customers. Again, when you have many, many product groups, you know I think at the peak we probably had 45 or 50 different product groups in the company, and every one of them was out there banging on the customers for their particular application or product. Its not a very efficient utilization of their time and its very inefficient for the customers and for our sales force to have to drag around 47 different product lines to these accounts. I think by a much more centralized look on a tactical basis we just save a lot of time and money in trying to deal with the largest customers. And we also can deal with them with the full breadth of ADIs technology. You know Id say lastly, and it might turn out to be of all these things the most important, is that we now can look at each of these market segments and set the priorities across the company rather than looking at 45 or 50 different product groups and try to set the priorities. And you know just in going through the 2010 planning process, you know, when were determined to keep the OpEx relatively flat and we have a lot of different people who have a lot of different ideas on what theyd like to do, just the strategic clarity that we can bring to bear on those decisions and the analysis that we can do of what were putting in and what were getting out of a particular market segment is much, much better, and has given us just a much clearer sense of where the moneys going, what the input/output ratio is in some of the things were doing, and therefore what are the investments that were going to continue to support, and what are the investments that were going to decrease our support in. It just is a much more efficient way of running the company. So I mean those things when you first look at them sound like they kind of balance each other. How can you, you know, drive more sales growth and get the costs down at the same time? But you know that is our job, to get good growth and to get the cost structure of the company down. And I think everybody around the company believes thats our job and were going to do that. And you know there are many skeptics out there about can you do that, but we understand that. But I think if usually the fourth quarter is a proxy for our determination on that, I think you can probably get a sense that were serious about that. Terence Whalen Citi  I think the follow up then is to Dave. Dave, I think in the past you talked about reaching a peak sales level, a prior peak sales level which was I think about $659 to $661 with about $200 to $210 million in OpEx. Now can you validate whether thats a reasonable modeling window. David A. Zinsner Well I think the way were thinking about it on OpEx as a target is really to target really in kind of the low $30s. Historically when were at kind of our higher peak levels of revenue, weve really been kind of in the mid-$30s. So we see trying to drive OpEx more into the low $30s as a percent of sales and couple that with a gross margin in the low $60s and I think you get a pretty good number for operating margins, well above kind of prior peaks. Operator Your next question comes from Steven Smigie - Raymond James. Steven Smigie - Raymond James I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the OpEx. Dave, I know you said I think dollar wise you expect only pretty modest increases going forward. Are there any you know short term cost reduction efforts you took during the downturn that have yet to come back into the numbers? David A. Zinsner Well weve taken a lot of actions up until this point to get the number to where it is. Were always looking to squeeze out efficiencies obviously, but the variable expense that could find its way back into the P&amp;L we think is essentially under our control. In fact most of it is variable comp thats tied to operating margins improving. So were in a situation now where we think the OpEx is in our control and we can kind of manage it effectively going forward really to drive to this kind of target, operating expense as a percent of sales. Jerald G. Fishman This is Jerry. That continues to pressurize us to keep looking at all the things were doing and prioritize. You know what were communicating around the company is that the worst thing we could do right now is you know sort of wipe our brows and say you know weve survived and everythings great, and now were back to doing it the way we used to do it. And you know we dont have to make hard choices any more. And the message that, you know, were communicating very candidly around the company is you know that process of continuing to see where the investments should go and prioritization and continuing to drive the costs down, those are not one time phenomena thats caused by, you know, the world falling apart last year. These are things that companies like ADI given the markets were in have to do every year. And thats what our plan is to do. Steven Smigie - Raymond James  And then just as a follow up, just for modeling purposes, would I expect then sequentially over the next few quarters percentage wise to see that keep trending down or could you have maybe one quarter where it pops up a little bit again? Jerald G. Fishman I mean, well have to see how the revenues go, but our sense is that that should keep trending down as a percentage of sales. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Dave, as we look at the gap between depreciation and CapEx, how much of that gap goes away as you get the two fabs shut down later this year? David A. Zinsner The two fabs are actually shut down, so we completed the last shutdown as of the end of this quarter. So as far as depreciation expense next quarter we wont have the Cambridge depreciation expense, although it was only I think $2 million a quarter. Really what will drive depreciation down further from here really is a function of the fact that were just spending less in capital. Now that is a function obviously of having two less fabs than we had a year ago. Jerald G. Fishman And less capacity. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company  And then as a follow up, just on one of the product areas, looking at power management it popped up, obviously still one of the smaller businesses but in the 28% sequential growth is that all just seasonality? Or are you starting to get some traction on some of the design activity that the companys been working on to try and grow that business organically? Jerald G. Fishman I think we are getting some good design traction and there was some seasonality in that number. So I think its both, but theres no doubt we, after a lot of investment, are beginning to get some traction on that business. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company  And in the past year youve talked about I think potential design wins in base stations and other, more traditional ADI type applications. Is that where youre seeing that happen? Jerald G. Fishman Oh, were seeing it happen across a wide spectrum of markets, those being one of them. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein First just to revisit the OpEx again, so OpEx this quarter was up $5 million. I know before you had about $20 million in temporary savings. So does this imply that all the permanent savings were there, you got $5 million back of the temporary or were there more permanent savings that also happened this quarter? Id also like to see if you could give me some feeling of what revenue level youd expect all temporary cuts to actually be back into the operating model. David A. Zinsner So as I talked about in the prepared comments, the $5 million increase was all as a result of variable comp coming back. So in a sense that was temporary cost savings when operating margins have declined a lot and now thats phased back in. Theres obviously always some amount of infrastructure related reductions that are phasing into our P&amp;L as well. You know it was in kind of that million-ish kind of range, the $2 million range this quarter. So it wasnt a lot of savings that flowed back into the P&amp;L in the fourth quarter. As far as when we get back to our kind of peak revenue levels and all our temporary reductions are back in, again I point again to our target. Our targets to get kind of the low $30s in operating expenses and this obviously as Jerry mentioned requires some rolling up our sleeves, but we feel like we have a good track to get there.  Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  And for my follow up Id like to see if we could visit the fab consolidations. So the last time I think you closed a fab was in Sunnyvale a couple of years ago, where you were targeting about $40 million or so in annualized savings. And when that was done you never really actually did seem to see those levels of savings realized in the form of structurally higher gross margins. Im actually wondering is there anything different from the current fab consolidations versus Sunnyvale? If you could just kind of walk me through maybe where I guess the savings from the last one went and what might be different this time. Jerald G. Fishman Well, you know, theres a whole bunch of effects that happen when you close a fab. And you know it turned out right after we closed that fab of course business went down quite a bit. And where you really see the benefits of that is you know when you can load up your other fabs and you get rid of some structural costs. I think the difference is this time we have taken a real large slug of capacity out. These were fabs that had a lot more expense than the Sunnyvale fab which was a relatively low cost fab. And were already seeing the benefits of that as you know weve come into these consolidations at the right time in the cycle where were going to start increasing utilization.  So if we didnt think that we could get all the benefits of these fab closures or many of the benefits, I think we wouldnt be saying that we think we can get the gross margins up above 60% because there would be no way to do that. So I think our sense of where, as weve gone through all the details of the cost savings, how its going to play out for the next couple of quarters under the assumption that, you know, the world doesnt collapse on us, we have a pretty good bead on. And those analyses indicate the kind of gross margins that Dave has been talking about. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  But the Sunnyvale actually wasnt that small in terms of the cost, right? I mean I think youd said you were targeting $40 million then. Its $65 million this time so its not that different. Jerald G. Fishman So Im not sure what the question is. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  Like you said you thought this time the cost savings were much bigger than Sunnyvale and you were sort of offering that up as one reason along with I suppose the business falling off with Sunnyvale is one reason why those were never realized. But I would think even if the business was falling off, most of that $40 million as far as I know was supposed to be labor related, so I would have expected to see in [inaudible] higher margins even then. Jerald G. Fishman No, most of the $40 is not labor related. Theres a lot of equipment you take off line, theres a lot of, you know, generally in a fab about a third of the costs are labor and a third of the costs are overhead and a third of the costs are all the other direct costs of running the fab. So you know everyone should look at it the way theyre comfortable looking at it, but what I would look for is what happens with the gross margins. And if the gross margins go the way that Dave and I have been planning and talking about, then we will have gotten very substantial savings in these fab closures. And if it turns out that theyre not, either something went wrong pretty significantly or you know these are all illusory and you dont get any savings when you close a fab. My guess is when history is written, and you know the reason that were comfortable enough to talk about these kind of levels is you know weve gone through a tremendous amount of detailed planning and those are the numbers that come out of this plan. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford Bernstein  So out of the $65 million from these minus then was the $5 million was depreciation and the rest was other stuff, labor and operating expenses. Is that true? David A. Zinsner No, I think it was about $14 million that was depreciation of $65 million. Operator Your next question comes from Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch I had a couple questions, the consumer business doing particularly well. Its at a quarterly run rate now thats not too far from the peak you registered before the downturn started. Can you help us quantify whats really helping with the consumer MEMs design win, a big driver, and have you maxed out that opportunity or is there more to go there? Jerald G. Fishman   Well it was really a combination of things. You know the more standard, traditional consumer areas in cameras and other connectivity parts of the consumer business did very well. You know we do have some good design wins in the MEMs consumer area that ramped up last quarter. You know we think theres a lot of potential for that going forward. So I think its really a combination of all those things that led to that growth. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch  And then on the Limerick facility, you know, you mentioned $5 to $7 million in benefits from savings in fiscal Q1 so when you annualize that number thats $20 to $28 million, so right in line with the $25 million you talked about, Dave. I guess my question is, is there more to come from that facility as you look into fiscal Q2? And if so, does that imply that the benefits from that restructuring are tracking ahead of what youd initially anticipated? David A. Zinsner Let me be clear. The $5 million of savings well see in Q1 is really associated with the Limerick consolidation, which is about a $40 million annualized savings. So were getting about half a quarters worth of savings on the Limerick consolidation in Q1. The Cambridge one just closed at the end of the fiscal year, so it takes a little while to digest the older inventory at the higher cost, so I wouldnt expect us to see any savings there until the back half of the year. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch  And that would be the $25 million? David A. Zinsner That would be the $25 million of annualized savings, yes. Sumit Dhanda - B of A Merrill Lynch And then the last question I have is for you, Jerry. On the auto business, two straight quarters of very good growth, I think you said 37% in the October quarter, but entering the quarter you hadnt anticipated a pick up after the strong growth youd seen in July. You know, do you have any sense of whether this is, I know youre guiding this business flat, but given that youre back to a peak run rate do you think weve over stretched in terms of the recovery in that business? Or do you think theres organic growth left to be had in that business into 2010? Jerald G. Fishman Well I think one of the reasons were optimistic about that business in 2010 is the product cycle were in in that business. You know weve put a fair amount of money in R&amp;D into that. I mentioned some of the product areas in my opening remarks that were having great success in. So I think, you know, if we were just thinking of the base line, you know given that you know all the clunker programs have sort of wound down, wed be more circumspect about the auto business next quarter or two. But our [inaudible] a very rich new product cycle in the auto business, which will counteract what probably were some one time events that went on in the automotive business in the last quarter or two. Operator Your next question comes from [Moniche Goyle] Crest Investment. [Moniche Goyle] Crest Investment Im curious about how to think about stock buyback in 2010. Jerald G. Fishman Well well have to just wait and see. You know we historically have had, you know, fairly aggressive buyback in different programs where we went out and started to accumulate a little more cash and a little more confident. We still dont have a lot of cash in the U.S. but anyhow well have to wait and see how that goes in conversations with our board. [Moniche Goyle] Crest Investment So Jerry just if you can explain, what are the factors and considerations for having a buyback program? Jerald G. Fishman Well, it has a lot to do with just where our cash is, you know, which is still predominantly overseas, and our expectations about whats going to happen with the tax regulations relative to that going forward. And also our perspective where the business is headed and what the distribution of the cash were going to generate is likely to be for the year. So we review that with the board once a quarter and were going to review that with them again this quarter at our board meeting. And then well get a consolidated view of heres whats likely to happen and well decide what to do. Operator Your next question comes from Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech Is it possible for you guys to remind me when your annual and promotion costs kick in? Jerald G. Fishman Typically they kick in in our second quarter, but we havent decided what were doing about that this year yet. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech  And then, Jerry, just in a little bit bigger picture looking at you know your fab situation utilization arent really that different from others across the analog industry. And we hear from most companies utilizations 50, 60% level. Now that demand sort of seems to be more normalized, if thats a fair statement, you know I believe theres a good risk investors are [audio impairment] about the risk that we see increased [audio impairment] pressure. Can you comment on what you guys are seeing? Why you dont think, when demand comes back, you dont see this pressure to take on that mentality of fill the fab? And Ill have a follow up to that. Jerald G. Fishman Well I think for us who have been in the high end of the analog business, the real key is that so much of the product portfolio is not directly [copyable] I would say, so you know we didnt see a lot of pressure on the ASPs when business got poor. And even though most people are [audio impairment] loaded, you know the product [audio impairment] that we compete in with most of the high end analog companies are not those that we primarily compete on price on. So you know weve been through a lot of these cycles and we typically on the upside or the downside dont see a lot of price pressure. You know we of course have prices that are lower on the existing products each year than the year before. Thats very natural, particularly for larger customers.  But on the other hand you know our job is to come up with very innovative products where you dont have a lot of competition and where even though, you know, that our job really is to create solutions for customers that are great value without reducing the price. So I dont think thats going to change very much. We dont see movement on the ASPs very much in aggregate through the company in any of these cycles. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech  That leads me into sort of volume pricing agreements that tend to be in the communications end market. Were sort of at the point and time of year where those volume pricing agreements sort of get set and awards are offered. Any commentary on what type of year-over-year ASP erosion you saw on those? Jerald G. Fishman Well again, we tend to supply more and more integrated solutions to the customer base youre talking about so I mean I couldnt quote you a specific number. I mean when youre selling the same product as you sold last year, theres always price pressure, particularly in certain regions of the world. What weve got to do is A, weve got to continue the innovation thing and secondly, weve got to make sure our costs are going down faster than the prices are going down. And thats what weve been doing for many years and I think thats what we have to continue to do. Doug Freedman - Broadpoint Am Tech  If we look at the coms market, it was really one of the better performing segments throughout the year. Have any of your communications customers given you an idea of what sort of their capital budgets are going to be for 2010, whether were going to see follow through and that segment sort of out performing? Jerald G. Fishman Well, from the conversations that weve had with the largest infrastructure customers, you know, in Europe, to some degree in the U.S. and certainly in China, you know Id say the feedback we get is theyre expecting 2010 to be a good year. You know its lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but I think in aggregate theyre enthusiastic about their prospects for the year and thats the sentiment theyve communicated to us. Mindy Kohl  Okay. Well, we appreciate your participation today and look forward to talking with all of you again during our first quarter 2010 conference call, scheduled for February 17, 2010. Thanks very much.

Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is February 17th, 2009 With that, lets begin with the opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerry Fishman Well, good afternoon, thanks again for joining us on this afternoons call. As you can see from the earnings release that we put out earlier, the first quarter was another very strong quarter for ADI and the beginning of what we hope will be a strong year for ADI. The recovery which began in our third fiscal quarter last year and picked up momentum in our fourth quarter has carried over into our first fiscal quarter of 2010. Our revenues grew 5.5% sequentially, during the quarter thats typically a seasonally slow period at ADI, after growing 16% sequentially the prior quarter. We are very encouraged that our industrial revenues grew significantly this quarter. This business spans many different applications in factory automation, process control, instrumentation, automatic test equipment, energy management, military and aerospace, and also healthcare, and is comprised of literally tens of thousands of customers around the world. Revenues from communications infrastructure and automotive also grew during the quarter. Its important to note that we are now breaking out automotive from the industrial category where we typically reported automotive beginning for the first time this quarter, given the fact that automotive has now become a more important strategic focus for ADI and is not getting to be a meaningful size relative to the rest of our business. Importantly, our lead times have remained short and we continue to deliver over 99% of our shipments to our OEM customers within six weeks or less. This is consistent with our performance in the previous quarter and represents what is typical lead times for ADI. Maintaining short lead times reduces the chances of excess ordering by customers. In addition, distribution inventory has remained stable at approximately eight weeks, which is also consistent with the prior quarter. This of course is positive in the short term as that allows to meet our customers requirements on a short-term basis, but I think equally important is the lasting impact that we believe it will have as am I sure ADI remains a trusted and reliable partner to our customers for the longer term. During Q1 we continued progress for making ADI a structurally more profitable company. Our gross margins improved by approximately 480 basis points sequentially and operating margins excluding restructuring costs are now 270 basis points higher than our most recent peak when quarterly revenue was approximately $60 million higher. We expect to continue to continue to expand the operating margins in coming quarters through gross margin expansion and continuing very tight control of operating expenses. We believe that we can retain approximately 50% of our expense reductions as permanent cost reductions, which is in line with our earlier estimates. As we entered this downturn, we set in place a strategy to be more focused on products and our markets that value innovation, and also to become a more profitable company. In some cases we increased investments, in others we slowed or ceased investments in areas where innovation was no longer the primary driver. As a result we believe we are very well positioned for solid growth and exceptional profitability going forward as the economies around the world continue to improve. So now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will provide more detail on our financials. Dave Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. Revenue was $603 million, a 5.5% increase from the prior quarter and a 26.5% increase from the first quarter of 2009. Our order strength continued last quarter and we finished the quarter with a higher backlog and a book-to-bill ratio above one. Gross margins were 61.1%, a 480 basis point increase from the prior quarter and a 470 basis point from the first quarter of last year. Although there are many different factors that impact our gross margin, the increase was primarily due to lower infrastructure costs, higher utilization, and a more favorable mix of revenue. Factory utilization was in the low 60s in the first quarter as we ramped production to match increasing order rates. Should business levels justify it, we can add significant amounts of internal manufacturing capacity quickly and with relatively little additional capital spend. Our goal continues to be to keep our lead times short and reliable. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $219 million including a $16.5 million restructuring charge or $203 million excluding the charge. This charge along with higher variable compensation expense resulted in higher operating expenses. The restructuring charge included approximately $5 million related to the final closure of our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility and represents the cost associated with decommissioning of that facility. The other $11.5 million reflects actions taken during the first quarter to continue to sharpen our focus in product development and reduce infrastructure expenses. When fully implemented, we expect these actions will result in savings of approximately $4.5 million per quarter. The remaining increase in operating expenses was due to higher variable compensation expense, in line with significantly higher operating margins in the first quarter. Variable compensation is primarily based on operating margins, which we believe tightly aligns the interest of our shareholder and our employees, given the historical relationship between operating margins and share price. Excluding variable compensation and restructuring, operating expenses were flat with the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating margins, excluding restructuring charges were 27.5%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, our tax rate was approximately 20.3% more typical for ADI than the unusually low tax rate booked in the previous quarter. We expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to continue at approximately this level. For the first quarter, excluding restructuring charges, we earned $0.43 per diluted share, which was an increase of 19% from the prior quarter on a 5.5% increase in revenue despite a change in the tax rate quarter to quarter. Weighted average shares outstanding increased by 4% to 305 million shares. This is the result of the exercise of stock options that were due to expire in the first quarter and a higher average stock price for the quarter as compared to last quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet, for the quarter we generated approximately $200 million in free cash flow or 33% of sales and finished the quarter with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and marketable securities with $380 million of debt. In line with the higher revenue, accounts receivable increased slightly in dollar terms this quarter. However, our days sales outstanding declined by one day to 47 days. Inventory declined $10 million to $243 million and the days of inventory remained low at 95 days. As I mentioned before, we believe that in inventory levels between 90 to 100 days is an optimal level given our mix of internal and external manufacturing. This keeps our carrying cost of inventory low, but allows us to meet the short lead time requirements of our customers. Inventory distribution increased slightly this quarter in line wit the increased sales in that channel. However, on a turns basis inventory remained flat with the prior quarter. In summary, from a financial perspective, this was another excellent quarter for the Company. Now, I will turn the call back over to Jerry. Jerry Fishman Well, thanks Dave. With regard to what happened in the end markets for the first quarter, our industrial business, which is now approximately 43% of sales grew 16% sequentially. You should recall as I explained earlier that industrial category no longer includes the automotive sales. We saw a broad based growth across many applications, including instrumentation and process control, test equipment, healthcare, defense and aerospace. Our revenues from our automotive customers, which now represent in the first quarter 12% of sales, grew an additional 5% sequentially after a few previous quarters of very substantial growth. While certainly some of the strength that weve experienced over the last few quarters is likely inventory replenishment, we are also the beneficiary of increasing electronic content per vehicle and also a very strong automotive product portfolio. The increased content in automobiles for ADI is driven by applications in infotainment and safety and in Powertrain electronics. In the area of safety, for example, the widespread deployment of stability control systems is driving growth for our MEMS gyroscope products. It also appears that consumers are gaining interest in advanced driver assistance features such as lane departure warning and reverse camera console views, many of which use our DSP or data converter and also our RF products. Our communications business, which is primarily products for infrastructure and to a lesser degree handsets, is now approximately 22% of our revenues. Revenues from communications customers increased 12% sequentially. The growth of this market is being primarily driven by the ramp and deployment of 3G base stations worldwide. While last year growth was dominated by heavy capital spending in China earlier in the year, in Q1 this year the growth was much more diversified. In the developed countries, the need for higher data transmission capacity is the main driver, while in developing countries the need to increase coverage is driving demand. We also saw an increase in revenues from the wireline communications market. Although today this is still a smaller piece of the communications business, its had very steady growth now for many quarters at ADI. Revenue from consumer related products declined 18% sequentially, which is generally in line with the typical pattern that we see in the consumer business for Analog given our the months in our first quarter. Our main focus areas in consumer continue to be in home entertainment products and digital cameras and also many portable products. On a regional basis, revenues grew in all our regions except Japan in line with the consumer business decline and of course Japan in that sense was down sequentially. So, I would like now to make some closing comments on the outlook and look at it really in the short term and also take a slightly longer term perspective or in at least our view whats happening around the world. In our Q2, which weve just now begun, we expect industrial sales to be both cyclically and seasonally strong. We expect further strength in the communications infrastructure as a result of additional base station deployments, including what we hope will be a resurgence in our growth in China. We expect consumer sales to be approximately flat sequentially. In total, we are expecting our revenues as we mentioned in our press release to increase to $635 million to $650 million, which would represent a 35% year-over-year increase in our sales at the midpoint of this estimate. We are planning the gross margins to increase sequentially to 62% to 63% and that would produce operating margins in the range of 29% to 31% in the quarter, and earnings in the range of $0.48 to $0.51. For reference, in the fourth quarter of 08, before the recession began, revenues were at a similar level to our Q2 forecast, but our operating margins were approximately five percentage points lower. So overall we believe we are executing well on our plan to deliver good sales growth, and attractive and increasing margins. I think there is very little doubt that there continues to be a stability in most economies around the world as in many locations around the world unemployment levels remain high and credit is still tight. Nevertheless, our business has broadly strengthened over the past few quarters and order rates and backlog levels are now approaching pre-recession levels. While the amplitude and the timing of the order recovery suggests that some of the order strength is likely due to a more confident supply chain as the economy recovers, we believe based on feedback from many of our customers in many, many different industries and many countries around the world that companies are generally more confident about the future and have begun to shift from a fear of over investing to a fear of under investing and losing global competitive position. As a result, many of our customers have begun to ramp new product program at a pretty significant rate and certainly that will benefit ADI in coming quarters. Despite these changing attitudes, which are generally more positive than three months ago, the bar for new investments at many of our customers is still stacked pretty high. Our customers are looking for partners who can consistently innovate to make their products more appealing and more competitive and also those wholl have a flexible supply chain to respond to changing business conditions. From productivity improvements at factories around the world to medicines to entertainment, to transportation and many other applications, our customers want products that allow their products to always be connected, to be easily used and to conserve energy. These strengths play very well to ADIs business strategy, which continues to be as it has for many years to focus on being the very best signal processing company in the world. In March, during our analyst day, investors will learn a little bit more about the trends we see and how they are driving many, many new opportunities for ADI. So, I hope you will all be able to join us for the webcast of that event. So, thats all the formal comments we are going to make today. Well now open the line up for questions from analysts. Dave Zinsner Thank you, Jerry. During todays question-and-answer period, please limit yourself to one primary question and no more than one follow-on question. Well give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we are now ready for questions from our analysts.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator  Our first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Barclays Capital. Romit Shah Barclays Capital Thanks guys and great quarter. Jerry, you had three quarters now of pretty substantial growth yet your revenue is still below the prior peak. At what point do you think youll catch up with demand or see the business return to more normal or seasonal growth rate? Jerry Fishman Thats sort of hard to predict into the future. You know, our sense right now particularly in the way that we are managing the distribution channel is that consumption and the demand we are seeing is not terribly unaligned [ph]. I think over the last couple of quarters weve caught up with what has been under consumption. Well, there is probably another quarter where thats going to be a little bit above the top, but I think ultimately once we get back to sort of where we were, which we expect to be approximately next quarter plus or minus a little bit, I think it will be in a reasonably good balance between what demand underlying consumption and the demand we are seeing. Romit Shah Barclays Capital Are there any segments within your business where you feel there is still pretty big supply-demand imbalance? Jerry Fishman I think for ADI, I dont see. There certainly was a supply and demand imbalance last year, but I think customers inventories, at least what they tell us are reasonably low. The distribution inventory that Dave was saying are relatively flat in terms of turns and weeks of inventory. Our lead times are short so they dont have a lot of inspiration to be loading up inventories. So at least for ADI, I dont see that patterns are very unique here. Romit Shah Barclays Capital Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Great, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations on the great results. This cycle so far you guys have clearly demonstrated better operating margin leverage than in past cycles. What can you do over the next few quarters as business continues to improve to make sure you keep that margin discipline and not let some of the expense creep come back in like it might have in other cycles? Thanks Jerry Fishman Well, I think as far as the expense creep we sort of early in the cycle said that some of the expenses that we reduced were going to come back with sales and those are mostly related to variable compensation and commissions. Others were permanent. And I think our sense is that about half of those things, which is consistent with the way weve been thinking about it are permanent and half of them are going to come back as the sales go up. So that basically allows us to operate the Company at about $100 million a year of less expenses than we had when we went into this cycle, which is not insignificant for our size. As far as keeping our hands on the  doing the right things, we do have a lot more focus on products and markets that are higher margin and more substantial than weve had in the past. I dont think we are going to revert back to having less focus. So I think that focus is going to continue. I think the entire management group and the employee base is pretty committed to keeping discipline on the expense line and I think with the goal that we set of keeping  gains on the operating costs, I think we have a good shot of doing that. I believe the gross margins in the Company is structurally higher. Part of that is of course due to volume and utilization, but another part of it is just due to a much richer product mix and us exiting businesses that had very poor returns over many years over the last two or three years. So, its always challenging quarter-to-quarter to predict whether the gross margins are going to be up a point or down a point, but I think we are up here at levels, which are about where the best weve ever been. We have a forecast for next quarter, which will exceed that by quite a bit, and I dont think there is anything in there other than the world falling apart thus having to bank down utilization and things like that, which are always its possible although not probable in the short term. Other than that, I think we have a good chance of not only keeping these margins, but as were forecasting for Q2 the margins are likely to expand again in Q2. Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Terrific. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Quick question again on the OpEx, so I know you said you are going to keep half of the gains. Do I define the gains at this point as versus Q408, so ex-restructuring youd be down $37 million quarterly? And does that mean that basically youd be creeping about call it $19 million or $20 million a year of those cuts going forward? Dave Zinsner No, I think the way you got to look at it is we were at $240 million in Q4 of 08 Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Yes. Dave Zinsner What we are thinking is that we brought the OpEx down to about $187 million, so we roughly took it down by a little over $50 million and what we are saying is that well be able to keep half of that difference as we resume back to the revenue levels of Q4 of 08. So, basically we feel like we permanently took out from the $240 million run rate burn rate we were in Q4 of 08, we permanently took out somewhere in the $25 million plus of OpEx expense or an annualized basis a little over $100 million. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it. So, some of thats already started to come back. So this quarter you are if ex-restructuring your OpEx was up, I think it was about 4% or so versus last quarter which is almost about where your revenue was up at this point, revenue was up 5.5%, how do we think about OpEx trending through the year again as revenue goes up because I know more variable compensation is going to kick in as the operating margin continues to increase potentially. Jerry Fishman Well, I think one way to think of that is, at least I will give you my view, Dave will give you his, is that weve been on a very steep part of the margin improvement curve. We raised the margins five points in one quarter. That tends to, given that most of the bonus payments are tailored to that statistic, it tends to drive it through the yard [ph], I think we have more margin upside as we are predicting for the next quarter, but we are not going to keep getting 500 basis points of margin improvement every quarter, so I think the rates of increase on the variable side is going to start trending downward. Its still going to go up in dollars, but the rate is going to go down from where it is. The thing that we are focusing on more than anything else is everything acceptance and if we can do what we are trying to do, which is to keep that part relatively flat through the year, I think the operating margins will keep going up and everyone will be very pleased with the operating margins that we are running in the Company. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it, thanks. And for my followup, I mean I notice now you are providing the end market breakdown with like a pure industrial, if I compare where you are this quarter to where you were two years ago, so Q108, I notice that for all these particularly in the broader industrial, you are almost back to those levels. I think you are only down about 4% Q1 2010 versus Q1 of 2008. I am not so sure that the industrial markets themselves are only down 4% from that point to this point, so whats actually driving I mean is it share gains or is it I mean we talked about customers moving back to replenishment mode and so forth but I mean whats what do you think is actually driving what seems to be probably a greater increase for your industrial sales and even some of your other product categories versus where the market probably is these days? Jerry Fishman Well, I think I mean its always hard to look at one quarter two years ago versus a quarter now to try to garner any specific, but I think generically, some of the segments within the industrial area for us, which has always been a source of significant investment are just growing faster than the average of the industrial market. If you take areas like the healthcare products, historically in these numbers here the automotive stuff  has been growing very well for us. And a few of the other segments where you just have very rich new product cycles going on in that market. So, Id say that, that business for us is doing a lot better than many outsiders, investors thought and certainly even better than we thought it was going to be a couple of years ago. And part of that is just that we are investing a lot of money in segments within industrial that are pretty high growth relative to most other segments. So I think we have a pretty good outlook for that business over the next couple of years. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it guys, appreciate it. Jerry Fishman Its certainly not the stodgy old growth business that some people want to call us. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Got it, got it, thank you guys. Jerry Fishman And it makes pretty good margins too. Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research Yes, indeed. Operator Our next question is from Terence Whalen with Citigroup. Terence Whalen Citigroup Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first part relates to I think last quarter you had talked a little bit about some restructuring and reorganization that you had done internally with regard to the sales force and how your sales force is interfacing with customer accounts Jerry Fishman Yes. Terence Whalen Citigroup And in addition talked a little bit about how that improved some of the granularity of your rolling up of the individual business units financials. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit of details what youve learned over the past quarter after implementing that reorganization and also what metric now that you are looking out on an individual business unit level, what you are learning from looking at this new metric? Thank you. Jerry Fishman Well, its a very important question. Well, let me try to give you a broad answer to it. Now I think from the way the experience that we had over the last couple of months, weve learnt something that we it doesnt sound like rocket science. We probably knew all along, but its really become true is that customers really value when we approach them from a single point with the breadth of our technology. And thats the way they prefer to deal with us. They dont like dealing with many, many different product lines that are basically trying to sell various products to them as compared to really trying to understand how to make them more competitive and therefore what solutions can we bring them to do that in a very cohesive fashion.  So, I think what it really has done is it makes the customers believe that we are a much more strategic partner to them in their particular business. It allows to focus the resources towards customers in a way that we havent been able to do before. And it really focuses the sales force on where it is that they ought to be spending their time and attention as compared to trying to react to the request for 47 different product lines for more sales in the quarter. So, you know, those are things that when you listen to me say, well thats sort of elementary. But for a company thats grown up as a product oriented company, it really this new organization has really helped focus what we are doing a lot more than it used to.  Now, is that changing our sales in the quarter right now, I dont think so, but I think what we are trying is the sales force is better focused on the right accounts. If they go into the customers with a much more cohesive plan, a much more cohesive roadmap, a much more ingrained understanding of what the customers are trying to accomplish, I think thats going to help us greatly. And weve gotten that kind of feedback from some of our very largest customers that in applications where they just found us too complicated to deal with they really appreciate the fact that we are we understand their application, we got to make them competitive and we are approaching that from a single point. From the internal metrics standpoint, it gives us a much clearer sense of where we are making money and what the investment levels are relative to the returns I the marketplace, and now when you are product oriented company its somehow hard to understand that by market segment. Now, we have a tremendous amount of data that really shows which of the segments growing faster, which of the segments are taking more investment, what are some of the returns that we are getting on the R&amp;D in each of the segments, and as a result of that not in the quarter-to-quarter numbers, but certainly a we put together the yearly plans, we take that into account in what we do about allocating resources to various marketplace.  So, I think in aggregate its it really helped us deal with customers and it helps us to grow [ph] at a more productively allocate resources in the Company, which in companies like ADI its very hard oftentimes because of the complexity with 10,000 products  customers. I mean thats really going to sharpen our focus and weve already seeing the benefits of that. Terence Whalen Citigroup Thanks for answering comprehensively the broad question. As my followup Id like to be a little bit more specific with regard to gross margin, weve got utilization in the low 60s and we are looking at a 62% to 63% gross margin. Specifically is the longer term gross margin model then going to be closer to 64% to 65%? Thanks Jerry Fishman Are you asking that or are you saying that as a conclusion? Terence Whalen Citigroup That was a question, thanks. Jerry Fishman Well, when we get to 63% maybe well talk about higher numbers, but we are certainly a lot more enthusiastic about gross margins we can generate this fiscal than we were when we were really struggling. And I think investors were struggling to really think could we ever get to 60%. And I think now we are comfortably past 60% we certainly be very comfortably past 60% next quarter and I dont think thats a one-time event either given that we are still not breaking the growth that will allow utilization. So, well see how that goes after another quarter and well update you next quarter. Terence Whalen Citigroup Thanks and a nice job. Operator Our next question is from Uche Orji with UBS Warburg. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Can you hear me? Jerry Fishman Yes. Dave Zinsner Yes. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Alright, thank you very much. I wanted to just follow on same one thing, Jerry, what was your peak utilization rate and I know thats also that things are going to gross margins, but I just wanted to try to get a handle if we were to get back to peak utilization rate just what could be the optimized [ph] gross margin. Jerry Fishman Well, the utilization rate relative to the past years, somewhat complexity right now since we had two more fabs. Last time we were at this thing. One of the reasons the utilization went up this quarter, there are really two reasons, one is we started more wafers, but the other part is weve taken a lot of capacity offline. We took the Cambridge fab offline and we took the eight inch fab in Ireland the six inch fab in Ireland offline. So, those comparisons relative to the past are a little bit more challenging to make. Now I would say that if utilization goes up our gross margins will go up. Thats intuitive. Its very hard to quantify that any more definitively than that. At below 60s, we can easily run fabs up until the mid 80s. I think that will have a positive impact on the margins. As Dave mentioned earlier, we can increase our capacity relatively quickly with relatively low capital expenditures. So I think relative to capacity and the margin implications of that I think we are in reasonably good shape. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Great. Can I just ask you about power management, I mean weve started to see some numbers  close to $40 million of revenue for the quality advantage? Can you talk about you expectations for this business now? What will be the drivers, whats allowing you to gain traction now and what should we be expecting from this going forward? Jerry Fishman Well, our power management business grew this quarter pretty well. It grew fairly substantially year-over-year. And I think there is a couple of reasons for that. One is the fact that the team has been working at it for a couple of years and its congealed, and weve got a pretty good group of people that are developing some products that our customers say are pretty good. I think another part of it is weve focused our product development into areas that we really think we can offer something very unique and the customers value as compared to trying to do things that a lot of other companies can do and you are just in a margin war with them to get those sockets. And I think the more that we align our power management business with our vertical market segments, we are we can go into customers where we already have a substantial part of the signal processing bill of materials and we can say you know by the way we can either integrate power management on the signal processing chain or we can offer power management alongside of the signal processing chain and the customers already respect us for our prowess in developing products and they like working with us and that becomes an important ingredient in the overall solution and the more that we focus our product development efforts in those areas as we have for the past year or so I think the more traction we are going to get in that business. So, I think like everything its a combination of things, but overall we are doing better in that business than we have in the past and I think there is good expectations that if we continue to really focus that business in the areas I just addressed we can do even better in the future. Uche Orji UBS Warburg Right, thank you very much. Operator Our next question is from Christopher Danely with JP Morgan. Christopher Danely JP Morgan Hey, thanks guys, and, yes, Ill add my congrats on hitting new peak gross margin. On it seems like the mix and the focus is changing a little bit via the end markets and products. So, can you just give us your sense on where you would expect the highest and lowest relative growth rates for your end markets for the rest of this calendar year? Jerry Fishman Its hard enough to predict what the sales are going to be. The market segments are even more challenging with more granularity. But because we just dont have all that much visibility up until the second half of the year. But I would say that we expect that well get growth across the board, which is where weve been seeing weve seen good growth in industrial, weve been seeing good growth in communications. I think in the second half of the year the acceleration in communications in hopefully going to come from China; its what we now expect. We are seeing good growth in automotive. The consumer business is relatively cyclical. In these quarters they are low, theyll pick up again when the season changes. So, I dont think it will be anything unique personally in the segments. I think it will be more typically of what we usually see. Certain quarters we get higher industrial growth, certain quarters we get higher consumer or communications growth, but I dont think there will be anything unique for the balance of the year that at least we understand right now. Christopher Danely JP Morgan Okay, thanks. And then my followup for Dave, Dave, I think you said three things that the gross margins went up. Where any of those I guess having a bigger factor than the others? Dave Zinsner No, they all had a meaningful contribution to the gross margin improvement. Christopher Danely JP Morgan And then can you give us a sense of what your incremental gross margins will continue to be as the utilization rates climb? Dave Zinsner You know its challenging to do that because we do some the revenue will come from external manufacturing and in that you dont get any incremental benefits from versus the internal, so its a kind of a tough metric to really quantify. Jerry Fishman There is not an in respect to that there is not an entire we can't draw the curve between gross margins and utilization. So it has a lot to do with product mix. I think right now would be sort of what I think seems to be pretty aggressive guidance for Q2 on the gross margin after what we just achieved. It sort of gives you an indication of at least directionally where we are thinking its going to head. Christopher Danely JP Morgan Yes, okay, thanks a lot guys. Operator Our next question is from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird Hi, just another question on gross margin. Youve given us the mix the gross margin sequentially increased, if you look at your revenue guidance, which is very close to what you posted in the second quarter of 2008, your gross margin guidance is also 150 basis points higher than two years ago. How much of this do you think will be mix and then within those that base station play will in those? Jerry Fishman Dave? Dave Zinsner Yes, I mean I couldnt answer that question. I mean what really drove the year over or the comparison from Q408 was we took a lot of infrastructure cost out. We are taking we took out of Limerick six inch facility and that contributed a lot to our gross margins and then going forward well start to see the benefits of shutting down Cambridge, and that will show up in our P&amp;L and thats going to be driving the kind of the future performance. So, Id hazard a guess that it probably didnt have a meaningful impact from mix or utilization. It was really about fundamentally lowering the cost per unit of our product. Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird Okay. And eight weeks of inventories at distributors is probably unusually even though thats stable with the previous quarter. Is your guidance assuming any type of inventory replenishment and what type of feedback do you get from distributors over the next for the next few quarters? Dave Zinsner Well, on a guidance perspective, it doesnt really matter, because we recognize the revenue once the distributors ships this out of their inventory. So Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird And then for the gross margin? Dave Zinsner Sorry, what was that? Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird And then for the gross margin, so are you is your guidance building the fact that you are going to ramp production to replenish inventories at distribution as well? Dave Zinsner Well, as we indicated, we thought some of the drivers in the gross margin from the next quarter would be from utilization, a higher utilization this quarter versus last quarter, but we are also fundamentally lowering the cost per unit. Well start to see more benefits from the closures of the two facilities. So that will help as well. Jerry Fishman We tend to work very closely with the distributors to keep the inventory in weeks at about a constant rate. Certainly if the sell through in distribution keeps going up the dollars of inventory distribution will go up and that will low utilization a little bit, but thats we are trying to keep the weeks or the turns in distribution about constant as we have over the last couple of quarters. Thats how we deal with distributors and thats how we are planning to continue to deal with them in the coming quarters. Tristan Gerra Robert W. Baird Right. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Thanks guys. Nice job on the gross margins. With margins above 60%, what options do you have as you look ahead given the tailwinds on utilization, mix, what have you, with either new end markets or new application penetration? Jerry Fishman Well, we continue at Analog despite our better focus to have a lot of irons in the fire and I think what we are going to continue to do is invest in the things that we are investing in. Thats sort of occupying most of our bandwidth. We think if we execute on those things we can have a pretty attractive growth rate. We are going to talk a little bit about this in more detail about at the analyst meeting next month here in Boston of what the segments are, where the growth drivers are, and so on. But I think the the thing we are going to really try to do is just keep focused on the things that we are committed to and I think as we do that, we execute, I think the growth rate will take care of itself. Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Okay. And then its the followup. Dave, you mentioned an action that triggered $11.5 million charge in the fiscal first quarter. How many other efficiency actions like that do you foresee as you look out over fiscal 10? Dave Zinsner Well, you know, its hard to predict. I would say that we are not really anticipating any additional actions like that. But I do think that there are things we can do on the infrastructure side to continue to more efficiently spend our money that will help offset some of the increases well see on the variable comp side and will help us fund other development actions that we might want to take advantage of. Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Okay, thanks guys and nice job. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong Wells Fargo Thank you very much. Your guidance, does that include restructuring charges or are you assuming there won't be restructuring charges in the coming quarters? Dave Zinsner We are assuming there won't be restructuring charges in the coming quarters. David Wong Wells Fargo So, your OpEx does go up by a fair amount equal at least offset that whole of restructuring charges $16.5 million is that right? Dave Zinsner Its not going to go back, $16.5 million, is that what you are asking? David Wong Wells Fargo Right, okay. And my second question, have you been able to supply product for the increase in demand youve seen in all areas or are there some segments or product types where there are shortages? Jerry Fishman In general, we are able to supply pretty much all of our products. I think I mentioned the statistic that to our OEM customers, which are about half of our sales, our largest customers, our lead times are within six weeks. And I think thats where we like them to be. And thats where they are. So, we dont really have a lot of shortages going on in the product group. David Wong Wells Fargo Right. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with Broadpoint AmTech. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Hi guys, given I am playing ping pong between two calls, I hope I dont step on a landmine here, but has anybody gone into the details on what caused the other section of Analog to be down 22%, can you give us a little insight into whats happening there? Jerry Fishman It was mostly to do with consumer products and that tends to bounce around a lot with the quarter to quarter numbers. So I dont think there is any real data there. If you look at the history of that thing, it bounces around quite a bit because its much more sort of market specific and customer specific products as compared to the broader categories. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Okay and is a fair amount in that business still coming from the MEMS segment and are you guys still pretty bullish on your MEMS outlook? Jerry Fishman Yes, I mean there is a lot of the MEMS products are in there. That tends to be very lumpy quarter to quarter. The previous quarter we had a very large one-up in that business as a result of a particular program that won very large customer and he bought enough for the whole next couple of quarters because it was a ramp of a new product he had. And we didnt get much business on that last quarter, but our position with that customer for the future is very, very good. So, its mostly, as I said, lumpy demand, heavily consumer, and thats why you saw those numbers. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Great. And then if I could one last one sort of trying to focus on end market demand. Are you guys able to see if the demand spectrum is broadening? Are you seeing a larger number of customers coming in and ordering or are you just seeing demand from your existing customer base return to a more normal levels? Jerry Fishman I think its a pretty broad based at least as we are hearing through the distributors we are . And I can't really say if its if theyve increased their customer base or what the exact details are the order patterns. But you know we are seeing it in new products and old products, we are seeing it in just across the board in many, many different product areas. And so I really dont know the specifics of that if there is any real data in the are there more customers or the same customers because I just dont know. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Alright. I guess may last one, are you feeling or thinking that there is any impact to any of your end markets from supply constraints in one direction or another? Jerry Fishman Well, we always worry about that with some of the lead times out there in the industry are pretty long and you always worry a little bit about is is that causing people to buy everything faster than they normally would, but we are trying to keep pretty good track of that and its not obvious that thats really impacting things a lot although thats something we always worry about and we watch it pretty carefully and well have to wait and see how that develops. But its certainly not what the customers are saying to us and what our distributors are saying to us. So but, on the other hand, we are always the last to note. So its really hard to predict it. Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Alright. Terrific and congratulations on strong results. Jerry Fishman Thank you. Operator There appear to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Zinsner, Mr. Fishman, do you have any closing remarks? Dave Zinsner Yes, so thanks for participating. We are looking forward to talking to all of you again at our analyst day and just as a remainder thats scheduled for March 11th, 2010, and it will begin at 7:30 AM Eastern. So have a good day.

Mindy Kohl Thank you. This is Mindy Kohl. I just want to apologize that I have a bad case of laryngitis today, so I'm going to turn it over to Dave for the opening remarks. David Zinsner Thanks, Mindy, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Dave Zinsner, Vice President and CFO. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you haven't yet seen our second quarter fiscal 2011 release, you can access it by visiting our website at analog.com and clicking on the headline on the homepage. This conference call is also being webcast live from analog.com, select Investor Relations and follow the instruction shown next to the microphone icon. A recording of this conference call will be available today within about 2 hours of this call's completion and will remain available via telephone playback for one week. This webcast will also be archived on our IR website. Participating in today's call with me are Jerry Fishman, President and CEO; Vincent Roche, Vice President of Strategic Market and Segment and Worldwide Sales; and Robbie McAdam, Vice President of Core Products and Technologies. This is an opportunity for you to get more color on the markets and product segments since we have Vince and Robbie joining us today.  During the first part of today's call, Jerry and I will present our second quarter fiscal 2011 results as well as our short-term outlook. The remainder of the time will be devoted to answering questions from our analyst participants. During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain nonrecurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operation and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website. In addition, we have updated the schedules on our IR website which include the historical, quarterly and annual summary P&amp;Ls for continuing operations as well as historical, quarterly and annual information for revenue from continuing operation by end market and product type.  Next I'd ask you to please note that the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information which may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is May 17, 2011.  With that, let's begin with opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald Fishman Well, good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on today's ADI call. Our second quarter was a great quarter for ADI, of course, virtually every dimension of our business, with results that were way ahead of the earlier guidance that we provided last quarter. Revenues were $791 million, which were up almost 9% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by strength in industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure products, which increased sequentially by 14%, 12% and 7%, respectively. Sales of consumer products declined by 7% sequentially in Q2. Order rates were very strong in Q2 and our book-to-bill ratio was above one. Over the course of the quarter, orders were generally strong in February. They spiked in March in reaction to industry-wide uncertainty caused by the events in Japan and leveled off to more normal rates in April, which were in line with what we would normally expect on a seasonal basis. In managing ADI going forward, it's very critical that we carefully understand the upside that we experienced in Q2 and properly plan with that upside for the balance of 2011. Our best answer after analyzing all the data is that there are 3 principal factors that came into play in the second quarter. First, clearly the earthquake and tsunami in Japan resulted in less business for ADI in that region in Q2, as many factories were shut down and consumer demand dropped following these disastrous events in Japan. Secondly, the events in Japan likely caused an industry-wide acceleration of buying by customers to build some safety stock. Despite the fact that ADI's lead times remain short and we got very few product shortages, we believe that customers, some customers anyhow, had some proper inventory of ADI products during the quarter. While we don't believe that this was material to our results in Q2, it was nevertheless a factor. The net of those 2 opposing forces, in one sense Japan being weaker and the other sense some acceleration of orders in the second quarter, we estimate probably increased our second quarter revenue by approximately $20 million. However, it's important to note that even with this upside caused by these events, revenues would have been above the high end of the range that we communicated at the beginning of the quarter, indicating that the fundamental demand for our products is very strong. Lastly, our results were led by continuing strength in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure products, all markets which are growing and robust in most geographies and markets in which ADI is extremely well positioned. In addition, we have very little exposure to the computer market and to the low-end cellphone market, where competitive price pressures and uncertain demand patterns are certainly at the current time eliminating market progress. Our outlook for Q3, which I'll comment on a little bit later in the call, will take into account all of these factors.  So now I'll turn the call back to Dave, who'll provide a few more details about our second quarter financial results. David Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, second quarter revenues were $791 million, increasing 9% sequentially and 18% from last year. Gross margins were above guidance at 67.6% in the second quarter, a 140-basis-point improvement from the prior quarter and a record for the company. The increase in gross margins was driven by better utilization on higher sales and a favorable product mix.  Operating expenses for the second quarter were $236 million, a $13 million or 5.8% increase from the prior quarter. The increase was the result of a planned salary adjustment, the first in 3 years, which took effect at the beginning of the second quarter and other related costs, along with some modest strategic hiring. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses declined to 29.8% in Q2 compared to 30.6% of revenue in the prior quarter and 33% a year earlier.  Operating profits for the second quarter were $299 million or 37.8% of sales, up 220 basis points from 35.6% of sales in the prior quarter. Here again, operating margins are at record levels for the company. The increase in operating margins was the result of the higher sales, continued strength in gross margins and tightly controlled operating expenses. For the second quarter, operating profit increased sequentially by $39 million or 15% on a $62 million or 9% revenue increase. This represented a 63% drop-through of incremental revenue to operating profit. Other expense was approximately $1.7 million compared to $600,000 in the prior quarter. The increase was related to interest expense, which increased as a result of the $375 million 3% coupon bond that we issued on April 4.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was just over 22% this quarter, in line with expectations. We expect the tax rate to remain at approximately 22% next quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.78 and non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.75, excluding a onetime tax benefit. This compares to diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.70 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.66 in the prior quarter.  Our cash generation continues to be strong as we generated 25% of our revenues or $197 million in operating cash flow, and our cash balance now totals approximately $3.4 billion, of which approximately $1.2 billion is in the U.S. Our Q2 cash balance includes the $375 million 3% bond I mentioned earlier. Net cash at the end of Q2 was approximately $2.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $34 million, which resulted in free cash flow of $163 million or 21% of revenue for the quarter. In addition, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares or $68 million worth of ADI stock in the second quarter. As a result of our strong financial performance and cash flow and our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase to ADI's quarterly dividend to $0.25 per outstanding share of common stock. This increased dividend will be paid on June 15 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 27. Our accounts receivable balance increased sequentially by approximately 8%, in line with our revenue growth, and our days sales outstanding remained flat to the prior quarter at 48 days. All of our customers are current to their terms. Inventory at the end of the second quarter increased by 4% sequentially and our days of inventory were 104 days compared to 105 days in the prior quarter. Our distributor inventory expressed in terms of days of inventory was up slightly, in line with distributors' more positive outlook on business conditions and remains at target levels of approximately 8 weeks.  Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in excellent control with 99% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 6 weeks. Overall, from a supply chain perspective, we have not experienced any material impact from the Japan earthquake and tsunami. We have no manufacturing facilities in Japan, have not experienced any shortages of raw silicone or processing and packaging materials and as our lead times show, we did an excellent job supplying to upside demand from our customers in the second quarter. In summary, by every financial and business metric, this was a very successful quarter for ADI.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, who will discuss the results from each of our end markets and provide our short-term outlook. Jerald Fishman Well, with regard to our market performance in the second quarter, in the second quarter, our revenues from the broad and diversified industrial market, which includes industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare, grew 14% sequentially, reaching a record level of $384 million. Our strong results were primarily driven by growth in the process control and instrumentation markets, with most other application areas within the industrial category showing sequential improvement as well. In addition, we saw strong sales both at our large OEM industrial accounts, as well as within our work base of smaller industrial accounts. In aggregate, industrial revenues represented 49% of our total revenues in Q2. Overall, we continue to believe that the industrial market offers significant long-term growth opportunities in line with ADI's overall corporate growth rate, driven by our customers' need for energy efficiency and higher performance in industrial automation and advanced instrumentation equipment, as well as an increasing trend to substitute capital for labor in modern factory build outs around the world. For the balance of 2011, we expect industrial sales to remain strong, a prediction that is supported by leading industrial customers who've reported that they believe underlying conditions in this market are very solid. For example, Siemens and ABB, which are 2 of ADI's major industrial customers, in their most earnings announcements reported double-digit increases in new orders, underscoring the strength in their respective businesses. We believe that ADI is very well positioned to benefit from the momentum that these and many other industrial customers continue to see. Revenues from our automotive customers were $106 million in the quarter, an increase of 12% sequentially from the first quarter. That would get another record for our Automotive business, which in Q2 represented approximately 13% of our total revenues. Leveraging our strengths along the signal chain and sensors and signal conditioning and data converters and in DSPs, ADI has developed a very compelling portfolio of solutions in the area of safety, entertainment and also power train electronics. In this portfolio, along with a more robust market in automotive worldwide, continues to drive our success. During Q2, safety systems represented a large portion of our business in automotive, with particularly strong sales in the area of stability control, which is a new large market opportunity for ADI technology. In addition, infotainment remained strong in the areas of hedge units and audio amplifier and in powertrain products, we experienced continuing success with our battery management products, achieving record revenue levels in Q2 with sales of key products such as our intelligent battery management solution which is used in lower emission vehicles. Looking ahead, we expect automotive to continue to be an important growth driver for ADI, and we believe that we'll continue to benefit from favorable macro trends within the automotive space in the areas of active and passive safety, entertainment and fuel efficiency, all of which together should continue to drive higher dollar content for ADI. Communications revenues at $176 million for the quarter were up 7% versus Q1 level. Sales to communications customers accounted for about 22% of our total sales in the quarter. During the second quarter, escalating the adoption of smartphones and the accompanying data growth, continued to drive cellular market expansion in Europe, in North America and also in China. For ADI, wireless infrastructure sales surged in Q2, driven by a strong base station demand as competing operators remain focused on aggressively expanding their capacity and their footprint. We believe that ADI will continue to benefit from this expansion as a result of the need for broadband high performance mixed signal radios and base stations and a point-to-point system. Less than 10% of our communications infrastructure revenues in Q2 were derived from TD-SCDMA equipment in China, which given the large sequential communications revenue increase we saw in Q2, really clearly demonstrates the underlying strength and most importantly, the breadth of ADI's position in the wireless infrastructure market worldwide. Our current estimates are that TD-SCDMA revenues will begin to increase in the second half of the year as TD-SCDMA deployments we hope resume in China. Wired communications, although down slightly quarter-over-quarter, were up year-over-year in Q2 and continued to trend upward on an annual basis. Though moderated to some degree by constraints on capital spending in the short term, we expect that the fundamental demand for higher wire traffic will continue to drive growth in this business for ADI over the longer term. Going forward, we expect that communications infrastructure will remain a key area of opportunity for ADI, driven by the explosion in mobile broadband data usage and continued mobile subscriber growth, pushing infrastructure capital spending to new high levels. In the second quarter, our consumer revenues were down 7% sequentially, primarily due to events in Japan as well as weaker consumer spending environments worldwide. Our Q2 revenues from consumer customers were $111 million and accounting for 14% of ADI's revenues. During the second quarter, increased revenues from portable consumer products partially offset weaker revenues in digital camera products, while home entertainment revenues were essentially flat, sequentially. And finally, our computer revenues were flat sequentially, but represented now just 2% of ADI's total revenue. As most of you are aware, the computing market is not a space where ADI is supplying almost any R&amp;D resource. So let me now turn it to the outlook for Q3. Overall, business was very strong for ADI in Q2. As I mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, industry-wide uncertainty about supply related to the Japan disaster likely accelerated some demand, which is not expected to repeat in the third quarter. At the same time, our order trends were strong throughout Q2. And we're entering Q3 with a book-to-bill ratio above one and higher where we have opening backlog, which together indicates continuing growth in the demand for ADI's products. In addition, our customer forecast indicate continued strong demand for industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure products and also some recovery in consumer products, particularly in Japan. In aggregate, as a result of strength in our end markets coupled with our continuing ability to supply upside demand, we're now more optimistic about what we can achieve in 2011 than we were when the year began. As such, we're planning for our third quarter revenues to be in the range of $765 million to $795 million with a midpoint of about $780 million, which is above our original plan for Q3. We expect continuing strong gross margins in the range of 67% to 68%. We expect operating expenses to be flat-to-down slightly sequentially. We believe that this should result in earnings from continuing operations in a range of $0.70 to $0.75, which were also above our original plan for the third quarter. In summary, I'm very pleased with where ADI is today and also where we're headed. Our heightened focus, coupled with secular strength in the markets that are strategic for ADI, is producing above market growth rates and makes such that the margin more optimistic about achieving the long-term growth rates that we've projected. Clearly the benefits of strategically focusing our R&amp;D on higher margin and sustainable markets is beginning to pay off for ADI. And our fundamentally lower and more variable cost structure is resulting in one of the most profitable business models in the semiconductor industry to date with upside opportunity and some downside projection. Most importantly, our employees understand and support where we're headed and are enthusiastic about ADI's future and the role that they continue to play in our success. In a recently completed survey of our 8,500 employees around the world, we noted very significant improvements in virtually every category of employee understanding and employee satisfaction, which together are generally a very good leading indicator of our future success. By design, we're in the right places at the right times with a highly capable and energized workforce. And our growth in financial returns, which we believe will continue to drive superior returns for our shareholders, are indicative of the strength of this position. Mindy Kohl Thank you Jerry. During today's Q&amp;A period, please limit yourself to one primary question, and no more than one follow-up question. We'll give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we're now ready for questions from our analyst participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danely from JPMorgan. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co First question, a little longer term, can you just talk about the gross margin drivers for the rest of this year, and then maybe throw in what the utilization rates are right now? David Zinsner Sure. Well, let me start with utilization. Utilization was about 80% this quarter, and it was about 75% last quarter. That's likely to come down a little bit next quarter. We'll modulate our inventory build a little bit and we do have a shutdown planned over the July 4 holiday for the Wilmington site. Long term, I think obviously, at these gross margin levels, we're pretty pleased we certainly exceeded our original expectations that we provided to you in the Analyst Day back in early 2010. I think most of the driver going forward has a lot to do with revenue, both in terms of the absolute dollars of revenue driving margin expansion as well as if the utilization creeps up beyond the 80% levels we're at today. Jerald Fishman I think the other part of it that's really been fundamentally a better product mix that we've had over the last year or 2, so we've really increased our focus in the B2B space. And certainly, those markets provide proprietary gross margin opportunities in some of the other higher volume and much more competitive segments. So I think that the combination of the utilization -- we have the factories properly sized that we can get the upside that we need, even though we had $30 million or $40 million more revenues than we thought we were going to have, but yet we have extremely low costs in those factories. So I think it's really a combination of it. Certainly if utilization creeps up, the gross margin should respond well to that. And certainly as the product mix continues to evolve more towards the B2B space of the business-to-business base, I think that could have some positive drivers as well. So as Dave said, we were wondering about a year ago if we could sort of get past the 63%, 64% area on gross margins. I think now we're comfortably above that, and we're looking around for continuing opportunities to move that. So we'll have to see how that goes, but those are the primary drivers. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co And for my follow-up, just a little more color on Japan. If you guys could, can you estimate how much of the weakness is due to demand versus, is anything on the supply constraints side? And then how did you guys arrive at the $20 million number? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, first of all, there was a word in front of the $20 million that said approximately, so this is not a scientific calculation about that. What we did is we looked at some of the -- our logistics group and the people we're servicing the customers looked at customers that they know pulled some orders in and we made some estimates on others and we came up with that number based on the best guess we have from looking at our large customers and our small customers. By definition, it's a very complicated number because we serve 60,000 customers around the world in all these different countries that are all going through different cycles. But I thought it was important to try to come up with an estimate of that to properly set the stage for Q3 and Q4 because there were some onetime things in Q2 when we want to try or at least put boundaries on that to help everybody understand what were the onetime benefits that we got and what we're sustaining, part of the growth curves that we're operating on is. So I mean, we don't have any -- we don't have a spreadsheet that adds up to plus or minus $10, obviously. We just have some guesses in the large and the small customers about what happened. The best guess we have is that the events in Japan and the Japanese market probably cost us $5 million or $10 million in revenues in Japan and the rest of it was upside that we got from other customers. So that's if we had to make a guess, that would be the guess of the balance that we saw. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co Okay, great. That's very helpful. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc The first question is a little bit high-level question regarding buyback. It seems like secularly, ADI is doing very well in end markets, having very good uptake of its products across a number of applications. And it appears based on the margins and the returns that you're generating that your stock looks cheap at these levels. I was wondering, given that you have a fairly large authorization, why weren't you more aggressive in the buyback this quarter? Jerald Fishman Well, a bunch of reasons. First of all, for a large part of this quarter, the world was a very uncertain place, and there were people that were projecting the world was going to come unglued. They couldn't get substrates, they couldn't get plastics, they couldn't get wafers and we were concerned about that as well early in the quarter, so we're a little bit more hesitant. The other part is, we just raised the cash balance in the U.S. We did a financing in early April to get a larger cash balance in the U.S. to give us more flexibility in the future to do that. Right now, based on the results, we decided to raise the dividend substantially as one indication of that. But I think that opportunistically, as we've said and we've proven in the past, we tend to be retro buyers of our stock when we think it's appropriate. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc Okay. And then as my follow-up, I was hoping that maybe Vincent or Robbie could chime in on what are maybe the 1 or 2 key take aways from progress on the reorganization of the sales and products groups a year and a half ago? I'm looking that their view on maybe 1 or 2 of the most positive and a sense of that, and also perhaps one setback that they've encountered as well. Vincent Roche Okay. Well, maybe I'll chime in on that one. I think there are 2 very, very tangible benefits we're seeing at this point. I think, one, the strategic planning process in terms of how we allocate the vital resources in terms of R&amp;D, our fuel resources and so on. We've gotten a lot more strategic clarity around now where it is that we want to play and how it is that we create the win for the company. And I think as well, we're just in terms of being able to engage with our critical customers, the key customers, in terms of really getting a granular understanding of their needs and being able to define products in a way that address those needs in the most aggressive and innovative way, those are 2 term benefits that I see at this point in time. Robert McAdam Yes. And I mean, I think it's about -- Robbie here. I think it's about having a much more clarity and certainty about our long-term strategies and knowing that we've got winning strategies and knowing where we don't, in fact, have changes. Jerald Fishman I'll throw an answer in on the hardest part of the question, the second half of your question, Terry. The hardest part, I think in this thing is, we have radically turned ADI upside down in the last couple of years. I mean, the numbers and the results we're getting are not just normal things that happen. So we've changed the strategic balance in the company tremendously on where we're putting money and where we're not. We've gotten out of businesses. We've increased investment in other businesses. We have virtually the top 30 people in the company in different jobs primarily than they had, including Vince and Robbie, I would say, than they had 18 months ago. And when you think an organization that is as large and complex as ADI and you try to transform it in the ways we have, both on the strategy side, on the operational efficiency side, on the cost side, we've changed direction on many, many things we were doing to get to where we've got. And it just takes time in the organization to get everybody around to that point of view. I mean, one of the reasons we did this survey that I mentioned earlier in my comments, and we really didn't exactly know what the results of that survey were going to be when we did it. So one of the reasons we did it is we really wanted to see if there was some really significant fundamental movement in the way people were thinking about what was going on in the company and what they saw what the issues are. I think the larger issue that people have seen as a result of that in private company is that they're from different jobs and they're adjusting to it, and it takes a while and their perspectives are different and they don't get to make some of the decisions that they used to make on their own without regard to what customers wanted and so on. So I think those are just things that we're pushing our way through. I was very pleased by the results we got in the survey. When we look at some of the numbers, I mean, people really believe things have changed here, and they're generally very enthusiastic about the change. I just wish, like always, it would happen faster. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc Very helpful color, Jerry. Jerald Fishman Unlike you guys, who give us long periods of time to see results. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc That's great. Operator And we have a question from the line of Uche Orji from UBS. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank This is Parag for Uche. Just had a question on your results on the outlook. Even if we adjust the impact from Japan, the polling for demand, your loss was better than many of your peers. So just one thing, is there any other dynamics that are at play, like, you're seeing any acceleration in combination of design wins or any industrial gain that you're seeing better revenue than your peers? Jerald Fishman Well, I think the third part of the mix of the quarter that I mentioned in the opening comments was we're doing extremely well in the B2B business right now. And for markets like industrial, where many people believed it was sort of a slow growth, stodgy market. And at last year's analyst meeting, we had the guy that runs our industrial business stand up and say that his goal was to grow that business as fast or faster than any of our other businesses and everyone sort of rolled their eyes and said that was not really possible. And I think I mentioned in one of the last couple of quarter calls that I really believed the guy and we're seeing that. There is usually industrialization going on in many countries in the world. There's a tremendous substitute of capital -- industrial capital for labor going on every place in the world. And the industrial business with a push on efficiency and so on is really creating great opportunities for our technology. And so I think when you look at that market, the infrastructure market, I mean, the reason that generically we're doing better is because the market segments that we're strategically committed to, market segments where we've added resource at the expense of other market segments where we retracted resource, I think those tend to be markets that are doing extremely well right now, and that's one of the reasons that our performance is differentiated right now. I think secondarily, we've created a great model with our operations and logistics people where we are able to respond very rapidly to upside and downside demand and take care of our customers, and that helps us a little in these -- in the short term, we get a few more orders and we get to pull a few more sale, but I think long term, we've created an environment where customers really believe they can rely on us. And I think that's a big competitive advantage in the longer term. So I think it's those reasons that, really, as we've analyzed everything, are contributing to some of the upside. Parag Agarwal - UBS Investment Bank Okay. And just a follow-up on the industrial market. You indicated that you expect to see a continuing demand momentum going forward. But if we look at the macro data that is coming out, that seems to indicate some slowdown on the industrial market. So just wondering, how do you reconcile the 2 data points? And also within the data... Jerald Fishman Well, you have to have a point of view in trying to manage this business, and we tend to listen a lot more to what our customers are saying than to what economic sagers are saying right now. So we've always had a philosophy over the last couple of years that we're going to build what our customers say they need, and we're going to keep the lead time short and we're going to deliver to them when they need the product. And if it turns out that the customers are wrong, then we'll have a little bit too much inventory, which generally is not a problem for us because a lot of it lasts forever given the product cycles that we have. But the one thing that we can't afford to do and that we won't do is try to second-guess our customers of what they're telling us over the next few quarters. So we're going to build what the customers say they want, and we're going to be prepared to respond to upside if it's a little bit better. And we're going to be able to throttle pretty quickly if it looks like they're not meeting their forecast. That's all we can do in running the company. Because if you read all of the summaries and you try to track all the economic analysis, I mean, it just gets very confusing. And I think you make very large mistakes by doing that. So we have a very simple model. The customers tell us they want it, we build it. Operator And we have a question from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. The first question is just, you breakout on one of your categories, it's amplifiers and RF. On the RF side, I was hoping you could talk about where you see you guys now, product wise, and what that roadmap might look like for your products in that category over the next couple of years. Robert McAdam Well, the RF -- our RF business actually has various aspects, and the largest portion of it is in communications infrastructure. As we've said over the years, we are at a very strong position, data converters in the communications industry except for the base stations are the main parts. And over the last 7 years, we've been investing in components in the RF and we've been billing our share aggressively over that. The second part of the RF business is in the industrial space, a lot of smart metering, a lot of industrial and communications and remote sensing, and our narrowband RF pallets are selling in those bases. So we just see RF in the final frontier in terms of performance frequency and we have said the business has been growing very steadily versus the last one. But we haven't -- we have and we'll continue to increase our share in the base station area as increased considering -- that's actually one of the driving factors over the last year and a half. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. Okay. And I just had one quick follow-up on gross margin. I apologize if you touched on it but in the past, you'd indicated a couple of drivers for margin were going to be pricing the products a little bit better. And then the other thing was you had certain products you thought you could design for manufacturability in a better way. I apologize if you've touched on that but if you haven't, could you just give us an update how far are you in terms of those 2 issues, or is there still room left to get some more margin gain out of that? Jerald Fishman Well, certainly, those are all factors that led to -- if you look over the last year or 2, gross margins are up 12 points or something, 13 points. So those are all factors that are contributing to that. So I'd say that that's a never-ending mission at Analog. We're continuing to bang on the products where the margins are and what we want them to be. We're continuing to look for opportunities to keep the price levels up and -- particularly for the older products, where customers really value the fact that we'll supply them for 20 years. So I think a lot of those things are areas that we just continuously focus on. And before it's successful, that ought to help, and -- but it doesn't end. It hasn't ended with where we are today. But no, we're not going to predict the future on that until we get, so -- but overall, that's a continuing program at ADI is the best I can say. Operator And then we have a question from the line of Shawn Webster from Macquarie. Deepon Sen Gupta  This is Deepon for Shawn. I had a question about your Communications business. It looks like it's reaccelerated during the quarter despite the weak China spend. Can you talk about the dynamics of that market? Is there some kind of dollar content story that's taking off here at LTE? Or what else do you think is going on here? Vincent Roche Yes, we have -- our business is strong across the 3G, and now we're seeing an emergence of 4G technologies being deployed in areas like America, for example. So typically, 3, 5 years ago, our business was heavily 2G, a 2.5G base. The content we're getting per system in the 3G and 4G systems is higher with each progression from across the generations. We're getting typically higher value content per system, and I expect that to continue in the future as well. So that's a big, big part of it. So I think part of the story is that there's just more deployments across the board in general as operators scramble to meet the capacity needs to be able to meet the consumers' need for mobile, video, data payload increases. So I think in general what we're seeing is a mixture of macro trends and ADI getting more share per customer and more content per system. And I expect that to continue in the years ahead. Jerald Fishman I think one of the takeaways that I commented on in the opening comments was that our business grew pretty significantly despite that TD-SCDMA has been sort of much lower over the last 6 to 9 months. And that just goes to the breadth of the deployments that are going on in our position with customers who are supplying to a much wider market than just China. So I think we look at that as a good leading indicator for the future because eventually the TD-SCDMA deployments will pick up and we'll get that on top of what we're already getting in the broader market. So with the large infrastructure customers, the top 5 or 6, ones that had up to 90% of the market, we have extremely strong position, and that's really helping us. There were a lot of -- there used to be a lot of comments and fears that most of the business was China, and that if TD-SCDMA slow down, that business will disappear. I think the fact that we're doing this well without any real growth there is very concerning for us. Deepon Sen Gupta  That's very helpful. Also, public sector. There's been some commentary, especially Cisco this week about a weakening public sector. People's -- obviously, Washington has had a lot of issues with budgets. Are you seeing any weakness in the defense sector or any kind of other public business that you have? Robert McAdam No, I think we've seen a little growth. We loop aerospace and defense into the same cluster. And we are seeing, I would say, very, very moderate growth there. But I don't see any particularly discernible trends on the public sector effect on our business. Deepon Sen Gupta  But you don't see any weakness going forward or anything to cause concern? Robert McAdam That's a relatively small portion of the business. Jerald Fishman Yes. I mean, that's a small part of that industrial category. We thought from time to time we ought to grow that more, because our products are very suitable in many of those applications. But we just haven't had a huge focus on that. Maybe that's some opportunity for the future, but it's not a very large portion of our sales today. Operator And we have a question from the line of Sumit Dhanda from Citadel Securities. Ian Eigenbrod This is Ian in for Sumit. Just a question. Could you comment a little bit on orders quarter-to-date and how that may relate to the level you saw in February, sort of pre-earthquake spike? David Zinsner I think what I can tell you is the oil level that we had for the first couple of weeks was pretty indicative of what our guidance is. Ian Eigenbrod Okay. So maybe just to ask differently, if you kept the current rate, would you expect a positive book-to-bill in the quarter? Jerald Fishman We really just don't know. So I mean, we -- the quarter is only 2 weeks old. We tried to take a look at it and see if our universe changed in the 2 weeks since we ended the quarter. I think what Dave said, it hasn't, and I think that's all we could really say or try to project based on 2 weeks of data. Ian Eigenbrod Okay. Good. Fair enough. And then just on automotive, Jerry, I think you touched on this a little bit. Could you pause that Automotive business between the sort of core traditional safety business and maybe some of these newer infotainment and powertrain applications? Is it -- are those new apps half the business today or more or? Robert McAdam Maybe on the safety business, it's not airbags anymore. It's a descriptive tool. So we've seen a lot of growth in the actual lens-based part of our business, which is really around stability control, anti-skid systems using our gyroscopes. And the remaining growth is coming from, as we mentioned earlier, battery monitoring, engine sensing and just all of the additional segment processing that goes around making cars more efficient whether they're -- and those are many casting cars to date, and that's where most of it is coming from. But the traditional core, as you call it, lens business has transformed from being an airbag business to being a stability control business, and that's where we kind of get... Jerald Fishman As well. Vincent Roche As well as that's we're getting the growth. Jerald Fishman Yes. We've mentioned in the past the gyroscope products that were an enormous invention. And in fact, just last quarter, we promoted the guy who sort of invented a lot that in Analog, the fellow in Analog, which is our higher technical chief. And it's really gotten a lot of traction. I mean, our gyro is unique in the industry. It offers tremendous advantage. And stability control is a huge opportunity going forward, because it's legislated in many countries now. And so I think that's one of the areas that we're getting a lot of upside in, and I think we will continue. But I don't have the breakout of how much that business is versus the engine control. I mean, down in the ranks we probably do, but I don't have it handy here. Operator And there are no more questions at this time. Mindy Kohl Okay. That concludes our Q&amp;A session. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again for the third quarter 2011 call on August 16. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is August 16, 2011. With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI CEO, Jerry Fishman Jerald Fishman Well, good afternoon. As you know, from this afternoon's press release, ADI's revenues for the third quarter were approximately $758 million, which was up 5% from the same quarter last year but down 4% sequentially from Q2. As you may recall, we were somewhat cautious about our Q3 revenues, given our well-above seasonal 9 to 10 revenue increase sequentially in Q2, which we believe was in part, the results of inventory builds in the supply chain due to Japan earthquake-related supply chain disruptions and the fear of industry-wide supply reductions.  It now appears as if customers built more inventory than we anticipated last quarter, and they liquidated it more rapidly than we had planned for. Notwithstanding these perturbations in supply, most of the end markets we serve remain relatively stable in Q3, particularly the communications market, the automotive market and also the industrial markets.  Our Consumer business recovered slightly in Q3, but less than we have planned at the beginning of the quarter. Our revenues in Q3 were impacted by 2 distinct drivers, both of which we believe had more to do with supply-chain issues than end demand. First, a portion of the revenue shortfall was a result of a few communications infrastructure customers, delaying orders to ADI in response to component shortages from other vendors, as well as the liquidation of excess safety stocks that they built in Q2. Our shipments to these customers returned to more normal levels in July.  While there were many other puts and takes at our other large customers, for the most part, revenue at those customers was in line with our forecast. The balance of the shortfall was from the 50,000 small and midsized customers, served through our distribution channel. Our distributors report that their customers have been burning off excess inventory, particularly from suppliers like ADI, who had consistently short lead times and kept up with the increased order rates that we experienced in the second quarter.  Recent conversations with our 2 largest distributors indicate that inventory reductions are proceeding in an orderly fashion with few cancellations and few backlog adjustments. I think it's instructive to look at the end market trends in both Q2 and Q3 to better understand these trends and most importantly, the implications of those trends going forward.  Industrial revenues declined 5% sequentially in Q3 after growing 14% sequentially in Q2. This looks to us like an inventory build in Q2 that was reversed in Q3. On a year-over-year basis, industrial sales for the quarter grew 8%, which is consistent with our expectations for the industrial business over the long term.  While our largest industrial customers in the United States and Europe are somewhat more cautious than they were last quarter at this time, for the most part, they're planning for a stable environment for the balance of the year. And our industrial sales in China, are continuing to grow.  Automotive revenue declined 5% sequentially in Q3 after growing 12% sequentially in Q2. Year-over-year, our Automotive sales for the quarter grew 21%. We now have significantly more content in autos than we did last year and our revenue is more dependent on content growth than on unit sales. We're extremely well-positioned in the automotive market.  Our current forecast for our automotive customers are also stable in the near term, and unless the economic outlook changes drastically, this market should remain an area of strength for ADI going forward, as our automotive revenues are now running at a rate in excess of $400 million annually.  Communications revenues declined 7% sequentially, after growing about 7% in Q2. On a year-over-year comparative basis, Communications revenues grew 10% in Q3. It seems very clear to us that our Q3 revenue was significantly impacted by both Chinese and European customer order push outs, which resulted from the shortage of other vendors' components and also the associated inventory and balances that existed in those accounts. While there are still concerns about short-term demand in United States and Europe in this sector, the Asian markets report that demand remains strong and are optimistic about the balance of the year.  Consumer revenue was up 4% sequentially after declining 7% sequentially in Q2, and was up less than we planned in Q3 and down 14% year-over-year. This year-over-year decline is primarily the results of our intensifying focus on only higher value-added consumer applications, where a technology is highly differentiated and our position is sustainable over many generations. Nevertheless, we have seen some improvement in our short-term backlog for consumer products, which is seasonally very typical at this point for the year and we're hopeful that this business will stabilize further during our fourth quarter.  On a geographic basis, revenues increased sequentially in Japan and also in China but decreased sequentially in the rest of Asia, in Europe and in North America. While our Q3 revenues were below the plan we had for the quarter, we did react quickly to protect the downside. As a result, even on a lower revenue base, our gross margins remained about 67%, operating expenses declined 2% sequentially, essentially flat for the same quarter last year, and our operating margin was just under 37% of revenues.  Inventories grew only slightly and operating cash flow totaled $257 million or 34% of revenues during the quarter. Including $0.01 that resulted from a tax catch up, earnings were $0.71, which were in line with the guidance range we communicated last quarter. Dave in a few minutes, we'll discuss more details of these financial results.  As far as the order rates in Q3, clearly, orders weakened for us in May and continued at these lower levels throughout the quarter and also into early August. And not surprisingly as coincident in time with our significant reduction in the fears that were industry wide about chronic supply shortages. Nevertheless, our order rates have stabilized at these levels. And as of now, it show no signs of further deterioration.    Our OEM backlog, which includes forecast orders from our largest customers, declined only slightly during the quarter, while our backlog from distribution declined more than that as a result of our distributor's stated commitment to reduce their inventories, particularly for suppliers like ADI, who provide very, very short lead times.  During the inflection points like Q3 when supply is very strong, orders have proven over many, many years, not to be a very reliable indicator of future sales, since turned orders tend to comprise a much larger percentage of quarterly sales. We believe that the consumption of our products in Q3 was above our recorded orders as a result of inventory reductions at many customers. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave to talk a little more detail about the financial results and I'll make some closing remarks after Dave is done. David Zinsner As Jerry discussed, third quarter revenue was $758 million, a decline of 4% sequentially, but an increase of 5% from the same period last year. Our gross margin remains strong despite the sequential revenue decline coming in at 67.2%, down 40 basis points from the prior quarter, and within the range we indicated on last quarter's call. The decline was due to decreased loadings in our factories versus last quarter.  Operating expenses for the third quarter were $231 million, down $5 million or 2%. In the third quarter, we benefited from our lower and more variable operating expense structure, in particular, from lower variable compensation payments versus the second quarter. Toward the end of the quarter, we implemented cost control measures, which also helped reduce expenses. We plan to continue these programs in the fourth quarter to protect our profits.  Operating profits for the third quarter were $279 million or 36.8% of sales compared to 37.8% of sales in the prior quarter. Obviously, operating profits were down both in dollars and percentage terms as a result of the lower revenue in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Other expense was $4 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior quarter, the increase was the result of incurring a full quarter of interest expense associated with the $375 million bond offering we completed in the second quarter.  Our third quarter tax rate was 20%, down from 22.1% in the second quarter, as we revised the annual rate to 21.3%. We expect the tax rate in the fourth quarter to be 21.3% as well. Diluted earnings per share was $0.71, within the range of guidance we provided last quarter. This compares to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.75 in the prior quarter. As I just mentioned, we revised our year-to-date tax rate to 21.3% for the year, which lowered our third quarter tax rate to 20%. This catch up provided $0.01 benefit to our EPS.  In addition to solid profitability, we maintained strong cash flow performance, generating 34% of our revenue or $257 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $37 million, resulting in free cash flow of $220 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter.  During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares or $66 million of ADI stock and distributed $75 million in dividends to our shareholders. At current stock prices, at least as of the close today, our dividend yield is now around 3.2%.  Yesterday, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid to shareholders of record as of September 14th -- sorry, as of August 26, 2011, and we pay it on September 14, 2011.  We closed the third quarter with $3.5 billion in cash, of which $1.2 billion or 33% is in the U.S. Net cash, excluding approximately $900 million in debts was $2.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. Our accounts receivable balance decreased sequentially by 10% due to lower sales, and our days sales outstanding decreased 3 days from the prior quarter to 45 days. Inventory at the end of the third quarter increased by 2% sequentially and our days of inventory were 110 days compared to 104 days in the prior quarter.  Although we were planning for higher sales, we were able to react and slow the inventory build towards the end of the quarter. Our distributor inventory increased a few days and is now slightly above target levels. As a result, we expect distributors to reduce their inventory levels in the fourth quarter. It's important to note that the reduction in distributor inventory will not impact revenue since revenue recognition does not -- or since revenue does not get recognized until after the distributor ships our product to the end customer. However, we are cognizant of these inventory adjustments at distributors and is factored into our plans for this quarter.  In summary, despite lower-than-expected revenue for the quarter, we delivered strong profitability and cash flow and we expect this to continue. Over the course of the last 2 years, we have fundamentally lowered our cost of manufacturing, which has driven record levels of gross margins over the last several quarters. We believe that the lower cost per unit will also benefit us in the periods which can make rev demand weaker, by keeping gross margins considerably higher in previous troughs. We have also created a lower and more variable cost structure for operating expenses, one that is highly responsive to both upside opportunity, as well as the need for downside protection.  We believe our model, coupled with vigilant operating expense control, positions us well to respond to whatever market fluctuations may occur in the fourth quarter. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, who will discuss the short and long-term outlook Jerald Fishman Well, obviously, planning revenues in the short term is very challenging. On one hand, we believe that most of the decline in Q3 was the result of supply inventory imbalances and therefore, could be short lived. If we had recorded a more normal seasonal Q2, our Q3 revenue would have been at or above Q2 levels. That scenario would imply that Q4 could be a normal seasonal quarter for ADI, or approximately flat to down slightly compared to Q3.  Our internal forecast indicate some sequential growth in Communications infrastructure and Automotive revenues, offsetting the slight decline in the Industrial revenues, with Consumer growing seasonally.  But nevertheless, this increasing uncertainty in many parts of the global economy is very possible that all this chaos will cause a decline in demand as customers become more cautious and push out new programs and consumers reduce spending on discretionary items.  If that occurs, we could see a decline in all of our end markets and our revenues could decrease sequentially. We really have no way to predict which way this will go. So as such we're planning for revenues to be in the range of $715 million to $755 million, or flat to down approximately 6% sequentially.  I think when history is written, we believe that our Q3 will be mostly about supply issues and our Q4 will be mostly determined by end demand. We all have to recognize that there's a wide range of possibilities of what demand might be in Q4, given all the economic uncertainties that we are reminded of, every single day.  So currently, we are planning to reduce production levels in Q4 to bring our inventory levels and distributors and on our balance sheet, down to more appropriate levels. Therefore, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 65% to 66% of sales, depending on the revenue levels that we achieve.  We also plan to carefully manage operating expenses and expect operating expenses to be flat to down 3% sequentially, also depending on the sales we achieve. So with these levels, we expect diluted earnings for the quarter to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.68.  Our best course of action right now is to be very cautious in the short term and work on the things that we can do to control and work on to limit the downside, while remaining very flexible to capture any upside that comes on our way. We've reduced discretionary spending and we're planning to reduce production levels to keep inventory approximately flat to Q3, assuming that we're somewhere at the midpoints of our guidance.  We believe we can respond rapidly if the demand pattern improves and we intend to keep our lead times very short as we have in the last few years. We have a very natural hedge in our operating expenses as our variable compensation plans react quickly to reduce revenue growth. We're also working to ensure that we're allocating critical, strategic resources to the most important programs and away from the less-strategically relevant programs that we've invested.  We're confident in our ability to manage through this period and return to solid growth at extraordinary margins and cash flow as the world becomes more stable. While our quarterly results year-to-date have certainly been whipsawed, by supply gyrations, it's important to put our 2011 fiscal year in better focus.  If we achieved the midpoint of our guidance for Q4, our revenues will have increased by approximately 9% over last year to over $3 billion in 2011 for the first time in our history. Our gross margins will have increased by approximately 150 basis points. Our operating expense growth will be well below our revenue growth and our operating margins will have improved for the year to approximately 36%. Operating cash flow will likely approximate $900 million, and at today's price, our free cash flow yield is approximately 8%. These results are in line with what we plan to achieve in fiscal 2011, and we believe that we're executing well against our plan.  While we can't predict the near-term future any better than anyone else, we do believe that if we're given at least a neutral economic environment, ADI could continue to grow with credible rates between 8% and 12% a year, keep improving our operating performance and keep generating a very significant amount of cash. Mindy Kohl Thank you, Jerry. We're now turning into Q&amp;A period, please limit yourselves to one primary question and no more than one follow-up question. We'll give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Uche Orji with UBS. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Let me just start by asking you, there's been so much parallel drawn about this current environment with 2008, and some companies are commenting that we've already been seeing early signs of double-dip recession. The question for you is, how similar do you see this environment in 2008? And also, what is the level of ADI preparation just in case the environment deteriorates much further than your companies are guiding at the moment? I mean how much prepared are you now, relative to '08? That's my first question. Jerald Fishman Well, of course, we don't know any more than everybody knows about what the future and to talk about what's going to happen economically around the globe is the subject, and continuously, about great conjecture about what's going to happen. But at least that's the way we see it. There are a couple of factors that tend to convince us that this is not a repeat of 2008, 2009 in the demand patterns we're seeing. The first thing is in 2008 and 2009, we saw very significant weakness in a few market segments and this time, when we look at all the product segments and all the market segments that we serve, we saw them all go down at about the same rate, which to us seems to indicate it's more -- at least for us in Q3, it's more about supply than demand. The other fact that our distributors point out to us in our recent conversation is that they haven't seen a lot of significant cancellations or backlog adjustments, which indicates to them mostly what we're seeing is an orderly reduction of inventory rather than the severe dislocations that we all experienced in 2008 and 2009. So at Analog, unlike many other companies in the industry, we had a very significant run up in Q2, well above our seasonal rates. When we grow 9% sequentially in the quarter, that typically, we'd grow 4% to 5%. That sort of rates that there was an inventory built in the channel and most of what we saw last quarter from both the distributors statistics and also the commentaries from our largest customers, the great thing to believe, it's much more about -- at least in Q3, much more about supply than demand. It's also interesting in Analog what Dave mentioned when we reported our distribution sales, which were half of our sales were sellout. So last quarter, the distributor's built quite a bit of inventory, which shows up as revenues for many companies, but not revenues for Analog Devices.  So while we would all that up, and we listened to the comments from the large customers, the comments from our distributors, at least in Q3, I believe we will come to believe that it was mostly about supply gyrations, not demand. I think as far as what happens in the future, we really don't know. You could read this report or that, you can read a summary or that, I mean this editorial of New York Times or another one of The Wall Street Journal, and there's a bunch of opinions out there of what's going to happen. And we can't predict that, which is why the range of possibilities for Q4, at least as we see it, is very large.  In the short term, as, I think, Dave indicated and I made some comments on, we're really being careful on discretionary expenses. We have a natural hedge on our expense growth with the variable comp plan, which when -- last year's results were coming in, was paying at an extremely high rates and has now cycle down pretty hard, and will continue to as results are getting better. We're reallocating resources to the projects and the segments, and the customers that are the most strategically relevant for us. We have very low and variable manufacturing cost structure. So I think we're in pretty good shape to react to anything the world throws at us, although I would repeat, we really just don't know what the world is going to throw at us next quarter. But I think we have a very resilient business model now, much more resilient than it was 2 or 3 years ago, much more of our costs of variable and our product portfolio is lot less volatile than what it has been. So again, if the world goes to hell, our results won't be that great, but I think we're well-suited to respond to whatever the world throws at us. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Can I just ask a quick follow up. Let me just speak on Automotive. You've seem to have grown regardless of all the dislocations now. Question for you here is, how much more runway do we see for growth in automotive? And if you can talk about segmentation by region, or also by type of car, high end or low end, you have to of course understand, what's driving that growth and how much further there is to go? Jerald Fishman Well, historically, I'll ask Vince to comment on this in a few minutes to get his point of view. But historically, most of our growth in the automotive market has been in the higher-end cars, which are much more feature rich and have much more safety and cockpit measurement going on. So historically, we've done the best with European manufacturers, and some of the high end America manufacturers. More recently, we've done well with some of the Asian manufacturers as well. So I think at the end of the day, that business has been growing very robustly for us. We have very strong position in that business. Just last week when we were talking to the guy that runs our Automotive business for us, he tends to be very well-connected, to the build rates that our customers are forecasting. And everyone is nervous, but he's sort of indicating to us that he understands the build rates and they're commensurate with the kind of numbers and direction that we've indicated. So we'll just have to wait and see how that turns out. Vince, do you have anything else? Vincent Roche Yes, I think just a follow on to Jerry's points, we are very well penetrated I think today in the mid to high ends. The diversity of our business is quite good in the Automotive sector. We supply into the safety sector, the monitoring sector, sensing the battery control and infotainment. And Jerry said there's -- in the scripts, there's basically a huge demand. We're just capped by the rate at which our customers can absorb the technology. There's no fundamental limit on the performance requirements that they've got. So as -- it's not a question of unit volumes for ADI. We're very well penetrated, it's a question of just how well car sales move in the mid to high end and we'll be there. We'll do well I believe in the future. Jerald Fishman This definitely is just -- the automotive industry ADI has emerged from, the early days when it's mostly about airbags and safety features. And even though that's still a very important business for us, particularly with our new gyroscopes that we're selling a very high volume right now. There's just so many other applications, essentially that sensing and entertainment applications that really require very, very high end analog technology and DSP technology. And it's those applications that are really driving our growth Operator The next question is from Craig Ellis with Caris and Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Jerry, it was helpful to get the geographic color on Industrial. I'm wondering if you can talk about some of the specific submarkets as well, such as medical, automated tests and others. Are you seeing similar trends in terms of order activity there? Or is there a divergence, given the diversity of end markets? Jerald Fishman Well, it's similar but it's like slightly divergent. The test equipment market certainly is at the margin weaker than it's been in line with all the uncertainty in semiconductor demand out there. I think that's clear. And the medical market was probably a little weaker also to just the hospitals, really worried about capital spending and new medical course constraints in the United States and all the other parts of Obama care. But I think the other markets, the industrial automation market was still pretty strong. Instrumentation market, process control is still pretty strong. So these aren't meaningful differences, Craig, but they are notable differences in some of those end markets. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Okay, that's helpful. And then, Dave, you had mentioned that there are 2 benefits to OpEx. One was just the variable comp program, and then I think you mentioned that there were specific OpEx initiatives that you put in place and are working. Can you go into a bit more detail on what those are, and how much benefit are you getting in the flat to down 3% guidance in the out quarter for us? David Zinsner Well obviously, it wasn't until towards the end of the quarter that we started to recognize that we might need to put some things in place. So we really probably didn't get too much benefit in the third quarter. Although it was generally around restricting, hiring and starting to eliminate some of the more discretionary oriented parts of the P&amp;L. And that's expected to continue this quarter to make sure we maintain the appropriate level of profitability. Jerald Fishman I think, Craig, the other thing that goes on is, when things get a little uncertain or soft, we tend to raise the bar on strategic investment and where we put the money and how patient we are in some areas that we can carry in. So I think of the margin as we go into 2012, that's going to continue. That's not a -- necessarily a reaction to softer order rates, but more a reaction to -- we have just such an enormous opportunity in some segments that we want to make sure that irrespective of what happens in the environment, we can continue to fund those things. And that sometimes takes much greater selectivity and there's more uncertainty out there. But I think the most important thing is the basic rudiments of our cost structure, it's just much more variable than they were a couple years ago, and that really hasn't hurt us much on the upside when business is great, paying large variable comp payments there, every employee in the company really helps us. But on the other hand, it really helps us on the downside when we can keep a lot of the strategic programs going and still get the benefits of being very responsive to the softness that this -- for a period of time in the order rate. So if the world really is catastrophic, we'll have to think about it differently. But right now, we think that's -- we can keep the expenses moving in the same direction as the revenues. Operator The next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG Jerry, you talked about the cost structure variability before. I think a year ago, you mentioned that about 17% of your OpEx was variable. How was that in comparison today? Jerald Fishman Yes, so obviously, it came down this quarter in reaction to the lower revenue. So it's about 12% of our revenue is now variable. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG So as you go forward, that percentage you think will adjust, so you become increasingly variable or the fact that the revenues are falling as fast as they are and your costs are fixed, you're going to make that percentage actually stay where it is? David Zinsner If we're in an environment where OpEx needs to come down, that probably becomes less variable as the variable aspect of the operating expense starts to decline. But revenues start to go the other direction, then it will expand with revenues and increase as a percent of... Vincent Roche I think the way to think about some variable comp plan is that, I believe we indicated a few quarters ago that there's a very simple formula that there were 2 elements of. One is the operating margins. The other one is sales growth. So the fact that we're still earning very significant operating margins, means there's still significant variable comp payment at the company, even thought the growth rate has tailed off in the quarter. So I think, you start getting into where the world starts coming on glued, I think we still got plenty of room on the variable side for those payments to go down. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG I guess as my follow up, Jerry, you talked a lot about the supply disruptions being a bigger issue than the demand side. If demand were to stabilize from here, how long do you think it would take before the supply side of the equation was brought back into line? Jerald Fishman Well, there are varying opinions of that. We just talked recently to our distributors about that, that have these very broad product portfolios and many customers and many suppliers. And there are some difference of opinion on that, amongst the distributors. There are -- on one end, some of them believe that it's mostly behind us and might have another couple of months to run. The other more pessimistic view is if I got 2 quarters to run. But nobody really knows for sure because the customers don't know for sure. So I'd say somewhere between a couple of months, probably at the outside, maybe one quarter or 2 quarters. [indiscernible] you synthesize all the comments from all of the distinct groups that we talked. One other qualifier would be, I think the most serious parts of that we've experienced. We saw a pretty rapid inventory reductions going on, almost coincident to the week that the commentary about supplies being available started coming out and all the panic came out of it. So I think the most significant reductions is the supply chain has sort of probably occurred and the rest of it for the next maybe a few months or worst case, another quarter or 2, are probably much less significant than the ones we've seen. Operator And the next question is from Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co This is Venk Nathamuni, in for Chris. A couple of questions. One, Jerry, you talked about inventory level of distribution, the plans for your -- for ADI to reduce that inventory level. But could you help quantify what the historical level of inventory is on average of distribution is, and where it is now and where do you expect it to be next quarter? David Zinsner This is Dave Zinsner, actually. So inventory, we measure it more or less by number of weeks. And inventory usually runs around 8 weeks. It's a little bit higher than that today by a couple of days. Our expectation is it will come down by a few days next quarter. Venkatesh Nathamuni - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co Okay, great. Thanks. And then given the significant sell-off in the stock, and the fact that you have considerable buyback authorization, what are your plans for continued buybacks and the quantum of buyback? David Zinsner Well, we have $1 billion buyback program that was authorized in December of last year. We've already purchased $200 million worth of ADI stock under that plan so we have $800 million left. I think you'll see as we have in the past, been committed to returning cash to shareholders both in the form of dividends that increase over time and buybacks. And you'll see examples of that commitment going forward. Jerald Fishman I think, I believe is pretty attractive. These questions were a bit -- it kind of yields and the expectations for the future, even though there's a lot of gyration going on and everyone is real nervous about the short term. Operator And the next question is from Terence Whalen with Citi. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc This one circles back against the industrial end market and some of the commentary you made there. I believe you said in some of your comments that the Chinese region within Industrial grew. I was wondering if you can give us more color around that and what gives you confidence that, that's not a continued stocking with the real demand. And also in your expectation, I think you mentioned in your baseline scenario, industrial would decline. Do you expect them to decline in a similar pace, down 5% sequentially or slighter than that or more heavily than that? Jerald Fishman Well, we don't know for sure because we never know about whether it's stockpiling in China or not. But there's not a lot of concerns right now about supply. So where there were a lot of concerns about supply, there was much more likelihood and opportunity to stockpile inventory. Although you'll only find out about the idea after the fact, so we really don't know for sure. I think the industrial environment in China is very robust. There's a huge amount of industrialization going on that continues in China, that's been growing at a pretty good rate for a while. And even in 2008 and 2009 when the world fell apart, our Industrial business in China kept growing. So I mean again, it's always difficult to predict the future but there's a lot of good signs on that business in China. What was the second question, I forgot? David Zinsner If you expect industrial to decline. Jerald Fishman I'd say our forecast right now, at least for the people that are running the Industrial business, we're expecting that to decline slightly, which is very typical in the fourth quarter because Europe slows down and Europe is a very large source of our Industrial business. But we don't expect, at least in the forecast, we now have, any significant decline, probably on lower decline than we have this quarter, in third -- in fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter. Terence Whalen - Citigroup Inc Okay, that's very helpful and then the quick follow up would be, you mentioned about lower factory loading. Could you remind us where utilization was maybe this quarter and what you might expect it to be next quarter? I believe last quarter you had said around 80%. David Zinsner Yes, so second quarter utilization was 80%. This quarter, it was -- third quarter, that was, it was 77%. We were expecting it to be kind of in the low 70s for the fourth quarter. And that's built into our gross margin assumption. Operator And the next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. I know you guys don't like to forecast 1 quarter ahead. But just curious if you could walk us through the logic a little bit about how we would think about the January quarter? Since you seem to have some unusual seasonal patterns here, typically, if the January quarter will be down a little bit, but since you had the 2 sort of sequential drops here for July and October, is it possible that, that could be more flattish to up, or would you still think that might be potentially down? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean we -- I'd have to say we really have no idea. My own personal opinion is that, we'll see more effects in the next couple of quarters that are based on what's going on in the economy and overall demand patterns than we will seasonal patterns that are considered to be normal. We look back and we always look back at the last couple of years, what's the seasonal pattern for the quarter. And I can report to you that our analysis indicated that we can't figure out what the seasonal patterns are. The only -- because there's so many different factors that go into each year, it seems lately, that those sort of more exogenous factors have more to do with -- than the typical seasonal factors. Less of our business is consumer than it used to be, so that might change the seasonal factors. More of our business is industrial and infrastructure, that might change the seasonal factors. So I just don't know enough that we'd look for sort of what the backlogs are, what customers are saying that we do, that we rely on long term going back 3, 4 years and trying to predict 1 quarter's growth relative to another. It's just too many other factors. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. And you mentioned a little bit about -- it looks like telecom might be up a little bit. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what's driving that in that sort of -- more of a something that happens, continuous to evolve over the next couple of quarters or that's just from some lumpiness? Any color would be helpful. Vincent Roche Well, I think in the third quarter, demand was generally strong across digital. And I think our sales were certainly crimped by the lack of supply to our largest customers. As a result of the tsunami in Japan, but what we're being told by our largest customers is that they're optimistic about the second half of the calendar year, and we are expecting to have good results in the fourth quarter and hopefully, in the first quarter as well. But I think overall, there's a very strong build out in China, particularly in the replacement of the GSM cycle, TD-SCDMA and particularly, in the developed world, the build out of LTE 4G is moving at a fair pace. Jerald Fishman Yes, I think the only way we can report is what the customers tell us. We have a very significant share in that business, particularly in the analog part of the buildup materials. And we have that share as the largest market shareholders, in the wireless business. So I think what Vincent said is what they're telling us. And that's why we believe that in the absence of real economic uncertainty accelerating, I mean that's what those customers believe. So we'll stop doing and see how that turns out. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc. If I could just slip a follow-up on that. Specific thoughts on the optical market, the build out of -- say, 40 to 100 gigabit per second infrastructure the slightly different infrastructure than anything else? Vincent Roche Well as you probably know, most of the -- in the optical build out is in the energy sector, the edge for 10G. So I think in terms of 40 gig, 100 gig, there are certainly technologies for the future but most of the action that we see is the 10 gig, and also to some extent, 2.5 gig. Jerald Fishman Mostly a bargain today. Vincent Roche Yes, certainly in terms of the volumes. But there's certainly a deployment of 40 gig, 100 gig in the core, but we're expecting -- in terms of volumes, we certainly expect 10 gig to be dominant. Operator And the next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Dave, I heard what you said earlier about inventory being down a couple days. Was that specific to your balance sheet or the distis or some combination of both? David Zinsner I would call it some combination of both. Basically, we're looking at inventory ballistically. But inventory on our balance sheet, the inventory at distribution. We know in aggregate they're going to be down, difficult to determine how much distributors will drop their inventory versus what we'll do with our inventory. But in aggregate, we expect inventory to be down. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I guess this question is a little tricky to ask clearly, so I hope I can pull this off. But if I look at how much inventory grew on the distributors' balance sheets this quarter, and then their guidance for their component sales to be down in the upcoming September quarter, do their orders on you -- are there orders on you consistent with that, if that's clear? Jerald Fishman Well, the orders on us have been weak during the third quarter. I don't think there's any doubt about that. Our conversations with the distributors, I mean they seem to indicate they want to get their inventories down. They haven't issued any massive directives at their product people to desecrate the inventories. But I think having said that, we've seen the orders from the distributors on Analog go down at a faster pace than the orders of our customers and our distributors, and that's indicative of the distributors going to reduce inventory. And that's -- we've been pretty cycled for -- I'm sorry to admit it, that part of 20 years, and that's what you typically see during these periods, where the distributors wake up and they say, \"Oh my god, I've got too much inventory,\" they start flushing it. And the customers, a little -- a lot less so than the distributor. Now why would you look at all these book-to-bill ratios, all these things that practically, every folks are trying to predict the future. In these kind of times, they're totally useless. Because unless you understand what's going on in the inventory, all that other stuff doesn't mean anything. And those numbers can change quickly on the other side as they do on the downside. So that's the best we can do on that, Jim. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. I appreciate that. If I could ask just one other one. How do you think about -- I heard what you said about utilization, Dave? How do you think about breaking that up between your internal wafer starts today? Are you going to favor internal wafer starts over outsourcing in order to keep utilization a little bit higher? How does that break down? David Zinsner We weren't really managing utilization to manage the inventory levels. To make them at an appropriate level to keep our lead time short but not build inventory that we're not going to need, we're going to have to throw away. Jerald Fishman A lot of the product we have, there's a small amount of products that are sizable between external foundries and our internal fabs. But mostly, the very fine line, seamless products, we don't build internally. So we don't have much of an ability or interest in sort of taking stuff that we're building, and TSMC and bringing it inside, although we have some abilities to do that. So as Dave said, we just manage the internal factories to the internal loads that we see from our customers on those things, and try to keep the inventory reasonably low but still be responsive just to get some upside. Because with all the doom and gloom out there right now, 1 month or 2 months from now, the world could think very differently about it. And the one thing we've learn from last cycle is you keep your lead times short. So we've managed the inventory, to keep the lead time short. Last quarter, a very interesting statistic is we shipped 99% of our revenues with less than the 4-week lead time. And that's what we intend to keep doing. And as the cost of that is a little bit extra inventory, fine, but we're not going to let the inventories run up because we'd like to get the upside when the orders go up. So I mean that's the complicated formula that we follow and that's the way we want the manufacturer reloaded. David Zinsner I think one of the other things that you might be -- part of this question is our gross margins of 65 to 66 are really good relative to where they may have been in other cycles where we've seen a decline in our revenue. And the reason is, we fundamentally have lowered the cost per unit of our product. And so if you look at 2008 even in our peak, we were generating 61% operating margins, we're generating for 400 to 500 basis points higher than that, because our cost per unit is actually fundamentally lower than that. Jerald Fishman A lot of the questions that we've gotten over the last couple of quarters have been -- is the things that we talked about, about the variability of the fixed cost structure and the lower levels of the variable cost structure and manufacturing. Are those real or just anomalies? And I think what we're beginning to see is what we have sort of thought all along that these are not fleeting cost reductions, and changes in expense format. They're lasting and when you can put the kind of results up that we put up this quarter, even though they were lower that we had thought when we had a pretty sudden and relatively unexpected decline in revenues, and we're expecting there's a wider variability on the numbers for next quarter, we're still expecting to earn very significant profits. I think that's the sign that the kind of things we've done are now part of the business model at ADI. Operator Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. One question on the margin guidance. Looks a little lighter than in recent prior quarters when you were at similar levels within your current guidance. So I'd point you to maybe Q2 or Q3 2010 or even Q1 of '11. Just wondering if you can give me some feeling for what's different from Q4 versus those prior quarters? Is it only the utilization levels, is it mix, is it pricing, is there something else? David Zinsner There's really nothing about price. Pricing has actually been improving. Mix maybe playing a factor in that, I'd have to go back and look at it. But I think the major difference is, we were in a cycle where we were building inventory on our balance sheet, or just collectively between the balance sheet of our balance sheet and our distributor's balance sheet. We're in the opposite situation this time, where we're looking to drop the aggregate inventory. And so utilization is down a little bit more than or meaningfully lower than where it had been at that point in time. So that's really the difference. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. That's helpful. And if I can ask a quick follow up. I know you said seasonality obviously is externally difficult. But if I were to just go to the exercise right now and roll out what I would view as typical seasonality on your Q4 guidance in the midpoint, I get for 2012 revenue growth, basically flat versus 2011. Do you think it's possible to get flat revenue growth next year versus this year? What sort of an economic environment would you think would be required potentially to see flat or maybe even -- flat revenue growth versus increase, versus declines for 2012? Jerald Fishman Well, I think we'd have to see a better, or more stable economic environment. I think that it's always very dangerous to try to project future quarters based on 1 or 2 quarters of inventory builds. We were on -- before the world came unglued here, both on the supply side and potentially, on the demand side next quarter, we were on a pretty good revenue build up. So I think for us at least, trying to go through this sequential quarters and come up with a real estimate for next year is very, very difficult right now. I mean we wouldn't have predicted the kind of quarter-to-quarter build ups we saw last year in couple of quarters. So I just don't know enough to make a prediction. But the one thing that I'm pretty confident about is if we get a fair shake in the market, we can outgrow the market as we have and we could, it would reach as well, I think you got to get most of our competitors, given the product mix we have with the momentum we have with the large customers. So we're going to have to wait and see. We're in a process right now of trying to put together our 2012 plan. It's certainly not lacking opportunities, our products and technical people have gone through it, and we're just trying to avoid right now, either reacting too strongly or too weekly to very large vicissitudes of changes in demand in the short term, based on factors that are not necessarily long term. So as we get closer, when we look at Q4 and we see where that turn out, we look at the order rates, and we look at the demand pattern, I think as we close out the year, we'll have a much more informed view of what's going to be possible for 2012 . Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. But if it's true that what we're seeing right now is primarily supply driven, and it turns out that the demand scenario was not terribly down, one, it would be reasonable to expect the revenue snap back at some point, once the supply issues are at work, is that correct? Jerald Fishman Yes, I think the major angst that we have about Q4 is, I think I mentioned in the opening remarks, much more about what's going to happen with demand than what could happen on the supply issue. Although, I think the supply issue, will probably still linger a little bit longer. But certainly, at a modulated rate for our last quarter. But mostly, I'm not trying to predict what's going to happen in the macro sense. And in that sense, you're probably smarter about that than we are. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc. Is it just the fact that you're getting very limited visibility from your customers that's basically driving the caution around the demand environment in Q4? Jerald Fishman I think -- I keep yelling at Vince, and our sales guy, \"Why can't you be more accurate?\" And their response is the customers don't know what's going to happen. And so I think what happens in companies with all these uncertainty, the wild gyrations go on in the stock market, and all the forecast of economic, who knows what's going to happen. I just think, customers can't predict what's going to happen, and therefore, the purchasing groups try to keep the vendors honest and sort of keep -- they don't tell me what's going to be bad until it's bad. And we try to look at that and judge it. But I think what's really the case is the customers just don't know what's going to happen in the short term with their business. Therefore, it's very hard for us to one-step out of the food chain for that to come up with a very warm opinion of what's going to happen next quarter then we have a lot of confidence, there's too many variables. We, at Analog, we have a very broad product line. We serve so many customers in so many markets in so many geographies in a stable market, so the lower large number is really helpful. But 1 is up, and 1 is down and everything is sort of evens out. And we're generally, pretty close to where our expectations are. But right now, it's just -- there's too many things moving in too many directions to be precise about. I wish I could be and I'm sure you'd like us to be, but when we look at ourselves in the mirror, we just don't know. Operator And the next question is from Parker Paulin with Wells Fargo. Parker Paulin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC A couple of questions, you kind of hit on shades of them, but I was curious as to your operating margins long term this quarter, and the last couple quarters, you've been up in the 35-plus percent range. And it looks like next quarter, you're kind of guiding a little bit below that. Do you think there's a range that's sustainable for you? Jerald Fishman Yes, I mean our sense, nothing that happened this quarter? We changed that view. We think with the mix of business we have, with the continuing pressure on the cost structure of the company, with continuing pricing power that we continue to enjoy in the market, we think that these kind of margins are quite stable going forward. And we think when the revenues are moving in the right direction, they can move above these lines. Parker Paulin - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC And second one, you've kind of hit on the sort of future outlook and a little higher overview, but I was just curious if we might be able to get any additional color in terms of the industrial breakout this quarter? Jerald Fishman Well, I think only what I said that the strength in the Industrial business was more of a factory automation, instrumentation side. The weakness seem to be more in the test equipment side, and we consider medical as part of the Industrial part of the business. But as I said earlier, it's not -- these aren't large differences, but they are minor differences but nevertheless, different. Operator And the next question is from Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research So on the, I assume it was below 1 but was book-to-bill below 1 in the quarter? Jerald Fishman Yes. But as I said earlier, I wouldn't think one thing or the other as a result of that. The inventories are being liquidated. So it's interesting but mostly irrelevant statistics. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research But we like to track those kind of things anyway. Jerald Fishman I know you do, but we try to do but our predictability of using that as an indicator of our next quarter sales as we found out this quarter, when book-to-bill was well above 1 last quarter, at least for us, it's not very enlightening. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research Understood. And there's just a couple of smaller ones. Have you noticed any overall change in your mix in the last month or in the last few weeks where people are trying or buying the lower end SKUs? And then the other question was on the consumer area that was less than expected, what application area was that? Jerald Fishman Well, we're not seeing any real differences. I mean customers buy what they're selling. And the product they have was selling, we said not that we have very many low-end products, but generally, I don't think there's anything that is noteworthy about the kind of products that people are buying. Our average selling prices, which were represented into the mix were relatively constant. So I don't think there's any -- anything really noteworthy on that. The second question, specific to consumer was it, Shawn? Yes, I think it's -- there's a broad range of consumer products that in second quarter, went down a lot of the -- we covered a little bit for Q3. The backlogs went up a little bit, so maybe we'll recover a little bit more in Q4 in line with normal seasonality, back-to-school, all that kind of stuff. But walk away and see how that happens, there wasn't any one particular application. Operator And the next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. Dave, accounting question for you. Utilization is coming down this quarter. I think you said into the low 70% range. Did that fully get reflected in gross margins? Or is it still in October because you have to sell the inventory? David Zinsner Usually when the variance kind of go negative, that in generally it just goes right through the P&amp;L. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. So is it fair to say that if October is the bottom for revenues, that it's also probably the bottom for gross margin? David Zinsner Yes. Obviously, it depends on what the aggregate inventory levels are going to do in the following quarter. But if the following quarter, they stabilize or moving up because revenues increasing, then I think you could say that, that's the trough. Operator And the next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc. I'm just wondering, when you look at your inventory levels in-house, any 2 of your sheet that you need to -- working down a little bit? I know there's a couple of questions already on it, but I just wanted to get your thoughts there. David Zinsner So the question is whether the inventory levels on our balance sheet need to come down, is that what the question is? Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc. Yes. David Zinsner Yes, I think we always take a look at this in aggregate. We certainly had 110 days of inventory or at the kind of high end of our range. So we are over time, probably looking to bring those down more closer to 100 days. But we're just -- as a process in near term, you look at the aggregate inventory between what we have on our balance sheet, what the distributors have on their balance sheet, and we look to try to in aggregate, bring those down. Jerald Fishman I think it's also true that, we in the past, have carried much larger inventory than that. And we rarely have write-downs for those inventories. Because particularly, the internal products we built have such long life cycle. And the reason I was trying to keep the inventories lower than the peak levels that we've had in the past, just for the reason of the first \"question\" that just got asked, we have found that it's much better for us to have a much more rapid snapback in the gross margins than try to preserve another point or so of gross margins by keeping the factories overloaded. And we really run the company around the lead times. So we're going to make sure that the lead times stay low and that's going to absorb the inventory rather than the other way around. Vijay Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc. Okay and on the industrial, sir, I know you mentioned, things are still looking pretty stable. What's your book-to-bill there as you look on? I know it's not been a good indicator, but what do you see the book-to-bill there on industrial side? Jerald Fishman I don't have that data. We don't break it down by industry segment. I'm sorry we don't have that data. Operator And the next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG Jerry, you mentioned in your prepared comments, that you missed some revenue opportunity in the July quarter out of the COGS infrastructure business. Jerald Fishman Yes. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG Component shortage of wafers. I'm kind of curious, how much was that and do you expect to make that back in the October quarter? Jerald Fishman The first answer is simpler than the second one. The first answer was probably 40% of the revenue miss. And I think over time, you'll make that back and over time's what happens with the ultimate demand from those customers. But it was a fairly significant number. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG Jerry was that 40% of the low end of guide or to the midpoint? Jerald Fishman To the midpoint. David Zinsner Yes, to the midpoint. John Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG And then guys when you look at the midpoint of guidance for the October quarter, can you help me understand what normal linearity is for this quarter, and does the midpoint assume normal linearity? Or do you expect that you're not going to see what I would expect to be relatively stronger months in September and October? Jerald Fishman Typically, I think Dave alluded to this earlier. We see August being relatively weak, particularly in Europe. And then we see a stronger September and a much longer October. That's typically the linearity of the quarter and that's the linearity that we're planning on for this quarter. Operator And the final question is from David Wu with Indaba Global Research. David Wu - Global Crown Jerry, a quick question on geography. If I were to look at your business, Europe, Western Europe, United States and Japan, if you add up those 3  up, how much of that business would it be and correspondingly, what about those \"merchant markets,\" how big are those in terms of your total revenue mix? Jerald Fishman I will delegate that to David who has all the numbers. David Zinsner It's David, I'm sorry. I missed what you said. What were the components of the one you wanted... David Wu - Global Crown Well, U.S., Europe, Western Europe and Japan. Can you give any idea what percentage of the business that is? And if you look at the BRIC countries, the Brazil, Indias and Chinas, how big could that be? David Zinsner Okay so basically about 50% -- if I mention this correctly, but 50% of our revenue came from the U.S. and Europe and the rest of North America. If you add Japan, that's another 13% and the rest of China and Asia Pac. Mindy Kohl Okay. That concludes our Q&amp;A session.

Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking information that is provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the day of the live broadcast, which is February 15, 2011. With that, I'll turn it over to our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerald Fishman Well, good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on the first quarter conference call. The first quarter for ADI was another very good quarter across virtually every dimension. Despite fears of a possible very significant inventory correction and the continued economic uncertainty in many regions of the world, our revenue for the first quarter was at the levels that we had predicted three months ago, and the trends within each end market were mostly also right on target. Specifically, our revenues in the first quarter were $729 million, which were up 21% year-over-year and down about 5% sequentially, which was slightly above the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. Our order trends during the quarter were very typical of what we experienced in the first fiscal quarter of our fiscal years. We saw some weakness in late November and December, consistent with the holiday-related shutdowns of our customers and also, of course, some inventory reductions, which was followed by a strong January. For the quarter, our book-to-bill ratio was approximately one, and our backlog increased slightly entering the second quarter. In addition, the order levels from our OEM customers increased from fourth quarter levels indicating that business conditions are stabilizing and in some cases improving. Clearly, we did not see this significant inventory correction at ADI that we all feared. We believe this was a direct result of our manufacturing strategy, which kept lead times short through the entire cycle and kept inventory levels at our distributors within historical norms. Customers were confident in our ability to deliver and as a result, there was little excess inventory in the supply chain. In addition, feedback from many of our largest customers indicates that they are optimistic about their business going forward, and their inventories appear to be in good control. Those comments in the recent order trend that we've seen provide us some comfort that we can achieve sequential revenue growth in the second fiscal quarter and hopefully, we can continue to see strength for the balance of the year. So now I'll turn the call over to Dave, who is going to provide you some more details about our financial results. David Zinsner Thanks, Jerry. As Jerry mentioned, first quarter revenues were $729 million, declining 5% sequentially, but increasing 21% from last year. Gross margins were slightly above guidance at 66.2% in the first quarter, compared to 67% in the prior quarter. Gross margins declined modestly as a result of lower levels of production at our internal fabs and a slightly unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses for the first quarter were $223 million, and that was an $8 million or 3.4% sequential decline from the prior quarter. In the first quarter, we benefited from our lower and more variable operating expense structure and in particular, from lower variable compensation payments versus the fourth quarter. Our operating margins held up very well despite the sequential revenue decline. Operating profits for the first quarter were $259 million or 35.6% of sales, down only slightly from our record 37.1% of sales in the prior quarter and a result of continued strength in gross margins and lower operating expenses. Other expenses was approximately $600,000, and that was compared to $2.3 million of other income in the prior quarter. The decrease was the result of having recorded a one-time gain on the sale of some unused real estate in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate for continuing operations was 16.7% this quarter versus 21.9% in the prior quarter. The decline was due to a few one-time tax benefit items, including the reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit for calendar year 2010. Excluding these tax-related benefit items, our tax rate was 21.7%, and we expect that will continue for the remainder of 2011. Our weighted average share count was 309 million shares. We repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares or $114 million of ADI stock this quarter. However, the share count increased in the quarter as a result of the higher stock price and our stock option exercise activity being a little bit more robust than usual. Going forward, we anticipate that we will continue to be active buyers of ADI stock. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.70 compared to $0.73 in the prior quarter. Excluding one-time tax benefit items, non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.66. Diluted EPS from the gain on the sale of discontinued operations was $0.02 at the time of the sale of the cellular handset radio and baseband chipset business to MediaTek in the first fiscal quarter of 2008. We placed $10 million of the sale proceeds in escrow. These funds were released to ADI in the first quarter of 2011 and as a result, in Q1, we had a gain from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $6.5 million or $0.02 per share. Our cash generation continue to be strong as we generated 30% of our revenue or $217 million in operating cash flow, and our cash balance is now approximately $3 billion versus $2.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Net cash at the end of the first quarter was approximately $2.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $26 million, and that resulted in free cash flow of $191 million or 26% of revenue for the quarter. Our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per outstanding share of common stock that will be paid on March 23, 2011, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2011. Our accounts receivable balance decreased sequentially by approximately 1%, and our days sales outstanding increased by two days to 48 days in the first quarter. All of our customers are current to their terms. In anticipation of a stronger second quarter, inventory on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter increased by 2% compared to the immediately prior quarter, and our days of inventory were 105 days. Our distributor inventory also increased by 2% in anticipation of a stronger quarter for the second quarter. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remain similar to last quarter and are in good control, with 98% of our shipments to OEMs occurring within six weeks and 99% within eight weeks. All in all, the quarter was right on plan across virtually every operating metric. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, who will discuss the results from each of our end markets and provide our short-term outlook. Jerald Fishman Well, with regard to our market segment performance in the first quarter, I'll first talk about the industrial market. For the first quarter, our revenues from the very broad and diversified industrial market, which is 46% of our total revenues, declined 3% sequentially to $337 million, which is very much in line with typical seasonal patterns we see in our first quarter. In the industrial market, where we sell literally thousands of products to tens of thousands of customers, and our technology is often a differentiator in our customers end products. We believe that ADI continues to have an excellent opportunity to be the leading supplier in each of the application areas that we serve in the industrial market. Driven by our customers needs for increased energy efficiency, industrial automation and advanced instrumentation, we're seeing demand for ADI's high-performance signal processing technology not only in the newer areas such as energy and building automation, but also with more traditional I&amp;I application areas. We're also seeing growth opportunities in the Asian markets as customers build out factory automation infrastructure, social infrastructure and energy management systems. And we expect that this trend will continue to drive our growth in industrial revenues for ADI. Overall, we believe that the industrial market offers strong growth opportunities for ADI, and we expect it will resume sequential growth in our second fiscal quarter, a prediction that is supported by seasonal patterns as well as by leading industrial customers, who have reported to us that they believe that the underlying conditions in their markets are solid. Within the industrial category, healthcare presents an extremely strong growth opportunity for ADI. During the first quarter, healthcare revenues actually increased sequentially as a result of our significant new product portfolio and competitive strength in imaging and patient monitoring and in instrumentation applications. In addition, we believe that healthcare sales are benefiting to some degree from the pent-up demand that goes up during the credit crisis when capital spending was severely reduced. We expect continued growth in the healthcare revenues in Q2 and solid expansion through the year as our strategic customers are optimistic about their growth prospects for 2011. Overall, we expect the number of trends to continue to increase demand for ADI technology in the healthcare market. Among these are an increasing need for higher speed and channel count in medical imaging systems to improve image resolution and throughput while achieving a lower cost per channel; to drive for improved measurement performance to increase diagnostic accuracy; the expansion of telemedicine and the requirements for portability as well as the inclusion of secured communications capabilities in healthcare application; and finally, the requirements for patient safety and system reliability. Revenues from our automotive customers were approximately $95 million in Q1, an increase of approximately 1% from Q4. This was a record for our Automotive business. Q1 marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which we've grown our Automotive business, and with our annual run rate now approaching $400 million, we're now deriving 13% of our total revenues from the automotive market. Leveraging our strength, along the signal chain in centers with signal conditioning, data converters and DSPs, ADI has developed a very compelling product portfolio in the areas of safety, infotainment and powertrain applications. This portfolio, along with a much more robust automotive market, continues to drive our automotive success. We expect continued growth in automotive revenues in our second quarter and believe that we'll continue to benefit from favorable macro trends within the automotive space in the areas of active and passive safety, of fuel efficiency and convenience, all of which drive higher dollar content for ADI. As an example, our very sophisticated lithium-ion battery monitoring products for both hybrid and electric vehicles are achieving expanding market penetration. We expect that these applications will present a particularly attractive opportunity for ADI due to the very complex nature of the signal processing challenge and the anticipated unit growth of hybrid and electric vehicles. In summary, the automotive market continues to represent an attractive growth opportunity for ADI as we have the momentum from both an increasing build of material value for vehicle and also increasing market share for ADI. Communications revenues, at $163 million in the first quarter, were down 8% versus our Q4 levels and accounted for 22% of our total sales in Q1. Wireless infrastructure sales declined as expected and were reflective of the completion of the TD-SCDMA Phase 4 rollout in China. This was partially offset by good strength in North America and Europe as a result of significant bandwidth enhancements being deployed in these regions. In addition, in Q1, our sales of wired infrastructure products grew sequentially as the build out of fixed networks continue to increase in response to the data communications demand being generated by mobile networks. In the short term, we expect our communications revenues to be flat to up slightly in Q2, with continuing strength in North America and Europe, offset by ongoing weakness in China-based deployments. However, by the second half of our fiscal year, we expect the next phase of deployments in China to begin, which should reaccelerate our growth in this segment. Over the longer term, we expect that communications infrastructure will remain a key area of opportunity for ADI. Just recently, one of our major customers, Ericsson, described mobile subscriber growth as a very key driver for wireless infrastructure capital spending, estimating that the number of global broadband subscriptions will reach 1 billion this year and top 3.8 billion by 2015. In addition, the ever increasing need for higher bandwidth to support the dramatic increases in video demand pushes this need even further. Going forward, the need for higher performance radios to support multiple communication standards, higher density of channels to support increased data payloads, new form factors in hard-to-reach places, improved power efficiency, smaller footprints and lower cost per channel are all the trends that we anticipate will drive growth for ADI and help us to continue to build on our leadership position in the communications market. Consumer revenues, while exceeding our very conservative internal plan that we had for Q1, were down approximately 12% sequentially primarily due to seasonality and overall weak consumer spending. In Q1, revenues from consumer customers were $121 million and accounted for 17% of our total revenues. We are currently expecting a lift of consumer revenues in Q2 above our Q1 levels basically from applications for cameras and home entertainment products, which are entering a historically stronger seasonal period in Q2 compared to Q1. We also continue to be very well positioned in a few niche consumer applications in the portable space and in the gaming area. Overall, we're planning for our consumer revenues to grow in the second quarter. And finally, our computing revenues were down 4% sequentially, representing just 2% of our total revenues. As I'm sure you're aware, the computing market is not a space where ADI is applying R&amp;D resource. On a regional basis, our revenues declined sequentially in all regions in Q1, in line with our original expectations. So now let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2011 and make a few comments about the longer term. Based on the stabilization in orders that we saw in the first quarter and positive feedback across our customer base, we are planning for revenue growth to resume in the second quarter. Specifically, we're planning for our second quarter revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million, which is approximately flat to up 4% sequentially, and up 9% to 14% on a year-over-year basis. We're also planning for our gross margins to increase slightly to approximately 66.5% of sales based on the current mix assumptions that are built into our plan, and for our operating expenses to grow a few percent sequentially, primarily as a result of annual salary increases, which took effect at the beginning of the second quarter. For the balance of the year, we're planning for our expenses to grow slower than our revenues. On an earnings per share basis, we anticipate that our diluted earnings per share from our continuing operations for the quarter will be in the range of $0.65 to $0.69. Looking out further than the second quarter, we remain very confident about the long-term prospects for ADI. We've been operating under a new organizational structure, which divides the business into market segments and technology groups now for more than a year. We believe this model has enhanced our understanding of critical applications technology and customer needs and will continue to make us more effective in developing products that will push the envelope of signal processing technology. Most recently, we also embarked on a new initiative inside ADI to improve the effectiveness of our new product development spending. We believe that through this process, we'll drive more growth out of the R&amp;D dollars that we're currently investing within ADI. As a result of our strong product portfolio and many of these new initiatives to enhance the productivity of our investments, we believe that our objective to grow our revenues long term in the range of 8% to 12% that we communicated well over a year ago is both realistic and achievable. We've also fundamentally adjusted our cost structure to drive more profitability, and we made our model much more variable than historically, which allows our profits to be much more reactive to changes in revenues. We've already seen the benefits of this approach in our first quarter results, where operating margins were above 35% despite a 5% sequential revenue decline. The end result, we now believe, is a business that achieves very solid growth and very attractive margins and drives very significant free cash flow and ultimately, very good returns for our stockholders. Mindy Kohl Thank you, Jerry. During today's Q&amp;A period, please limit yourself to one primary question and no more than one follow-on question. We'll give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we're now ready for questions.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Jerry, let me just ask you, the year seems to have started very well for ADI with year-on-year revenue growth now at 20.8%. As we look through the rest of the year, within the context of your guidance of 8% to 12% as kind of the longer term target, what areas do you think will be the strongest growing for you through the rest of this year? I know if you recall, the light comm [ph] equipment and automotive. But if I to look through your business, what area do you think we should be looking at maybe as a strength and areas that may will worry a little bit in terms of the outlook? Jerald Fishman Well, I think overall, the industrial market continues to represent one of the best opportunities for ADI. This is no longer a stodgy 3% growth business. This is a business that grew strongly last year and the year before, and in fact, over the last three or four years. There are many, many segments within industrial that are growing very quickly. The fact that even after the very significant growth that we had in industrial products in 2010, that we actually only declined 3% in Q1, which is seasonally a very weak quarter because there's less days in distribution and so on. To us, it's a very good sign that -- it's not that that business is going to grow 35% a year or like whatever up there [ph] we grew last year. But that's a solid growth for us. And I expect that if the economies tend to hold and at the pace they are being made, I think the Industrial business will be a very strong business for us. We've talked at some length about the Automotive business. That business has been one of the higher growth businesses for us as the portfolio keeps getting richer across applications in cars that tend to be in very high demand right now. So I think that business should be strong through the year. The Communications business has really been a mixed picture with the infrastructure in China being weaker in the first half. But the feedback we get is that's going to strengthen. And certainly, the wired part of our Communications business, which is much more dependent on penetration than the end equipment sales right now, should also grow. Now probably the remaining largest I've known is what happens in the Consumer businesses. And we have strong positions, but ultimately, that will be dependent on what consumers actually do. So that's about the best information we have about the rest of the year based on what we know right now. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank Jerry, any sense of where -- I know you said the inventory correction is behind us and that you've seen some pickup in OEM orders... Jerald Fishman I said I believe it's behind us. Uche Orji - UBS Investment Bank You believe it's behind you, absolutely. In terms of what we're seeing with distributors, any comment as to where the level of inventory is now related to historical levels and in terms of order stabilization? I believe the comments you made applies to both disti [distribution] and to OEMs. I just want to clarify that. David Zinsner So answering your second question, Uche, yes, the stabilization of the order pattern happened in both the disti and OEM space. The disti inventory continues to look to be in pretty good shape, and their days of inventory are running kind of in the eight weeks that they normally target. Its only up a couple percent from last quarter really just gearing up for what we believe will be a stronger second quarter. Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Roughly what percentage of your revenues come from product made of foundries versus internally? And can you give us some idea as to the difference in gross margin between foundry and internally sourced product? David Zinsner It's roughly 50-50. About 50% of our revenue was derived from products manufactured internally, 50% externally. Gross margins are a little bit higher, obviously, internally. But that has more to do with the mix of products that we produce internally. It tends to be more geared to industrial products that tends to be our highest gross margin products in the company. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen. [Citigroup] Bin Jiang This is Bin speaking for Terence. My first question, I have a quick follow-up on the healthcare, and you comment a lot of opportunity in the healthcare. Can you give us some perspective how much growth you think will happen? And how much percentage healthcare account for as a percentage of total sales? Jerald Fishman Sorry. There's a lot of noise on that. I couldn't hear the second half of your question? Bin Jiang Second half, how much is healthcare account for the total percentage of sales? David Zinsner Percent of revenue. It's roughly in the mid single digits as a percent of total. And what was the first part of the question? Bin Jiang So what growth rates do you expect for healthcare for the full year fiscal 2011? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, we don't really make predictions by market segments here. It's just we don't have enough data to be accurate about it. But I think it's fair to say that when we look at the plans for that business for this year, we expect that to be a pretty good grower for us, both in an absolute sense and relative to many other products. Bin Jiang My second question is on CapEx. So CapEx in the first quarter was down from the fourth quarter last year. Do you expect deceleration of CapEx for the year 2011, or it could be fairly flat at $25 million or $26 million? David Zinsner It's going to run around this range. We roughly target CapEx to be somewhere in the 3% to 4% of revenue. I suspect every quarter, we'll run somewhere in that range. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co Can you just talk about what the utilization rates are right now, and where those are going and what your inventory plans are? David Zinsner So utilization for first quarter was up 75%. That was down from about 80% in the prior quarter. We're expecting it, obviously, to pick up as we expect revenues to be up in the second quarter. I'd say it will be up a few percentage points. On the inventory side, we took inventories up to 105 days, also in anticipation of a stronger second quarter. Our goal is really to kind of keep it in the 100-day range. So we're going to try to target bringing the days of inventory back down, closer to 100 over the course of this year. Christopher Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co And as my follow up, can you just talk about the various gross margin drivers going forward? David Zinsner Sure. I mean, I think the primary driver is going to be, obviously, utilization and revenue growth. As we grow sales, we will obviously be increasing production. Also, we have an amount of fixed expense within the cost of sales that when sales increase, that's beneficial to the gross margins. I think that's the biggest single driver for gross margins going forward. Obviously, from quarter-to-quarter, the mix will certainly impact it. But mix tends to be a fairly minor driver of gross margins. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. This is Kate Kotlarsky for Jim Covello. Wanted to dig a little bit into the automotive part of the business. Clearly, that's doing very well now, and I was hoping you can talk a little bit about what you're expecting for the business throughout the course of the year and maybe talk about it from a geographic perspective. I know that China is one area that's been doing very well. Maybe you can comment kind of as you move through the year what geographies you expect to be contributing more meaningfully to the business. Jerald Fishman Well, think it's really a combination of each location. We typically sell to the OEMs that build systems for companies. So if you look at the largest automotive suppliers for the large OEMs, the geography gets a little confusing because you have OEMs that are in Europe that supplies both Europe and America and other places, even China in some cases. So the geographic part isn't the most relevant part given that each of our suppliers has a worldwide business. But I would say that in aggregate, most of our OEMs that we sell to in the Automotive business are enthusiastic about the balance of the year. The volumes they are seeing are good, the desire for more electronics and more safety features, and we're selling parts that go into stability control systems, which are becoming part of legislation in many locations. So I mean, we're enthusiastic about that business. I can't quote you a growth rate and what's going to happen in any particular quarter and particularly those in the far future. But this business has become a good business for us. It's up there at $90 million or $100 million a quarter. It's been growing. We have good customers. And those programs with automotive manufacturers tend to be ones that take a long time to get. Once you get them, you keep them, unless you really screw it up. And we have a very good reputation with automotive customers, not only for the quality of our technology, but also the long-term reliability of our product, which is really important to those guys. So in automotive, we're continuing to put money into it. We're continuing to build the internal systems in the company to be a great supplier to the automotive customers. And so it's like anything else to Analog, it's not the only thing, and I can't even say it's the most important thing. But it's one of the drivers that we've been doing well at, and we think we'll continue to do well at. Kate Kotlarsky - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. If we were to think about it from a content perspective and how your content at your customers in the Automotive segment has changed over time, where are we today in terms of your content? And do you have an expectation of where we might be a year from now? Jerald Fishman Well, it's hard to put a dollar number per car on this thing if that's what you're after. But our penetration in the automotive market, if you go back five, six, seven years ago, it was mostly airbag sensors. And we were a very important and high market shareholder, still are today, on airbag sensors and micromachine accelerometers. So I think our business in automotive has really expanded in a couple of different dimensions. Firstly, we're continuing to do all the safety stuff. We have a large business supply in automotive accelerometers. We also now are supplying micromachine gyroscopes for stability control applications and many other safety applications in cars. But also, as I mentioned in the opening comments, we're supplying a lot of parts into engine management. We're supplying battery management. We're supplying a lot of our DSPs that go into some of the high-end entertainment systems. So it's really a combination of sensors that just make a car run better to things that actually save energy to things that sound good to things that hopefully, save a lot of lives. There's a lot of people now on the stability control application, I believe, that stability control is more important than crash sensors because more people die when the car tips over and crashes into somebody. So that's really an emerging market for semiconductor sensors, and I think our gyroscope is a pretty good product in there. So I think it's in many, many different dimensions, but it's very hard to put a specific dollar content on it. But it's quite a bit many multiples of what it used to be. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tim Luke with Barclays Capital. Sameer Kalucha This is Sameer Kalucha calling in for Tim Luke. I just wanted to get a sense of the comm infrastructure space. I just wanted to get a feel of how is the contribution from China, North America and Europe relative to each other? And how do you see India 3G contributing to this growth going forward? Jerald Fishman Well, again, you have to be a little careful on where the parts are board and where the parts are shipped. I think the amount of sales we have in China is not a huge amount of our sales in infrastructure despite common belief that that's the predominant part of our business. It's not today. But I tell you that a lot of -- and even within that sector or geography, a lot of products that are built by the Chinese base station manufacturers are shipped outside of China. So the geographies are a little confusing on that. I think our business is very well balanced between China, the U.S., Europe. And I think that's why even when the TD-SCDMA application goes a little cold for a couple of quarters, our Communications business still stays very strong. Sameer Kalucha And maybe a little follow-up on that. In terms of LTE, how is the deployment you're seeing out there? And I wonder, how does LTE impact the Comm results for you going forward? And does it drive back better ASPs, better volumes? Jerald Fishman I mean, each standard, as they get better, takes higher and more signal processing content. So that business is certainly not sort of a stable business. Each generation, when it went from 2G to 3G and 3G to 4G and to any other standard that comes along, the speeds are higher, the density is higher and that requires higher performance products. So I think all those trends tend to be very favorable for us. Sameer Kalucha And the ASP difference between 3G and LTE for... Jerald Fishman It varies widely by how many radio cards actually were in every system. That's more the driver of that and the particular ASP. We get in any particular card because the configurations are so different. So I can't really give you a firm number on that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with Caris &amp; Company. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Jerry, as you look at the potential for 8% to 12% growth this year, what are the key swing factors that would bring you in more towards the lower end of that range versus the higher end of that range? Jerald Fishman Well, it's all the things everybody fears and hopes for, on either side of that question. There's always concerns that, yes, there's still more inventory out there and what we're seeing isnt real. That's certainly not our belief now, but that can certainly be the case. And we could see a complete collapse of consumer spending. We could see interest rates going up and people starting to cut back on capital spending. I mean, there's a long list of bogeymen out there that we worry about a lot. On the other hand, that's certainly not what our customers are telling us. So it depends on whether you want to be enthusiastic or pessimistic about it, but we just look at the trends. We listen carefully to what the customers are telling us. We had very good feedback from the largest customers in each of the segments that we serve. Amazingly, in Q1, the numbers, with all the complicated things that were going on and all the conflicting signals out there, I mean, we came in right down the middle, not only on the total, but within the segment, so it was pretty close. So we don't know any more than that. We just know. We follow the trends. We look very close to large customers. And we integrate all that, come up with a number for next quarter, and that's about all we can do. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company And then you had mentioned that the company's implementing a new approach to looking at and tracking new product efficacy. Can you talk about when you'd expect that new approach to start to yield some payouts that investors would be able to recognize? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, the real challenge for us is ADI spends about $500 million a year in R&amp;D. If you can get more output for every dollar of input, it's very profitable and it'd be very appealing to investors. So we've been working not so much on the creative part of that, which is always something we work on. But there's a lot of systematic parts to getting new products out. And there is, like in every company, we have some that sell and some that don't. And there's always the challenge of figuring out those in advance rather than after the fact. So I think we are looking at each of the businesses very carefully. We're looking where the productivity in the R&amp;D is the highest. We're trying to emulate the practices in those businesses in the parts where the R&amp;D productivity has not been good. And we're trying to make changes to reflect the best practices in the company. But certainly, early on the best way you can do that is really understand where it is, that the productivity is the highest and where it isn't and how do you fix the places that aren't and make them look like the places that are. So I don't think there's anything magical here. It's just when we look forward, one of the greatest opportunities for sales growth in Analog is getting more productivity out of the R&amp;D we're spending. We're spending plenty of money on R&amp;D, and we're getting good results out of it. And the payback, obviously, with the margins we're running is pretty good. But I think it could be better, and we're going to work hard to get there. Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company And is that one of the things that gives you confidence that you can keep expense growth growing noticeably slower than revenue growth? Jerald Fishman Yes, that's certainly the way we're going to get there. I mean, it's easy to quote those statistics and say, \"Well, we're going to grow sales higher than expected.\" But we don't like to say that until we got to be to how we're going to do that. Much the same way as, when we said we're going to get the margins of the business up and everybody asked lightly, is that just the usual CEO stuff and CFO stuff. You really got some ideas how to do it? And we said we wouldn't have said it if we didnt have ideas, and we wouldn't talk about the sales growth rate if we didn't have some ideas on how to get there. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates First question was just on how we should think about seasonality ahead of a pretty decent guide at least relative to expectations here. Can we still expect to get your sort of sequential growth in the following couple of quarters given the strength in this quarter? To mean, was this quarter unusual, or should we sort of expect the usual going forward? Jerald Fishman Well, I mean, we'll just have to wait and see. I mean, nobody has really a phenomenal visibility into what happens six months or nine months or a year from now. So everyone just has guesses. Certainly, that's what we hope would happen, and there are reasons to believe it might happen. But we're struggling to get the numbers right for next quarter first. That's our most important thing, and to plan the company around a set of numbers that we can meet. And so when you look out further than that, it's really just speculation at this point. So I think we'll have to all sit around and hold our breath and wait and see what happens this quarter, and then we'll give you a sense of what's likely to happen sort of after that. Jonathan Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates And as my follow up, Jerry, maybe you could talk a little bit about the design win process on the Auto business? Are you finding that when you go in, you're pretty much dominating a bigger set of sockets where you maybe, for example, maybe have your gyroscope and you're pretty much always winning 100% of that business? Or is the competitive landscape such that you'll win some, but there'll be a second source and then in the next platform, you'll sort of switch with that competitor? Just go through that a little bit. Jerald Fishman Sure. Well, I think it's much more a design-sensitive business with long product life cycles than, let's say, some of the other applications and consumer products who spend that much faster design cycles. So we approach the Automotive business with a mentality that says, \"If we can do something nobody else can do and do it better and do it at pretty good margins, then that's a good business for us.\" And if we're going to be in the Automotive business, we'd need two [ph] products that there's four people and then they line them up against the wall and they take the lowest price, long term, that's not going to be a great business for us. It may be a great business for the companies. So we're really trying to push the technology window and provide very innovative technology at a reasonable price to customers and not focus on applications that every six months or a year are out for bid. And we've been successful doing that. If we do a good job for the customers, I think they'll stick with us in that business. And if we don't, they'll look for alternatives. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman with Gleacher &amp; Company. Doug Freedman - Gleacher &amp; Company, Inc. If I could sort of focus a little bit more on the near term and what you're seeing in terms of booking profiles, what type of visibility are customers willing to give you, and what are you feeling like your channel partners are willing to say and do as far as carrying inventory now and going forward for the balance of the year? Jerald Fishman Well, with our channel partners, as I think we've mentioned in the past, we tend to set their inventory levels more than they do. We listen very respectfully to what they want, and then we look at what they're going to sell through. And that's how we provide inventory towards and that's how we've done it through both the up and the down cycle. As far as large customers go, they give us a forecast. Some of our customers, we ship into a warehouse and they pull out from that warehouse. But we get those numbers very frequently, and we keep a pretty good balance on that. Generally, the conversion rates that we see from the large OEM customers that pull from hubs or central [ph] inventory points, is actually very good. So we usually have a pretty good beat on what our OEM customers' going to take for the quarter. I don't know if that helps you, but that's the best I can do. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research First one, just on the OpEx. Will your variable compensation program be the only driver of any OpEx increase through the back half of the year, so in Q3 and Q4? Or do you anticipate any further investments in OpEx beyond what the variable comp program would drive? Jerald Fishman Well, I think as long as revenues keep growing, which we'll have to wait and see how that goes, we are making strategic hires in various parts of the business. So I don't think it will be the only driver, but it'll be one driver and the one that reacts the quickest to what happens. But we keep a very tight fist on hiring new people, but we're in some very exciting growth businesses. We got to put some more resource into some of the businesses. We tend to balance that out with other business that we put less resource in. But I think in aggregate, if business stays strong, we'll probably do some hiring as we did last quarter in some of the most important businesses we have. But on the other hand, we've got a pretty good hammer on making sure it doesn't run away with us, and it keeps under very tight control because we are still, I believe, we got more leverage out of us. Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research And one question on your gross margin, specifically your incremental gross margin. So I think in maybe 10 years or so before the downturn hit at least, I think your incremental gross margin was about 65%. Meaning, about $0.65 on average of every incremental dollar revenue that you earned or lost fell to the gross margin line. At this point, given the structural improvements that you've made in your gross margin, do you have a feeling for how much higher your incremental gross margin might be now versus where it was maybe a couple of years ago? Jerald Fishman I'll turn it over to our erstwhile CFO. David Zinsner Well, it's a difficult question to answer only because half our business comes from products manufactured mostly externally. And so we don't get a lot of incremental lift for increased revenue on those parts of our business. But obviously, in the internal side, we do get a fair amount of incremental margin when production revenues increased. So it's certainly higher than the 66% or thereabouts gross margins we're running on the incremental basis to be close to 80% probably on average. Certainly, on products that are higher than that and if the mix is higher towards internal, then it would be higher than that. If the mix is more towards the external, then it would obviously be lower than that. Jerald Fishman Obviously, when the Industrial business grows the fastest, that's when we get our highest incremental gross margins. Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research Do you think it's not in line to think that $0.80 of every $1 that you've earned in revenue growth could potentially fall to your gross margin line? David Zinsner That's a rough order of magnitude, but obviously, it's mix dependent. Operator Your final question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research I was wondering if you guys could -- if you have a sense of where you think you're getting the most design traction and winning share in terms of component categories and end markets? And then I have a follow-up. Jerald Fishman I would say that there's no one area in product or one area in markets that really sticks out. I think we have good design traction in all the market segments that we're investing in. We stopped putting R&amp;D into the Computer business, so I would say we're getting a ton of design wins there. But we're putting in the R&amp;D, our traction is very good across all the market segments and certainly, most of the product segments. Shawn Webster - Macquarie Research And then can you give us a sense of where your turns are versus history for your last quarter and what you're expecting for this quarter? David Zinsner Again, that's a number that's difficult to quantify given that half our backlog or more than half our backlog is from disti, and we don't obviously recognize revenue when we ship. But if you kind of did a back-of-the-napkin analysis, it's very similar to last quarter sort of on a rough order magnitude basis and kind of on the lower end of historical norms. Jerald Fishman I mean, typically, the turns business is somewhere inversely proportional to the lead times. So if you keep your lead times short, customers tend to believe they can get product quicker so there's more turns business and less inventory. If your lead times go out, just the opposite happens. So I think the only way you can ever win in this game is keep the lead time short, or else, you really don't have a clue of what's going on. Mindy Kohl Okay. That concludes our Q&amp;A session.

"content": "  By Mike YamamotoAnalog Devices  has been on a scorching run for several months but drew downside option activity yesterday as it faces a multi-year resistance level.optionMONSTER's Depth Charge system shows that 2,233 February 38 puts traded in a strong buying pattern, most of them going for $0.40. Open interest at the strike was fewer than 294 contracts, so the puts were bought to open new positions.ADI closed at 0.6 percent to $39.62, a day after it reached its highest price since July 2007. The chipmaker is up more than 40 percent since last August but is now on the cusp of resistance around $40 that it has tested unsuccessfully many times going all the way back to August 2004 .Yesterday's put buying was not tied to any stock trading that we saw, though it could be protection on a previous long position. It could also be a straight bearish bet that ADI will fall soon.In any case, the puts will be profitable if the stock falls more than 5 percent by the time they expire on Feb. 18. The company is looking at two major catalysts before then, its first-quarter earnings results after the market closes on Feb. 15 and a presentation at the Goldman Sachs Technology &amp; Internet Conference on Feb. 17. Analog Devices will also appear at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference on March 3.

"date": "Nov 23 2010, 09:22by: Zacks Investment Research", 
"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices Beats on Earnings, Offers Weak Outlook - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices  fiscal fourth quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, or 4.1%. Revenue beat by 1.9%. Results touched the high-end of management expectations on revenue and gross margin, but exceeded on the operating margin line. Despite the solid results, Analog Devices shares were down slightly  in after-hours trading, as investors discounted investments in the sector. We also note that while earnings continue to beat the Zacks Consensus, the surprise percentage has been trending down over the past 4 quarters. This explains the reason for the relatively small movement in Analog Devices share prices in response to the earnings announcement. Revenue Analog Devices' revenue of $770.0 million was up 6.9% sequentially, 34.7% year over year and at the high end of managements revenue guidance of $740-770 million . The communications and automotive end-markets grew the strongest on a sequential basis and computing was the only area that actually saw a decline. Growth was fairly broad-based across geographies, with the Americas and Japan registering the biggest increases.  Revenue by End Market The industrial market generated 45% of Analog Devices total revenue , driven by energy and healthcare sectors, as well as increasing demand from Analog Devices broad base of smaller scale industrial customers. Energy efficiency, productivity enhancements and security are fueling the increased spending in the segment. Europe, Japan and China were responsible for the growth in the last quarter. Communications generated 23% of total revenue, increasing 16.6% sequentially and 47.8% year over year. Analog Devices communications business comes from both infrastructure and cell phones, although the focus is on the infrastructure side. Analog Devices did not provoide specific commentary regarding the wireline infrastructure business, stating that wireless infrastructure was the major driver of revenue in the last quarter. The TDS CDMA phase 4 rollout in China and the gradual replacement of GSM by 3G fueled growth in the last quarter. With mobile operators racing to meet increasing data needs and improving the efficiency of their networks, demand for networking applications in the U.S. is also on the rise. Analog Devices converters, amplifiers and RF products are solidly positioned across all fast-growing geographies  and should generate very substantial growth for the company. The smartphone business also grew in the last quarter and management stated that Analog Devices products were well-received by customers. Consumer generated 18% of Analog Devices revenue. Segment revenue was up 5.3% sequentially but down 5.1% from a year ago, reflective of caution at customers in this segment. Portable media products, digital cameras and other consumer electronics products drove the sequential increase. The automotive segment  generated around 12% of Analog Devices revenue, growing 11.8% sequentially and 30.8% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase in the last quarter was driven by a more robust automotive market, which came off a seasonally weaker period. The main drivers here continue to be the global recovery, as well as increasing electronic content per vehicle, especially in the areas of infotainment, safety and fuel efficiency. This, along with increasing demand for high-end vehicles that use Analog Devices products are positives for the company. Analog Devices expressed optimism regarding its ability to continue increasing the dollar content per vehicle, as safety, fuel efficiency and conveniences become essential features of vehicles.  Computing accounted for the remaining 2% of Analog Devices revenue, down 5.7% sequentially and up 3.8% year over year. Management has taken a policy decision to avoid this market, since it is given to commoditization, making margin expansion difficult. Revenue by Product Line Both analog and DSP products witnessed strong double-digit growth from the year-ago quarter. Analog signal processing products  were up 7.3% sequentially and 34.3% year over year. Converters, amplifier and other analog products all contributed to the sequential increase. Converters are the largest product line, with a revenue share of over 46%. Power management and reference products generated 7% of revenue, up 4.2% sequentially and 54.9% year over year. The strength in this product line is the result of managements refocusing of the business over the past couple of years, as well as the ongoing recovery across all served markets.  Digital signal processing products  were up 5.1% sequentially and 27.5% year over year. Margins Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 67.0%, up 38 basis points  sequentially, 1,074 bps year over year and at the high end of managements guidance of 66-67%. Gross margins have expanded sequentially in each of the last five quarters. Gross margin improvements continue to come from higher volumes that enable better utilization rates, as well as a more favorable mix of business. Analog Devices expressed confidence that there remains further leverage in the model. Operating expenses of $230.5 million were flat sequentially and up 19.1% from the October quarter of 2009. However, the operating margin increased 224 bps sequentially and 1,465 bps year over year to 37.1%, better than Analog Devices expectations of 35-36%. Both R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses declined as a percentage of sales, contributing almost equally to the margin expansion in the last quarter. Of course, the stronger gross margin also helped. The pro forma net income was $225.0 million, or a 29.2% net income margin compared to $200.3 million, or 27.8% in the previous quarter and $105.6 million, or a 18.5% net income margin in the prior-year quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were $0.73 compared to $0.65 in the previous quarter and $0.36 in the October quarter of last year. The EPS was also better than managements expectations of $0.68 to $0.72. Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters mentioned above, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same. Balance Sheet Inventories increased 4.6% to $277.5 million, with annualized inventory turns increasing slightly from 3.6X to 3.7X reported at the end of the last quarter. Days sales outstanding  went up from 45 to 46. Cash generated from operations was around $274.3 million. The company spent $37.8 million on capex and $65.6 million on cash dividends and $35.8 million on share repurchases in the last quarter. The Board of Directors of Analog Devices authorised the purchase of an additional $1 billion worth of share repurchases. Guidance Analog Devices stated that while end markets continued to look strong, the company was likely to see higher turns in the business and lower backlog accumulation in the following quarter. This is expected to fetch revenues of $715-740 million, representing a sequential decline of 4-7%, or a year-over-year increase of 19-23%. Gross margins are expected to come in at 66% and operating margins at 34.5-35.5%, resulting in earnings per share of $0.63-$0.67. Therefore, not just revenue, but margins and net earnings are also expected to decline from the October quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of $0.63 a share when Analog Devices reported, which was the low end of the guided range. Our Recommendation Analog Devices shares currently have a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short term Hold recommendation. This is similar to its peers Microsemi Corporation , Fairchild Semiconductor  and Semtech Corporation , which also has a Zacks #3 Rank. The recommendations for the group are not so much because of weak demand, but more because of a stabilization in the growth rate. We do not expect very strong growth rates over the next few quarters for any of these companies, given that initial pent-up demand during the recession has largely been met.

"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices  reported a more than tripling of net income in their fiscal second quarter and reported both sales and earnings ahead of Wall Streets expectations. The maker of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits benefited from a 41% leap in total sales to $668.2 million versus estimates, particularly strong was revenue from industrial customers which grew by 54%. This surge in sales allowed ADI to pull in net income of $167.1 million or 55 cents per share, from $51.7 million or 18 cents per share last year. Analysts were expecting EPS of 50 cents on sales of $664.1 million, so the real results were far stronger than expected and the stock is more than 4% higher on Wednesday morning as a result. Not only was the quarter just ended better than expected, but the company was more optimistic towards the current quarter as well. Analog Devices upped guidance to 59 cents to 61 cents on sales of $695 million to $715 million in revenue. Coming into the report analysts were predicting 52 cents on $659.7 million, and the guidance was more aggressive than even the most bullish of analyst estimates . Gross margin rose to 65% from 55.1% in the last quarter, and ADI foresees a continuation of profitability in the 65% to 66% range next quarter. Management backed up their more profitable outlook by raising the quarterly dividend by 10% to $.22 per share. The implied annual yield now stands at 3.1% which of course is a slight improvement in our methodology. Dividend increases are a shareholder friendly action that we believe demonstrates the confidence that management has in the strength of the company going forward. The last time we wrote about Analog Devices on this blog was as a part of The Technology 10 article pointing to Undervalued tech stocks back in February of 2009. The timing of that article proved to be excellent as many on the list have doubled since then, but ADI which has seen fundamentals improve greatly has appreciated more modestly, about 50% since that time. With that said, we are reaffirming our Fairly Valued rating on ADI as of this weeks report. The stock does trade on the low side of its historically normal ranges of price-to-sales and price-to-cash earnings. Given the improvement to fundamentals we would not be surprised to see it trading at $34 per share before long, yet the downside risk could take it back down to $25 according to our methodology.Original post Source: Analog Devices Delivers Well Above Expectations  SA.Pages.Article.handleDisclosures;      This article was sent to 1,088 people who get email alerts on .

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices: Thriving in a Digital World - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices  is one of the largest suppliers of analog semiconductors. Analog chips are used to convert ambient data, such as temperature, sound, pressure, even light, into digitized data that can be processed and acted upon by electronic systems. Analog Devices' main products are used for these conversions, and also for amplifying certain signals, particularly voice, that are then transmitted and received around the globe. If you have a cell phone, some applications of this company's products are readily apparent. Analog-to-digital  voice conversion is a key component of digital cellular communications, as the data is sent over the air in digital format and \"re-created\" into sound by devices supplied by ADI and its competitors. Smart-phones require even more analog components, such as an accelerometer that is used to orient the screen to however the user is holding the device, for sensing ambient light to determine screen brightness, and for proximity sensors to determine when to turn off the touch screen when the user is holding the phone to his/her ear. The rapid growth of both smart-phones and tablets is an opportunity for ADI, as the firm is one of the top suppliers of accelerometers. Analog Devices' largest end market is industrial, which accounts for over 45% of sales. Other important segments are communications , and consumer . The automotive market drives about 12% of sales. If you think about all of the temperature and pressure monitoring systems required for a vehicle or an automated production system, the importance of analog chips becomes apparent. There are a *lot* of applications out there. At the same time, analog chips are a much better business than commodity digital components. For one, these chips are usually designed into an end product and can not be simply swapped out for a competitor's offering . This greatly limits the price elasticity and inventory problems that digital chipmakers face. Second, barriers to entry in this field are relatively high. Analog circuit design is a practical science that takes many years of experience to develop useful skills in, and the pool of exceptional designers is small. Given the relative consolidation in the field [ADI, Texas Instruments , ST Micro , and Linear Tech ] are the only major players), this sets up a limited competition oligarchy, a stark contrast to the hundreds of digital component suppliers, many in low-cost locales like Taiwan or China. The company itself is firing on all cylinders. In the just reported Q1, revenue rose 18% year-over-year, and record high margins drove a 39% increase in operating income. By moving into higher margin businesses, divesting lower margin ones, and cutting back on manufacturing capacity to increase utilization, Analog Devices has raised operating margin from about 25% in 2006 up to over 35% today. This margin should be sustainable for the foreseeable future. To top it off, ADI has a great balance sheet with over $3.4 billion in cash vs. just over $900 million in total debt. I believe the future for analog chip demand is very bright. Smart-phones, tablets, even laptop computers now carry half a dozen or more sensors. Analog chips are important in efficient power management, a huge concern for mobile devices . Automobiles continue to be outfitted with ever more sophisticated systems . There should be a significant amount of demand going forward. 2010 and 2011's big step up over 2008 levels probably shouldn't be used as a barometer, as a lot of pent-up demand from a poor 2009 was realized. But there is no reason ADI cannot grow at 10-15% rates over the next few years. Given this, and assigning a reasonable, historical multiple on the stock, my price target is $49. That represents a 19% upside from current prices - making this an easy stock to assign a positive rating to. Should ADI decline to back around $40, it will also become an attractive candidate for a Top Buy recommendation. Disclosure: Steve owns no position in any stocks discussed in this article.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices Delivers Well Above Expectations - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices  reported a more than tripling of net income in their fiscal second quarter and reported both sales and earnings ahead of Wall Streets expectations. The maker of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits benefited from a 41% leap in total sales to $668.2 million versus estimates, particularly strong was revenue from industrial customers which grew by 54%. This surge in sales allowed ADI to pull in net income of $167.1 million or 55 cents per share, from $51.7 million or 18 cents per share last year. Analysts were expecting EPS of 50 cents on sales of $664.1 million, so the real results were far stronger than expected and the stock is more than 4% higher on Wednesday morning as a result. Not only was the quarter just ended better than expected, but the company was more optimistic towards the current quarter as well. Analog Devices upped guidance to 59 cents to 61 cents on sales of $695 million to $715 million in revenue. Coming into the report analysts were predicting 52 cents on $659.7 million, and the guidance was more aggressive than even the most bullish of analyst estimates . Gross margin rose to 65% from 55.1% in the last quarter, and ADI foresees a continuation of profitability in the 65% to 66% range next quarter. Management backed up their more profitable outlook by raising the quarterly dividend by 10% to $.22 per share. The implied annual yield now stands at 3.1% which of course is a slight improvement in our methodology. Dividend increases are a shareholder friendly action that we believe demonstrates the confidence that management has in the strength of the company going forward. The last time we wrote about Analog Devices on this blog was as a part of The Technology 10 article pointing to Undervalued tech stocks back in February of 2009. The timing of that article proved to be excellent as many on the list have doubled since then, but ADI which has seen fundamentals improve greatly has appreciated more modestly, about 50% since that time. With that said, we are reaffirming our Fairly Valued rating on ADI as of this weeks report. The stock does trade on the low side of its historically normal ranges of price-to-sales and price-to-cash earnings. Given the improvement to fundamentals we would not be surprised to see it trading at $34 per share before long, yet the downside risk could take it back down to $25 according to our methodology.Original post Source: Analog Devices Delivers Well Above Expectations  SA.Pages.Article.handleDisclosures;      This article was sent to 1,088 people who get email alerts on .

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices: Thriving in a Digital World - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices  is one of the largest suppliers of analog semiconductors. Analog chips are used to convert ambient data, such as temperature, sound, pressure, even light, into digitized data that can be processed and acted upon by electronic systems. Analog Devices' main products are used for these conversions, and also for amplifying certain signals, particularly voice, that are then transmitted and received around the globe. If you have a cell phone, some applications of this company's products are readily apparent. Analog-to-digital  voice conversion is a key component of digital cellular communications, as the data is sent over the air in digital format and \"re-created\" into sound by devices supplied by ADI and its competitors. Smart-phones require even more analog components, such as an accelerometer that is used to orient the screen to however the user is holding the device, for sensing ambient light to determine screen brightness, and for proximity sensors to determine when to turn off the touch screen when the user is holding the phone to his/her ear. The rapid growth of both smart-phones and tablets is an opportunity for ADI, as the firm is one of the top suppliers of accelerometers. Analog Devices' largest end market is industrial, which accounts for over 45% of sales. Other important segments are communications , and consumer . The automotive market drives about 12% of sales. If you think about all of the temperature and pressure monitoring systems required for a vehicle or an automated production system, the importance of analog chips becomes apparent. There are a *lot* of applications out there. At the same time, analog chips are a much better business than commodity digital components. For one, these chips are usually designed into an end product and can not be simply swapped out for a competitor's offering . This greatly limits the price elasticity and inventory problems that digital chipmakers face. Second, barriers to entry in this field are relatively high. Analog circuit design is a practical science that takes many years of experience to develop useful skills in, and the pool of exceptional designers is small. Given the relative consolidation in the field [ADI, Texas Instruments , ST Micro , and Linear Tech ] are the only major players), this sets up a limited competition oligarchy, a stark contrast to the hundreds of digital component suppliers, many in low-cost locales like Taiwan or China. The company itself is firing on all cylinders. In the just reported Q1, revenue rose 18% year-over-year, and record high margins drove a 39% increase in operating income. By moving into higher margin businesses, divesting lower margin ones, and cutting back on manufacturing capacity to increase utilization, Analog Devices has raised operating margin from about 25% in 2006 up to over 35% today. This margin should be sustainable for the foreseeable future. To top it off, ADI has a great balance sheet with over $3.4 billion in cash vs. just over $900 million in total debt. I believe the future for analog chip demand is very bright. Smart-phones, tablets, even laptop computers now carry half a dozen or more sensors. Analog chips are important in efficient power management, a huge concern for mobile devices . Automobiles continue to be outfitted with ever more sophisticated systems . There should be a significant amount of demand going forward. 2010 and 2011's big step up over 2008 levels probably shouldn't be used as a barometer, as a lot of pent-up demand from a poor 2009 was realized. But there is no reason ADI cannot grow at 10-15% rates over the next few years. Given this, and assigning a reasonable, historical multiple on the stock, my price target is $49. That represents a 19% upside from current prices - making this an easy stock to assign a positive rating to. Should ADI decline to back around $40, it will also become an attractive candidate for a Top Buy recommendation. Disclosure: Steve owns no position in any stocks discussed in this article.

"content": "  Analog Devices  is due to report Q3 results after the bell tonight, and analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to post a profit of $0.73 per share on revenue of $780 million.

Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is May 21, 2013. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO, for opening remarks. Vincent T. Roche Thanks, Ali, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Before we talk about our operating results and the outlook for the coming quarter, it is true to say that a lot has happened since our last earnings call at the end of February. Many of you sent deep condolences upon learning of Jerry Fishman's sudden passing, and we thank you very much for those. I worked beside Jerry for many years and while, of course, we all miss him greatly on a personal level, Dave and I, along with our senior management team, and the many talented employees of ADI, will continue to do great things together. Our employees are engaged, our customers rely on us more and more as a preferred partner, and the market opportunities for us are vast. Our business priorities remain the same: leadership innovation in our core signal processing technologies; continuously assessing where we play, how we win and aligning our resources accordingly; and emphasizing strong profitability as a measure of the quality and sustainability of our innovation. We believe that our operating performance, supplemented with cash dividends and share repurchases, will continue to drive strong returns for shareholders. As you've seen from our press release, our results for the second quarter were solid. So let's take a look at what actually happened in more detail. Revenue totaled $659 million, up 6% from the previous quarter and down 2% from the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.52, up 18% from previous quarter. Both results were at the midpoint of the guidance we have provided. Our end markets, the revenue growth this quarter was led by Industrial and Automotive customers. Our industrial end markets, which are typically strong in the second quarter, grew 11% sequentially and made up 47% of our sales. The increase was broad-based across all regions and all major application areas within that segment, but was particularly strong in instrumentation and industrial automation applications. A significant portion of our Industrial revenue is serviced through our distribution partners, and during the second quarter, order momentum through the channel was strong and higher than in the prior quarter. It appears that orders and shipments were in good equilibrium as the inventory in the channel remained low. Now while we cannot predict with certainty regarding the short term, these order trends and low inventory levels are positive signs for our Industrial business. Longer term, we are driving innovation to higher levels to ensure that ADI increases our share of the industrial market. Over the past few years, we have been focusing more of our investments toward industrial applications, where mechanical and electromechanical systems are increasingly integrating electronics to provide intelligent sensing and control, connectivity and energy efficiency, which are all themes that we believe will drive growth for this broad and diverse market over the long term. In the automotive sector, revenue increased 14% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, reflecting strength in North America and China for the auto sector, and growth in worldwide luxury vehicle sales for ADI is especially well represented. This end market was 19% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Sales increased sequentially across our focused applications in powertrain, infotainment and safety, with particular strength in active safety, advanced driver assistance systems. These systems are seeing accelerating adoption rate, not only in premium vehicles, but also in mainstream vehicles as these new safety features become standard equipment, whether due to consumer demand or indeed government mandate. We also experienced strong growth from start-stop powertrain applications for internal combustion engines and also battery control for hybrid electric vehicles. These features improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions and are also driven by growing consumer demand and government mandates. The automotive industry premium brands are the drivers of innovation, and these are the brands that have adopted our MEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers, converters, RF and other analog and DSP technologies. We continue to distinguish ADI as an innovation partner and a high-quality supplier with industry-leading reliability ratings. As electronic content in vehicles continues to grow, ADI is well positioned, as demonstrated by our results over the last 5 years with our automotive business growing at a 16% CAGR while vehicle unit growth averaged a 3% CAGR over that period. In communications infrastructure, sales were down 2% after being down 12% in the prior quarter, and this business represented 19% of our total sales in the second quarter. Communications networks, both wireless and wired, are transitioning too, and these transitions present a strong long-term opportunity for ADI's broadband radio, optical and cable infrastructure technology. In wireless infrastructure, the major transition everyone is watching is from 3G to 4G and TD-LTE. In wired infrastructure, new equipment with higher levels of throughput such as 40- and 100-gigabit optical and emerging standards, such as cable DOCSIS 3.1, will form the core Metro and EDGE networks in the future and create growth opportunities for ADI. As our results in the last 2 quarters have shown, we are in the early stages of these transitions. For example, the transition to a new wireless standard happens in a couple of phases. Initially, carrier capital spending is focused on coverage more so than capacity, and subscribers upgrade their devices and their service agreements. But the need for increased capacity soon becomes clear as networks become overloaded, and carriers find it difficult to deliver significantly higher data rates and increased capacity with their existing equipment. Increase in capacity is highly dependent on high bandwidth, spectrum efficiency and network densification, where ADI's considerable wideband radio technology brings significant competitive advantages for our customers and in turn, for the carriers. Now in wired applications, our focus is primarily the design challenge around signal integrity, as well as the data path, transmit and receive. Our interface clock and data recovery, and power management solutions, are used to control and monitor signal propagation in optical and cable infrastructure, which are being upgraded to support 40-gig-plus speeds. And finally, the Consumer business was 15% of sales in the second quarter, which was down from 17% of sales in the prior quarter. We saw sequential growth in line with improving seasonality in the applications where ADI's technology has been well established over many generations, such as digital imaging and prosumer audio/video applications. Portable devices declined sequentially but were up significantly year-over-year, in line with customers' new product cycles. As we've mentioned before, there are many good opportunities ahead in portable devices and consumer audio and imaging for ADI. We continue to be highly selective in our engagements, focusing on applications where customers value our innovation, and pursuing engineering challenges where we can leverage our existing core technology and make a demonstrable difference to the user experience. So with that, I'll turn you over to Dave who will now take you through some of the details of our financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Vince mentioned, second quarter revenue increased 6% sequentially and declined 2% year-over-year to $659 million. Our gross margin was 64% in the second quarter. This was up from 62.7% in the first quarter due to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs. As has been the case now for several quarters, we again carefully managed production levels in our facilities. Utilization increased from the mid-50s in the first quarter to approximately 60% in the second quarter, while our inventory declined on our balance sheet by $8 million. Inventory on our balance sheet on a dollars basis is now at its lowest level in 5 quarters. On a days basis, inventory was down from 121 days in the prior quarter to 115 days in the second quarter, in good position relative to our model. Our plan is to increase utilization in the third quarter to the low 60s. This should keep our days of inventory approximately flat to second quarter levels. Inventories distribution on a dollars basis was approximately flat in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, but inventories distribution on a days basis was lower than the prior quarter by about 0.5 week at 7.5 weeks. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. Total end customer orders, which include both OEM and distribution, increased in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and our book-to-bill was slightly above 1. On a regional basis, orders improved across all regions, with particular strengths in North America and Europe. Overall, order patterns improved throughout the quarter. Regarding operating expenses, we recorded approximately $6 million of additional expense in the second quarter related to the onetime accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation. Excluding this special item, operating expenses were $224.5 million compared to about $223 million in the prior quarter, which as a percent of revenue, is 170-basis-point improvement. We continue to be very watchful of operating expenses and plan on reducing operating expense ratios by constraining expense growth to rates that are less than our sales growth rates in the coming quarters. Operating profits before tax for the second quarter, excluding this onetime expense, were $197.7 million or 30% of sales. This was about 300 basis points higher than the prior quarter's operating profit of 26.9% of sales, excluding a special charge in that quarter. Other expenses of $3.7 million in the second quarter was flat to the first quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense at current debt levels. Our second quarter tax rate was 16.5% excluding onetime items, and we expect our tax rate to be at that level for the next 2 quarters. Diluted earnings per share of $0.52, excluding special items, was at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow in the second quarter continued to be very strong. We generated 38% of our revenue or $252 million in operating cash flow. CapEx was $26 million, resulting in free cash flow of $226 million or 34% of revenue. Our cash and short-term investments balance increased about $185 million during the second quarter and now stands at $4.2 billion, with $1.2 billion available domestically. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $760 million in debt outstanding. Our accounts receivable balance was up $4 million versus the last quarter on higher overall shipments in the quarter, and our days sales outstanding decreased to 46 days from 48 days. During the second quarter, we returned approximately $109 million or a 49% -- 48% of free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through cash dividends. On May 20, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on June 11, 2013, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2013. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%. I'll just take a moment to talk about our long-term shareholder return strategy. Since 2004, we have paid a quarterly dividend and increased it 10x over that period. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 129 million shares, driving shareholder returns even higher. In total, over that period, we have returned over $6 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. So over the last 3 years, we have returned to shareholders an average of approximately 60% of our free cash flow. And what I'd like to say today is that over the next 5 years, we plan to increase that ratio to average approximately 80% through a program of both increasing dividends and disciplined buybacks. Of course, quarter-to-quarter, we'll be above or below this, but over the 5 years, this is our new target. In summary, the second quarter delivered good results for ADI. Our operating model turned a 6% sequential increase in revenue into an 18% sequential increase in diluted EPS at relatively low levels of utilization. We have plenty of leverage ahead as sales increase, factory utilization improves from its current low levels, and we continue to tightly control operating expenses. So now I'll turn the call back over to Vince who will discuss ADI's outlook for the third quarter. Vincent T. Roche Thanks, Dave. Our lead times continue to be short, which limits our visibility somewhat and, as you know, the world economy remains uncertain. In addition, the last month of our third fiscal quarter is the July month, which can sometimes be weaker due to summer shutdowns. Having said that, order momentum is positive, and if this positive momentum continues, we are likely to see sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, which could be, we believe, as much as 4%. However, if the macro economy weakens, we could be approximately flat. Therefore, we're planning for revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $685 million. The midpoint of this range would be in line with the average third quarter growth rate we have seen over the last 5 years. By end market, we expect our Communications, Automotive and Consumer businesses to remain approximately flat to second quarter levels. We're planning for our Industrial business to grow sequentially, given low channel inventory and good end-customer order rates. We are forecasting gross margins to increase approximately 50 basis points from the 64% we achieved in the second quarter. Though factory utilization is planned to be higher in the third quarter, it will still be quite low, yet if we achieve the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we will generate more than 90% gross margin drop-through on incremental sales. Our plan is for operating expenses to be approximately $226 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of a full quarter with the annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Based on these estimates and excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.56 in the third quarter. So in conclusion, we see momentum, order rates are solid and inventories are low. We are well positioned to expand margins as factory loading increases and expenses remain under tight control, and also to continue generating strong earnings leverage and strong free cash flow, which as Dave discussed earlier, we will use to further improve shareholder returns. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Vince. [Operator Instructions] So with that, operator, we are now ready for questions from tonight's participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Guys, is there anything notable about linearity of orders in the quarter? And is there any different -- difference in segment relative to that linearity? David A. Zinsner Actually, I think I even mentioned in the prepared remarks. Actually, the orders strengthened through the quarter, so that was obviously a positive sign. Clearly, Industrial was stronger than the others, which is why in Vince's outlook, he suggested that, that one had the best likelihood of being up in the third quarter. Vincent T. Roche Yes. We've also seen a little momentum in the latter part of the quarter in the communications infrastructure segment. So coupled with the industrial area, they were the 2 sectors that produced most momentum through the quarter, particularly in the latter part, as Dave said. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Helpful. And then any turns assumptions differences relative to previous quarters or similar kind of turns being assumed to get to the midpoint of the guidance? David A. Zinsner Jim, it's -- I think I've mentioned probably every quarter since I've been here it's tough to use the turns calculation, in that backlog includes orders from the distributors on us, and the revenue isn't necessarily the same as it's shipped through to the end customer. But having said that, we're in a very short lead time environment. We've been in this lead time environment for many quarters now. I'd expect that the turns will be pretty similar to what they were in prior quarters. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division I wanted to drill into your capital return target a little bit more. Clearly, I think you said 80% is going to be the rate which you target going forward. Can you provide us just your sort of qualitative context for deciding between buyback and dividend yields? And in general, what's the appropriate dividend yields or free cash flow payout for ADI? David A. Zinsner Yes. We generally don't look at cash or -- yes, we generally don't drive the dividend based on yield. We drive dividend based on looking at our earnings and giving out a percentage of those earnings in the form of a dividend. It just so happens that it translates into this 3% yield, although we're mindful of it. It's certainly something that we pay attention to, but it isn't the major driver of how we drive the dividend. Our goal is dividend is our primary means of returning cash to shareholders. We want it to continue. We want it to grow as earnings grow. And we look at the buyback as more of our opportunistic opportunity to enhance the cash going back to shareholders, albeit at different intervals depending on the stock price relative to kind of historical levels. And then what was the second question, Terence? I missed that part. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division So I wanted to just understand what the trade-off was in terms of you thinking about allocating toward dividend, but I think you may have answered that question. If I could actually ask a different follow-up question, Dave. As I look at the second half of the fiscal year and also looking at context of last year, we saw really Consumer accelerate quite a bit and really outgrow Industrial. I was just wondering, for purposes of considering gross margin, as we look at the second half of this year, should we, again, expect another acceleration in Consumer in the second half? David A. Zinsner Well, generally -- and Vince, feel free to chime in, but I think that we would normally expect, and we'll just have to kind of wait and see how it goes, that Consumer generally has a seasonally strong fourth quarter. And so there's, at this point, no reason to expect otherwise, although it's early and we don't have any bookings yet. What we're hoping is that also Industrial continues its momentum. Last year, there was a bit of a redirection on the Industrial business in the back half of the year as kind of overall economic sentiment started to deteriorate through the back half of the year. And so Industrial's mix kind of came down, but we're hopeful that this is the start of recovery and we don't see that. But again, it's early. We'll have to kind of be watchful of both. The good news is that the margins -- the gross margins if that's kind of the lead in to the question, does mix change? I don't think the mix changes too dramatically because all the margins in all our end markets are actually pretty good and pretty close to the corporate average. So regardless of what happens, I think we'll do a pretty good job of seeing gross margin leverage through the back half of the year, assuming conditions continue to be strong. Vincent T. Roche Yes, to add a little color to what David said. We're in the transition between 3G and 4G in wireless infrastructure, and as that gains pace, we're very well positioned as a company with good market share, a lot of good design coverage and extra bill of materials value in 4G compared to 3G. So as that starts to gather steam, which we hope is sometime in the second half of the year, albeit -- so far, the carriers have been fairly skittish. But somewhere, we believe, in the fourth quarter into the early part of the coming year, we do expect to see the carriers start to accelerate the buildout of their networks in terms of capacity rather than coverage. So I think that will help the margin structures and the growth overall for the company. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Hey, Dave, on the new -- the cash flow guidance on the 80% of your free cash flow, can you remind us what your normal domestic operating free cash flow is? And can you help us thread together how you get to an $0.80 -- 80% payout over time. Because I think, if I remember correctly, that your domestic cash flow is something around 1/3, so just trying to get some clarity on that. David A. Zinsner It certainly can be -- it's a little bit lumpy so some quarters, it can be as much as 50%, some quarters, it could be lower than 30%. What we have is we have $1.2 billion or $1.1 billion of U.S. cash. We'll certainly utilize some of that cash to ramp up the cash flow to shareholders. And then on top of that, I would expect we would be able to add leverage, if necessary, to augment the cash we have and the cash flow we're getting from the U.S. entity to enable us to get to the 80% level. We've stress tested this level to make sure that under different scenarios, based on what happens from an economic perspective over the next 5 years, we would still be able to achieve the 80%. And we feel more than comfortable that we can get there. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research And no change to your longer-term tax outlook in terms of incentive? David A. Zinsner No -- yes, this will not influence the tax story. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. And then just another final one. On the Automotive side, you had very good growth in Q2, it's flattening out in Q3. What are some of the signals you're seeing as we get into the back half of the year from the Automotive end market as it relates to how you think that's going to evolve for the back half? Vincent T. Roche Well, I think there's been brisk building of demand in the first and, particularly, the second quarter. We've seen a little tapering in demand from the automotive customers. And also when we get into the summer period, you very often get just the seasonal vacation cooldown. So overall, the long-term growth, we're very, very bullish about, we're very confident about. But in the third quarter, we're just a little cautious based on immediate demand pattern. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao with Bank of America. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division A question on communications. Sales, was disappointed in the April quarter, and you had a couple of quarters of year-on-year growth earlier. And it seemed to have turned the corner, but now it's down again year-on-year. So first, what caused the miss in April quarter? And second, I would have assumed that the shift in CapEx towards 4G and 3G would've helped offset some of the spending sluggishness. Just wondering why hasn't that been the case in your comps business for the last 2 to 3 years? Vincent T. Roche Well, I think we've had, over a 5-year period up to our fiscal '13 year, we had growth in our wireless business of around 9% compounded. And I think what we're seeing is a certain level of caution on the CapEx layout by the carriers, that's for sure. There's been a delay in the rollout of the next generation of the Chinese system, it's been delayed. Europe, in general, I think has been very slow. Our growth has been largely driven by American -- our OEMs who sell to American carriers. That's been quite strong, and America's been aggressive in building out the 4G network. But largely, again, as I mentioned in the script, really just building a coverage footprint rather than densifying the network or building a lot more capacity, which is going to happen. So we're still reliant very heavily on 3G, and I think what we expect to see is 3G will start ramping down over the next 12 months. We expect to see 4G ramp up, and at that point, I think we'll be very well positioned to take share, see growth and get back into the high single-digits, low double-digit compounded growth rates. I think it's more -- it certainly it is how the market is performing rather than our technology -- certainly from a technology standpoint. From a competitive advantage standpoint, we're in better shape than we've ever been. As you know, we've been steering a lot of R&amp;D into building the underlying technologies in the products over the last 3 or 4 years, and we're starting to see the benefits in terms of design ins. And our engagements are stronger than they've ever been with the key OEMs. So it really is more about how the market performs than ADI. Ali Husain Aashish, do you have a follow-up question? Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Yes. The only one would be on Automotive. I think you highlighted North America and China being strong this quarter. And I think some of the European data points have been somewhat weaker. So just any color on what your current exposure is and how you see that changing over the next couple of years? Vincent T. Roche Well, we're strong in -- with all the major players, when it comes to safety, infotainment and powertrain applications, we have tremendous share in all those applications. So my sense is our business has been largely based on strength geographically in Europe and America over the last 5 or 7 years. We continue to gain share in these regions. But over the last couple of quarters, we've had some very good breakthroughs as well in Asia, in particular in Japan. So one of the things I think we mentioned, we've talked about it various times is that we've been very heavily focused on expanding our reach into Asia, and that's beginning to really pay dividends for the company. So again, I think it's more about how the market performs than ADI. We're in good position from customer penetration standpoint and the technologies we have are being adopted more and more into the applications that I've outlined here. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division I just want to follow up more on the guidance, Vince. It seems like your commentary was that the order book was relatively okay. You made some comments on the Auto order trends falling off. Just more broadly, was it just in Autos where you saw a little bit of weakness and kind of where are you adding the conservatism? Vincent T. Roche Well, we're expecting the third quarter, we're expecting momentum from the Industrial business. As I said, up to now, the order patterns have been strong in Industrial. That gives us a lot of encouragement. And as long as those order patterns continue, as I've said in the script, we believe that our revenues in infrastructure, Automotive and Consumer will be relatively flat in the third quarter. So I think I see Industrial order patterns continue. I would feel bullish about hitting the upper end of the range that we've presented to you today. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Okay. And then I just wanted to better understand the comments in Consumer. It seemed like you mentioned you were trying to be selective, and that's understandable given that segment with the gross margin profile and such. I just wanted to understand that you also said that you expected a ramp in the back half. Is -- can you just talk about how you've approached business selection there? And you had a very strong ramp last year. When you say a ramp this year, are you talking similar magnitude? David A. Zinsner So I think, since I answered it, I guess I have -- should answer this one. I don't want to suggest that we think we have some massive ramp. I mean what we're just -- in the context of mix, normally, Consumer has a better fourth quarter, and that's all that I was suggesting. We're not going to get into guidance, really, for the fourth quarter because that's what we do in the third quarter. Vincent T. Roche Yes, so when we talk about. We have we -- I might have explained before, our Consumer business has a few different components to it. We have a very horizontal or a very diverse business in areas like broadcast and prosumer, as we call it, audio/video imaging applications, with a more kind of catalog type products that are very diversely used across all the major regions of the world with companies who build broadcast equipment, professional equipment for enterprises and so on. That's a good foundation business for ADI. When we talk about picking our spots carefully, we are really referring to the portable areas, all types of equipment, be they tablets or smartphones. We still have a business in the digital camera space. When we talk about being careful, we try to define the end application very carefully from a user standpoint to be able -- and we try to describe that application over multiple generations, so that we can be sure from an application standpoint that we're really delivering value that consumers ultimately will be excited about. So we -- also, when you play in the consumer space, the -- obviously, the life cycles are very, very short. You've got to be able to play through multiple generations. And for each application that we play in, typically, we have to have a couple of concurrent design themes in play to be able to get the generation sequentially synching, so that we exit from one generation but we have the next generation ready to play straightaway. So it's -- sure, it's an expensive place to play from an R&amp;D standpoint, but the returns are great when you pick the applications carefully and get with the right customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division It relates to gross profit margin and the contribution margin on the gross line going forward. Can you remind us of the manufacturing strategy in terms of which end markets are more heavily outsourced versus made internally, so where we could think about getting operating leverage on the gross line? David A. Zinsner Yes. I mean, there's products manufactured internally that target all end markets, but I would say there's a bias, a slight bias, towards the Industrial end market. So as the Industrial grows, that does utilize the internal facilities a bit more. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division That's great. And then one that I think you answered at least partly before but I'd like to just dig into it again. It sounds like you're telling us that while Automotive was very strong, the order pattern fell off at the end of the quarter. And we've also heard of some less robust end market data points, and notwithstanding the content growth story that we all understand is going on in semis, I think there's some concern that there's been a lot of strength, in particular in the most recent quarter, that you set yourselves and others have demonstrated in this end market. But the OE demand doesn't look as robust. Can you help us understand whether there might be an inventory build going on in that market? Vincent T. Roche I think the way to look at that market, Europe has been very, very muted from a car sales standpoint, although there are indications that I've seen over the last few weeks that new car registrations in some of the European countries are starting to pick up again. So I think it's more about how the geographies are playing out rather than anything underlying in the consumption patterns, demand and consumption patterns. So my sense is that certainly from our standpoint, I think the inventories are quite lean in that area, the automotive area. And it really is more about how the market is behaving at the geographic level than anything else. Operator Your next question comes from the line of the Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division Just on the same Automotive line, I was wondering -- I mean, Europe is, obviously, a big portion for you, 40%. It's been a little slow in the first half. Do you see it picking up in the second half? And also in China, there's been some concern about tariffs coming back on China because -- is that how you see? I guess, some more color on both those regions. David A. Zinsner So the first question is whether you see European car sales coming back. And I think you've answered that, which is that is an area where we released our early read from external sources and that registrations appear to be growing in that space so there is some reason to be positive. Having said that, I mean, the European car manufacturers end up selling all over the world. And there's some big consumption in other markets for some of the premium brands that are manufactured in Europe. So we're not necessarily at the mercy of the economy over in Europe. So that's, I think, one significant point. The other question was -- what was the question? Ali Husain It was tariffs and... David A. Zinsner Tariffs, yes. I mean, I'll -- Vince can answer that if he wants to, but I don't think we have enough clarity. We're not selling cars. So I'm not sure we have enough visibility into what's going on with the Chinese government and how they're going to manage internal versus external manufacturing of autos. Did you have a follow-up question, Vijay? Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division Yes, sure, sure. In Industrial, what were the key markets there for you? And what signs are you seeing that gives you optimism on the second half on Industrial? Vincent T. Roche Well, the strongest 2 sectors -- I mean, we grew everywhere. All of the sub-applications in Industrial grew for ADI. The strongest were instrumentation, as well as industrial automation, things like factory automation, process control. They are our 2 biggest subsectors in Industrial, and both of them grew very, very well during the quarter. So typically anywhere in the second quarter, we see good -- very good seasonality in the industrial area. But -- and as we said, the order patterns that we're seeing in the industrial area at large, big customers, small customers, all regions are performing quite well today. So based on that, based on what we hear from our customers, we believe inventories are very, very lean, by the way, and that there's a good match between supply and demand in that area. So turns rates are quite high at the present time as well. Our distributors have also told us the same thing, at least our 2 major distributors, so the -- and there are good macro trends in place as well that we've discussed from time to time around safety, connectivity, efficiency, productivity that make this a very -- a more and more attractive space for ADI, given our breadth of technology and given our reach across the globe with large and small customers. So I think at the present time, what we're seeing is primarily a seasonality effect, but demand continues, at least in the short term, briskly in the industrial area. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with ISI. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division First question on the wireless infrastructure piece. Vince, you noted it strengthened at the end of the quarter but you're guiding the quarter flat in that segment into July. I'm just curious as to how we reconcile sort of the momentum at the end of the quarter versus the flat guide? And your comment on the delay with respect to the transition in China, is that a new comment or is that still implying that we should start to see some kind of a ramp in the... Vincent T. Roche Yes, well -- first off, the delay, our business is -- the largest part of our business in wireless communications infrastructure is still 3G, it's about 70% of our total. So the transition to 4G creates a new opportunity for ADI, and that's just taking a bit longer than we all had anticipated. So it's also a bit of a lumpy business. It's very hard to read. At the end of the day, our customers' customers, they're the carriers, are -- I think there's no great momentum, there's no great pattern in their spending at the present time. So it's just very hard to read. So that's why we're being cautious. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then, I guess, my -- as my follow-up question for...check that [ph]. As a follow-up question, Industrial has done well. It was up double digits last quarter, implied in the outlook as something like 4%, 5% sequential growth, given that it's half the business, and the other businesses are flat sequentially, which brings it sort of back to the peak run rate you had in the Industrial business last year. So I guess, my question is do you feel, at this point as you exit the July quarter, you'd be caught up with consumption, understanding that this is hard to ascertain with finality but what's your best sense? David A. Zinsner I'll take this one. I think it's obviously very difficult to read 60,000 customers to know for sure what their inventory levels are. Having said that, we do seem to be, at least as you look at distributors running at levels that are pretty consistent with their end demand. My best guess is that we are somewhere around where end demand or end consumption is. But I think what really is driving this kind of similar levels to last year is more around just kind of a lot of economic uncertainty that continues to overhang the market. So hopefully, as the year progresses, there is more confidence around the economy globally, and things continue to improve throughout the year. But at this point, it's hard to say. I mean, I think we're at least hopeful, given that the outlook at the moment is that Industrial will be up, as you said, reasonably well. That we're on the course of a recovery. But again, we're just going to have to wait and see how it goes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Vince, with regard to the products, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about converters from the perspective of the fact that it looks like that's up 1% year-over-year. I guess, probably the best-performing category, and I think that's -- the growth there is better than overall company revenue growth. So obviously, you guys continue to do well in that category. Can you talk a little bit about strategy there? How do you go to market versus, I don't want to say specifically TI, but obviously they're a big player in that space than the other guys. How do you continue to sort of dominate the market? Vincent T. Roche Yes, it's a good question. So converters for ADI are pervasive in every application in which we play. Every one of those segments that we've talked about today use converters, either high-speed or precision. We -- when we think about allocating our R&amp;D, we think first and foremost, that the underlying core technologies and products and make, we insist on making sure that we have adequate coverage in terms of R&amp;D to be able to develop the underlying technologies and products. The converter space is an area where we have the broadest portfolio. If you look at any federal [ph] converter, any particular performance dimension of converters in precision, in high speed, we cover the entire thing. We have teams working on new generations of technology that we haven't even introduced to the market yet, so we are pushing innovation in the core products that are critical to ADI's prosperity in the short term. We're also pushing very, very long term new architectures, new process technologies and combining converters also in many new ways in new applications. So the -- in the infrastructure space, for example, in communication, the wireless part of communications infrastructure, our converters form the heart of these wideband radio transceivers that we developed that have a lot of RF technology onboard. That are more and more linking up with the power management solutions that we have, linking up with the clocking solutions that we have. So it's a vast portfolio of standard products, products that are more highly integrated with converters at their core. And as I said, we, first and foremost, make sure that our core technologies are getting adequate investment to ensure that ADI keeps leadership position and keep -- we keep gaining share. We have been gaining, by the way, over the past number of years, just about 1% market share per year versus the competition on a compounded basis. So 1 point per year. So we're in good position, we've lots of new applications. For example, I would like to point out that in the automotive area, when you look at -- we talk about battery technology and intelligent battery systems. Again, that's a great example of where our converters, our precision converters, are being used in new ways and new applications in a critical application in the car. So there are many, many new areas where we play. And then if you look at the industrial area, we have -- perhaps, we've thousands of products that are selling thousands of converter products with very, very long life cycles. So we have a tremendous mix in terms of the market that we cover, the types of technology that we're developing and the types of customers to whom we sell. Ali Husain I think these are called converters with attitude right, Vince? Steve, do you have a follow-up question? Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Yes, sure. Dave, with regard to the 80%, how do you decide 80% is the right number versus some other? And if you were to, say, use some cash to pay down debt, is that in that 80% or is that something different? David A. Zinsner So first of all, just to clarify the 80% number, make sure that's crystal clear, that's 80% of total free cash flow, not 80% of domestic cash flow. Hopefully, that was clear. But how do we come up with it? We ran -- it's like I said, we ran some scenarios around business conditions. We added in some other potential uses of cash on top of that, which in some cases does include the financing side. And what it told us was, given our capital structure and our rating, we could easily manage 80%. I think we're very comfortable with the debt level we have. And so there's no reason when instruments mature that we need to pay them off. We can kind of refinance them assuming rates are attractive, which they clearly are today. We could -- we even feel comfortable going up in debt from where we are today. So we kind of balance all those things together and kind of -- and given Vince's -- one of his stated priorities is to deliver good shareholder return, we thought that this was a pretty reasonable number that we thought investors would appreciate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just one more question on the increased payout ratio. And by the way, I think I speak for the entire buy side when I say kudos for upping it from 60% to 80%. Just a question on the buyback. Your share count has crept up, I think, over the last 4 quarters. Can you just remind us of what's been allocated for the buyback? Has that increased? And is your methodology for buying back shares going to change at all? David A. Zinsner So we have, I think, roughly $500 million plus, maybe it was $540 million or something like that. Ali, do you know the number off hand? Ali Husain 560 David A. Zinsner $560 million of authorized -- our authorization on the current buyback, although it's pretty simple to get that increase to support the 80%. I think it will need to be increased, candidly, to get to the 80%. But let's see how earnings go, we don't -- the dividend, how that ramps, too, because that certainly an area that we want to increase over time as well. What was the other part of the question, Chris? Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Yes, Dave, I think we've talked about this before. One of the -- I guess one of the good problems that you have as your stock has steadily climbed up, you haven't really... David A. Zinsner Yes, yes. Yes, so that has been the case. I think in my prepared comments, I used the word disciplined repurchases or something of that nature. And that's kind of the way we're going to approach it. So it's not going to be 80% every quarter. In some quarters, it's going to be higher than 80%. Some quarters, it's going to be lower than 80%. But over the 5 years, it will average 80%. But we still intend to be pretty disciplined around the buybacks. And hopefully, buy back when the stock is at least on a historical basis at relatively low levels. So I wouldn't look for us to come right out of the gate and start turning a buyback. But I think over time, you'll see us be pretty good disciplined buyers of the stock, with the idea that we don't want to see that share count creep in general. Operator The next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division I remember last quarter, you had talked about distribution inventories being extremely low in dollar terms at a multi-quarter low, and so I was a little surprised that they stayed flat. And just can you talk about that dynamic? And then I feel like the end customer inventories that you've been describing is low. We've all felt that way for several quarters. What do you think it's going to take to change that? David A. Zinsner So I think a much more robust demand picture will certainly get distributor -- and a lead time stretch-out will certainly get distributors to begin to stock. We generally keep our lead times tight so we won't be the driver of it, but some of our peers sometimes allow their lead times to extend. And during those periods, distributors generally across-the-board raise their inventory levels. But it's 7.5 weeks. It's a pretty good -- it's certainly at a low level but they've certainly been below that. So it's what I think is a healthy level in a period of recovery. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Okay, great. And then just on the industrial customer side, on their inventory, I mean, as I said, you've described it as low for, I think, 4 or 5 quarters and I felt the same way. Do you think it's isolated at all in retrospect? As you look back, there's build up in the first part last year then come down or has it been generally lean throughout? David A. Zinsner I think in the second quarter, based on hindsight, they probably did start to build inventory, and then over the third and fourth quarter, potentially even the first quarter, started to bring it back down. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Great. Just a question, a follow-up, Vince, to something you said earlier about the comms business. With 70% of that being 3G-oriented, what sort of substitution effect do you guys see because to be frank, we've been waiting for quite some time for you guys and many other companies that have promised a big infrastructure spend increase. And it seems to me there's a risk that the 3G comes down as the 4G goes up and the total really doesn't move as fast as people have hoped. Can you walk us through the transition and the puts and takes to ADI, please? Vincent T. Roche Yes, I think what we see between the generations is more sophisticated solutions being required from ADI. We get more content. I believe, in 3G systems, we're seeing an average ASP increase for a radio transceiver of somewhere in the region of 20% to 30% depending on exactly who we're selling to and what the feature set is. So I think that chunk of what we expect is primarily due to the ASP increases. We also have -- we've mentioned before that we've greatly increased our R&amp;D in the wireless sector in the past 4 or 5 years to make sure that we can extend our reach, our competitive advantage, in each of the critical macro applications. So I think it's more about -- for ADI anyway, we're very well positioned with our customers, we have stronger solutions than we've ever had, so we're just depending, Ross, on the markets more so than anything else at this point. But everything we hear from the carrier discussions we've had, from our customers, somewhere in the region of -- just to be able to meet the data capacity needs that mobile subscribers are requiring now all across the globe. It's going to require a revamping, an aggressive revamping of the network towards 4G towards the back end of this year and into next year. Ali Husain Ross, did you have a follow-up? Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Yes. Just really quickly, a couple of housekeeping ones, and I apologize if I missed this earlier. Dave, your expectations for utilization and internal inventory as you go into the third quarter? David A. Zinsner Yes, I think we'll be kind of low 60s in utilization next quarter. Inventory levels on an absolute dollar basis may be kind of flattish, but they should come down in days. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division I think most of us recognize ADI's high-quality franchising. You guys are tied to some pretty attractive markets. But when I look at the growth, at least on a year-over-year basis, it's been -- this quarter and the July quarter will be the eighth consecutive quarter that revenue is down year-over-year. And my question is would you guys just chalk that up to a tough end market environment or, Vince, in your new role, are you looking at perhaps some different strategies to improve top line growth? Vincent T. Roche It's a very good question. I think what we're seeing at the present time is really just no real momentum but it's driven by just the macroeconomic everywhere, I mean, across the globe. Even China has not been immune to the macroeconomic malaise in the past year, year plus. We, as a company, we're an innovation-centered company with -- where engineering excellence really, really matters to us, where we have a lot of very, very -- people who care passionately about our customers. So we're going to do everything we can to extend our -- the impact and the speed of our innovation, and just to execute better everywhere to speed everything up in the company and just improve ADI in every dimension of innovation. So I believe that the franchise we have is one of the very, very best in the semiconductor world. And myself with the 9,000 employees are going to make it an even better franchise in the future. So we're working on a lot of things internally to make everything better. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division A couple of questions just quick. David, I'm a little confused by the opening comments. Utilization is going to be up or down in the July quarter, and ditto on OpEx. It just sounds like you guys are still keeping things pretty tight. And I guess, my question is if things were to pick up or does the lack of utilization growth or OpEx growth in July quarter give us a poker tell into how you guys are viewing the October quarter? David A. Zinsner Well, utilization is going to be up next quarter. And I think it was like around 60%, I think it's going to be in the low 60s, consistent with our expectations around the Industrial business for the most part. I wouldn't read too much into our OpEx for next quarter as some indication of the next few quarters. What we're trying to do is really lag the revenue side a little bit because leverage is pretty important to us. And quite honestly, we think we're spending enough money to drive revenue growth. So we're going to just be careful about where we add, make sure we're adding it in the right places that we think will drive good ROI. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division And then quickly, David or Vincent, can you guys give us a little bit of insight on what big buckets or sub-buckets there are within the Consumer? Is this mostly handset or how do I think about kind of the sub-buckets within that category? David A. Zinsner Okay. We'll answer this one, but we got to like, we've got to stop the follow-ons because we're going to run out of time here. But there's about 4 or 5 subcategories, portable is one of them. It's one of our areas that we think will drive growth but it's by no means a dominant part of that business. We have a digital camera subcategory in there. We have a home entertainment system, which includes, I think, prosumer, which Maria tells me is a real word. There is some computer exposure in that space and then we have a bunch of smaller subcategories that get the \"all other\" kind of classification. So it's a pretty -- from a consumer perspective, it's a pretty diverse set of end customers and applications. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I have 2 quick ones on the cash return again. You talked about over the next 5 years getting up to 80%. How long does it actually take to ramp to that point? Is this something where we should really expect a step change or is this something that builds in? Second question just really quickly to save time, you talked about -- sounds like mostly dividends and opportunistic buybacks, but over the last few years, it's been primarily dividends. It sounds like you're going to focus on that still. So does the increase in the cash return of what you're talking about really imply a very significant increase in dividends. Is that really how we should be thinking about this in terms of what's driving the cash return? David A. Zinsner Yes, so I wouldn't look at 80% as we're going to try to ramp up to 80%. We're going to try to average 80% over a 5-year period. Some quarters that's going to mean it's going to be plus 80%, some quarters, it might be below 80%. But the average is supposed to be 80%. I don't think next quarter it will be 80%, although we're going to have to see. We haven't changed the approach we have towards buybacks. The buyback aspect of this thing is that we will buy when the historical price is above the current price by some measure. And that's what will trigger the buyback. It's somewhat -- it's to some extent on autopilot, I guess, and we'll just execute when and if those situations occur. My guess is they will occur and that will be a reasonable amount of the 80% free cash flow return. But it's true that the primary means of returning cash to shareholders is going to be dividends. Having said that, I wouldn't expect the dividend per se to ramp dramatically at a rate that's dramatically faster than earnings growth rates. It will, in all likelihood, be at a faster rate than earnings growth, but I don't think it's going to be too dramatic. And that's because we have an expectation that we will buy back stock. And that will be a part of the cash return and it will be a meaningful part of the cash return. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. But that would... David A. Zinsner We lost him. [Technical Difficulty] Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division You referred the low end of sales guidance being based on the possibility of macro weakening. Are you actually seeing any signs that there could be weakening as we go into the middle of the year? Or is this caveat just based on what we've seen in the last couple of years? David A. Zinsner This is strictly just caution around the just kind of macro side of things. And we have seen no evidence to suggest that. Clearly, we are modestly -- I guess, slightly influenced by what happened last year. Steve, do you want to squeeze that one in? Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Yes, as my follow-up question, I -- if I look at your -- there is a prior reference to converters, but if I look at amplifiers, I -- actually if you look at the year-on-year trend, they actually weakened last quarter. Is there anything fundamental that's driving the weakness? Is it tied to a particular segment such as communications? Can you help us understand that? Vincent T. Roche Well, let me -- it's very, very hard to ascribe the shift in a quarter to any one particular segment or any particular application area. I think overall as a company, we have strong share and we play in the high-performance amplifier area. And I think you have to really look at our share over a long period of time. And just like in converters, these 2 areas form the core. These are ADI's backbone and we've actually been gaining share in the high-performance amplifier space over the last while. So I think looking at these numbers quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter, don't tell you anything because we have been gaining share. David A. Zinsner Yes, the other thing is that in some cases, this stuff is all integrating together and then we have to lump it in into something called other. It becomes an other category and so... Vincent T. Roche An identification issue. David A. Zinsner Yes, so a lot of times the functionality that was a standalone amplifier is not a standalone product anymore and so we kind of classify it in other. Ali Husain Great. Well, we're running out of time and well past the 6 o'clock hour. But, Vince, do you want to come back and do your closing remarks before we sign off here? Vincent T. Roche Sure. Well, firstly, I'd like to thank everybody for participating with us today here. So far we've discussed our results and our trends related to the industry, our markets and our shareholders. So in closing, I want to share with you what I've been discussing with our employees since I took over as President several months ago and what I continue to tell our employees as the CEO of the company. My primary focus is to accelerate ADI's growth. This world will emerge from the economic malaise that has dominated for the past 5 years or so, and when it does, my job and the job of other employees is to make sure that ADI emerges stronger and better. Our strength will be evidenced in the growth rate of our sales and the expansion of our operating profits, which generates earnings leverage and strong cash flow. The domain of signal processing, in which we lead, present an excellent growth opportunity in the years ahead as the world drives for more automation, greener energy, affordable health care, more connectivity and mobility. All of these trends face complex technical challenges, and we have a culture here at ADI that thrives on finding innovative ways to solve very complex problems for our customers. Many competitors also see these opportunities, but none of them have the breadth and depth of our signal processing engineering expertise and our customers also recognize us for this fact. We will focus on solving not only the complex problems, but also the critical problems. And this means we must continuously assess how we allocate our R&amp;D and actively steer investments toward areas where innovation creates the greatest momentum for ADI. More and more, I feel employees deepening their customer engagements, bringing the outside world into the company and defining and solving the critical problems before our competitors do. I firmly believe that engineering excellence, coupled with deep customer market insights, drive superior innovation and superior innovation drives superior results. So I, along with our 9,000 employees will settle for nothing less. So with that, I'd like to thank you, and wish you a good evening. Ali Husain Great. Thanks a lot, Vince, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Just a reminder that our Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call is scheduled for August 20, 2013, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time. So thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Good night and have a pleasant evening. Bye. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.

"content": "    NORWOOD, Mass.---- Analog Devices, Inc. , a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended May 5, 2012.   ADI produced solid results for the second quarter. Compared to the immediately prior quarter, revenue grew 4%, led by strong sales across a wide range of industrial applications, and also increased sales into communications infrastructure applications. Diluted EPS grew 15%, well ahead of revenue growth, as gross margin and operating income expanded by 200 and 320 basis points, respectively. Operating cash flow continued to be very strong at $226 million, or approximately 34% of sales, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. Order rates and backlog also grew compared to the prior quarter, which leads us to plan for continued sequential growth of revenue in the third quarter.   ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 12, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2012.   Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2012   Revenue totaled $675 million   Gross margin was 65.2% of revenue   Operating margin was 31.5% of revenue   Diluted EPS was $0.53   Cash flow from operations was $226 million, or 33.5% of revenue   Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.   Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2012   Revenue estimated to increase sequentially by approximately 1% to 4%   Gross margin estimated to increase sequentially by approximately 50 basis points   Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $231 million   Diluted EPS estimated at $0.54 to $0.58   Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET   ADI will host a conference call to discuss the second quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET.

Non-GAAP Financial Information for Fiscal Year 2011 Second Quarter   This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.   Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.   Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management uses non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.   Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures   The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Tax-Related Item. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, we recorded a one-time $10.8 million tax benefit for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.   Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors   Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.   Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Analog Devices  believes that non-GAAP diluted EPS has material limitations in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.   Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

"content": "    NORWOOD, Mass.---- Analog Devices, Inc. , a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended August 4, 2012.   ADI delivered solid results for the third quarter, with revenue increasing by 1% and diluted EPS increasing by 6% compared to the prior quarter. Profitability and cash flow remained strong, said Jerald G. Fishman, President and CEO. Given the economic headwinds and uncertainty in most regions, we were encouraged by consistent order patterns among customers and distributors and by the resilience of our large and broad-based industrial business, as well as the communications, automotive, and consumer end markets.   Mr. Fishman continued, As a result of higher opening backlog and stable order patterns, we are planning for sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We expect that revenue from the industrial, communications, and automotive end markets will be similar to third quarter levels, in line with typical seasonal patterns. We are expecting sequential revenue growth from our consumer customers as is typical in the fourth quarter and also as a result of a strong new product cycle. In aggregate, we are planning for revenue in the range of $685 million to $715 million for the fourth quarter.   ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on September 12, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2012.   Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2012   Revenue totaled $683 million   Gross margin was 65.6% of revenue   Operating margin was 32% of revenue, excluding restructuring-related expenses   Diluted EPS was $0.56   Cash flow from operations was $138 million, or 20% of revenue   Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.   Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2012   The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases   Revenue estimated at $685 million to $715 million   Gross margin estimated to be approximately 65%   Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $231 million   Diluted EPS estimated at $0.54 to $0.60   Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET   ADI will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone    A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to one week by dialing 855-859-2056  and providing the conference ID:17192535, or by visiting investor.analog.com.   Non-GAAP Financial Information   This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.   Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.   Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.   Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures   The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Restructuring-Related Expenses. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Tax-Related Item. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a one-time $3.4 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.   Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors   Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.   Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Analog Devices  believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.   Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements made by us. Important factors that may affect future operating results include: sovereign debt issues globally, any faltering in global economic conditions or the stability of credit and financial markets, erosion of consumer confidence and declines in customer spending, unavailability of raw materials, services, supplies or manufacturing capacity, changes in geographic, product or customer mix, adverse results in litigation matters, and other risk factors described in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our results of operations for the periods presented in this release are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future periods.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

"content": "    NORWOOD, Mass.---- Analog Devices, Inc. , a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2013, which ended February 2, 2013.   Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2013   Revenue totaled $622.1 million   Gross margin was 62.7% of revenue   Operating margin was 26.9% of revenue, excluding special items, and was 24.7% on a GAAP basis   Diluted EPS was $0.44, excluding special items, and was $0.42 on a GAAP basis   Cash flow from operations was $158 million, or 25.4% of revenue   Results for the first quarter were within the range we communicated and represented a generally weak macroeconomic environment exacerbated by year-end inventory reductions at many customers. Nevertheless, our operating performance remained strong, as we carefully managed our business to balance the long term opportunities for ADI with the realities of current market conditions, said Jerald G. Fishman, CEO. In January, order rates began to improve across most markets and geographies and have remained strong so far this quarter. As a result, we are planning for solid revenue growth in our second quarter, in the range of 4-8% sequentially with significant operating leverage.   ADI also announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 13 percent increase in its regular quarterly dividend, from $0.30 to $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 12, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2013.   Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. The first quarter of fiscal year 2012 was a 14-week period. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.   Outlook for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2013   The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.   Revenue estimated to increase in the range of 4% to 8% sequentially   Gross margin estimated to be approximately 64%   Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $224 million   Tax rate estimated to be approximately 17%   Diluted EPS estimated at $0.49 to $0.55   Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET   ADI will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone .   A replay will be available two hours after the completion of the call. The replay may be accessed for up to two weeks by dialing 855-859-2056  and providing the conference ID: 92068413, or by visiting investor.analog.com.   Non-GAAP Financial Information   This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.   Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.   Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.   Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures   The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Restructuring-Related Expenses. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Tax-Related Item. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, the Company recorded a $6.3 million tax benefit related to the reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit in January 2013, retroactive to January 1, 2012. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.   Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors   Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.   Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Analog Devices  believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.   Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

With that, lets begin with the opening remarks from our CEO, Jerry Fishman. Jerry Fishman Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today on todays second quarter earnings call. As you can tell from the press release we put out earlier the second quarter was just a great quarter for ADI. Our revenues grew about 11% sequentially, 41% year-over-year to $668 million which is above our recent peak we achieved in 2008.  Our earnings per share grew at a rate more than three times the rate of revenue growth for a record $0.55 per share for the quarter. As we described to many of our investors at the beginning of last year, we set a goal to fundamentally improve ADIs operating model and obviously we have made significant progress towards achieving that goal. In the second quarter our gross margins reached record levels increasing 390 basis points sequentially to 65% and our operating margins ran up to 32% which is over 700 basis points higher than our recent peak.  Because of our strong financial performance and our very strong cash flow our board has approved a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend to now $0.22 per share. Our industrial revenues were particularly strong and increased by over 20% sequentially as industrial activity picked up worldwide. Automotive revenues also increased substantially. Consumer and communications revenues were approximately flat sequentially. Revenues increased overall in the United States, Europe and Asia and declined slightly in Japan. I will elaborate a little bit more on the end markets and some of the trends in each of the markets after Dave discusses the financial results in a bit more detail.  I think very importantly we continue to be recognized in the industry as the premier analog supplier. In January Huawei, one of Chinas top telcom companies and one of our largest customers awarded ADI their Golden Core Supplier Award to ADI for delivering superior performance, technology, quality, responsiveness and in delivery. In March one of the industrial automation leaders, Rockwell, named ADI the Electronics Supplier of the Year for 2009. It is very noteworthy that ADI was the only semiconductor company to be recognized with this award from Rockwell.  These are just two examples of the recognition we are receiving across our customer base for our innovative signal processing solutions that give our customers a very significant competitive advantage coupled with our superior customer service and responsiveness to our customers needs.  Now I am going to turn the call over to Dave Zinsner who will provide a little more detail about our financial results.  Dave Zinsner  Thanks Jerry. As Jerry mentioned revenues in the second quarter grew 11% sequentially and 41% from the same quarter last year to $668 million. We responded to the significant increases in demand over the past few quarters while keeping our lead times short.  During the second quarter we shipped nearly 100% of our orders from direct customers within 4-8 weeks and nearly 90% of our orders from distributors within 4-8 weeks. This is similar to our lead times during the first quarter for OEM customers and only slightly longer for distributors where our ordering patterns tend to be more volatile.  In our view our ability to deliver quickly and reliably has three significant benefits. First, we believe in the current environment our lead times are winning us cross over business from competitors. Second, we believe over the long term ADI will continue to gain share since customers are confident in ADIs ability to meet its commitments to them in a volatile environment. Lastly, we believe that ADIs short and steady lead times should reduce the likelihood of double ordering that typically results from extended lead times providing us a somewhat more accurate picture of end demand.  Gross margins for the second quarter increased to 65%, up 390 basis points sequentially and also up 390 basis points from the last time our revenues were in the $660 million range which was during the fourth quarter of 2008. This margin increase is primarily the result of lower manufacturing costs derived from the manufacturing consolidations we completed last year, higher manufacturing utilization and to a lesser degree our richer mix of higher margin products used in industrial applications.  Our inventory levels remain within our stated range of 90-100 days at 97 days cost of sales, up only $4 million sequentially. Our distributor days of inventory declined slightly. At approximately 8 weeks it continues to be healthy and at historically low levels. Our deferred income on shipments to distributors is up approximately 17% sequentially reflecting much higher sales in distribution combined with significantly higher gross margins which further increased our deferred income.  Internal fab utilization rose about 10 percentage points to approximately the low 70s of production rated capacity. In line with better than expected revenue growth we have raised our capital spending plans slightly to approximately $95 million for the year. Longer term we can add substantial capacity to existing clean rooms if needed with a relatively low level of additional capital equipment.  Operating expenses were $220 million with the most significant increases in variable compensation driven by significantly higher operating margins and also higher sales commissions. Operating expense as a percentage of sales have declined from 36.3% at the end of fiscal 2008 to 33% of sales in the second quarter as we are now operating the business with 7% less non-manufacturing personnel. In addition, our strategy has been to increase the percentage of our operating expenses that are variable so we can more effectively modulate these expenses in response to future business cycles.  Operating margins increased to 32% of revenues. The last time our revenues were at current levels operating margins were less than 25% of sales. 720 basis points lower than in our recently completed quarter. This quarters substantially higher operating margins are partly due to an improving business environment but equally important our results reflect the actions we have taken over the past few years to better focus our investments and improve our execution and our cost structure.  Our tax rate was 21.9% which was up from 20.3% last quarter as we now estimate our annual tax rate to be 21.3% excluding the effect of restructuring expenses. We have also carefully managed our working capital. In addition to keeping our inventory within our stated range, day sales outstanding has remained in check at 45 days despite a tighter credit environment worldwide.  Cash flow from operations totaled $278 million or 42% of revenues and free cash flow was $261 million or 39% of revenues. Our cash balance now totals approximately $2.4 billion or $2 billion net of debt which is more than $200 million higher than the previous quarter and more than $700 million higher than the previous year.  In summary, by every financial and business metric this was a very successful quarter for ADI. I will now turn the call back over to Jerry who will discuss the results from each of the end markets.  Jerry Fishman  For the third consecutive quarter now we see strong sequential growth from the industrial market. For this quarter industrial revenues grew about 20% sequentially to about $316 million which is a very positive sign for recovery in this broad and diversified industry group.  The growth in the second quarter was primarily driven by growth in the industrial automation and instrumentation markets but every application area within the industrial category also showed sequential improvement. All regions had good growth in industrial products with particular strength in industrial products in Europe and in North America.  Our revenues from our automotive customers were approximately $84 million for the quarter which was up 14% quarter-over-quarter. Although certainly the growth of the automotive industry has been helped to some degree by the stimulus programs, feedback from many of our automotive customers indicating their belief that improving overall demand has also been the result of the gradual and steady improvement in consumer confidence.  Further ADI technology is most relevant to higher end cars which have not been the primary beneficiary of most government stimulus programs. Finally, we continue to see very favorable macro trends for ADI within the automotive space including safety, fuel efficiency and convenience, all of which drive higher dollar content for ADI.  Our communications revenues at about $133 million for the quarter were down very slightly from Q1. Networking applications, optical, microwave and satellite increases were offset by a decline in wireless revenues primarily as a result of delays in base station programs in China. For Q3 based on current ordering patterns and the backlog we have in place we expect growth from our Chinese base station customers. European and U.S. base station sales increased during the second quarter.  The wire line market had its fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement delivering good return on the very significant investments that we have made over the past few years in applications such as optical communications and also cable. This quarter revenues from wired communication applications were up approximately 20% sequentially. Revenues from the consumer market were about $120 million which was up a couple of percent from the previous quarter but up about 45% from last year.  We saw a particular strength in the digital camera and portable media markets and our customers today are indicating consumers are once again buying these types of products. In the computing sector our revenues increased 15% sequentially which still represents only a modest 2% of our total revenues.  The new orders for the quarter were again very strong in the second quarter. As a result of backlog for shipment in the third quarter increased from both OEM customers and distribution end customers and the book to bill ratio for the quarter was well above 1. Looking ahead to the third quarter given a higher backlog we are expecting continued revenue growth.  We are currently planning for our revenues to be in the range of $695-715 million for the third quarter. We expect this growth to be fairly broad based and that is based on our customer forecasts and the opening backlog we had starting this quarter. We are planning for our gross margins to be in a range of 65-66%. We are expecting operating expenses to grow as a result of higher variable comp as the operating margins continue to expand. The quarter OpEx growth is planned to be well below our anticipated revenue growth in the third quarter giving us additional leverage in the third quarter.  As a result we anticipate our operating margins will expand to the 33-34% range and earnings per share should be in a range of $0.59 to $0.61. Obviously we are very pleased with our operating performance both in terms of our growth and our profitability in the second quarter. We have fundamentally and significantly improved our operating margin structure at ADI without sacrificing sales growth opportunities which has been our goal for the past few years as we sharpened our strategic focus and we reduced costs company-wide.  We believe we still have additional leverage ahead of us as we fully recognize the benefits of lower unit costs, continue to experience good price stability in most of our products and we limit expense growth to a fraction of sales growth and continue to develop very innovative products that help our customers gain share in the markets they serve and command good margins. While the external world of course remains uncertain we are today a fundamentally better and a fundamentally stronger company than a few years ago. We believe as we continue to demonstrate world-class financial returns and above market growth our shareholders will be the beneficiary ultimately of this success.  Mindy Kohl  Thank you Jerry. During todays Q&amp;A period please limit yourself to one primary question and no more than one follow-on question. We will give you another opportunity to ask additional questions if we have time remaining. Operator, we are now ready for questions from our analyst participants.    Question and Answer Session Operator  The first question comes from the line of Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech.  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech As much as I hate to ask the hypothetical question, you mentioned in your commentary the company has increased its flexibility to the spending the company does in regards to the cycle. With these stocks not really able to get moving here it is clear that people recognize business is strong but my question really is hypothetically if you were to see revenues decline by 10% what impact would that have to the earnings potential for the company?  Dave Zinsner  I dont think I want to go right into the measuring because it depends on mix and things like that. I can tell you what we have done is changed the balance of the OpEx between what is variable and what is fixed. So as revenues if they were to decline we have an ability to maintain a lot more of the profits to the P&amp;L and hopefully keep the margin relatively balanced.  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech If you could focus on one segment you think you are seeing much better than expected demand from, not really customers trying to do an inventory rebuild. Where is it that the demand is surprising you to the upside?  Jerry Fishman  I would say probably the place it has been the strongest are in the industrial and automotive side. At least for this part of the seasonal lift. Typically our second quarter is a strong industrial quarter but I think the industrial part of the business has recovered quicker than we would have expected. It is above where it was at the peak of the last cycle but not by that much and it is spread out amongst so many customers, in that space probably 10,000 plus customers, so I dont think there is a broad inventory accumulation cycle going on.  That business was down very substantially last year, well over 30%, and I think what has happened is when we talk to the large customers; the Rockwells in the U.S. and their counterparts in Europe and China, I think they are seeing the fact their factories are running higher than they did and their inventory levels have been very low. I think they are predicting this is not really a bubble. You never know, as you well know, about what your customers are really doing but we dont get a lot of sense from the large customers that they are stockpiling inventory here.  It would be very surprising on a customer base as broad as this both by product, customer and geography that all of these customers would be acting in unison to build inventory. I think they are recovering some of the inventory that they depressed but I think they are ordering commensurate with what they think their outlook is at least for the next six months. As we look at the third quarter we are predicting that industrial revenues will grow again.  We have looked at this from the large customers, small customers, distributors and at least the sense we get fairly broadly across the board is that business has recovered quicker than we would have thought but not to levels we would have predicted they would recover to. The automotive stuff is the part that there is obviously some of that stimulus stuff which could [have] more people buying cars but I dont think at least what we hear from our guys that run that business that a huge amount of the increases we have seen are due to that. Most of our products as I mentioned in my opening comments are in the higher end cars. That is not going to benefit too much from the stimulus stuff. But our content for each car and safety stuff and sensors, and all the products we have been working on for a couple of years is just much higher than it was a couple of years ago.  We dont have a sense of automotive companies stockpiling inventory either. First of all, I dont think they want to. Secondly, I dont think they have the cash to. Those are the two segments probably that have surprised us most on the upside.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates. Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the com business in more detail. As I look back over the past number of years it seems sort of flattish dollar wise. Maybe some classification changes there or something. You obviously said there was some 20% growth there in the wire line business but overall it still is sort of flattish. Can you talk about how that might roll out over the coming year? Do you think we can see better growth going forward out of that?  Jerry Fishman  This is in communications?  Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates Overall communications.  Jerry Fishman  I think you know that business is obviously a very large customer business and when one customer does well often you see that customer flatten it out for awhile. Clearly the part we were really disappointed in this quarter was a few of our large customers in China we actually saw a decline this quarter which was anomalous to that business mainly because there was some well publicized push outs in China capital spending in the communications business. I think as we go forward we have looked at the order book pretty carefully particularly over the last month or so. Based on the orders we have on the books from our customers in China we expect we are going to have third quarter be a good growth quarter in the business in China.  Even during all of the ups and downs in the wireless market over the last couple of quarters the non-[China] business has continued to grow. So I mean we have a very solid position. We are the largest market share holder in Asia, Europe and the United States. If anything I think our share is better than it was 2-3 years ago. So I think as that business ebbs and flows with capital spending and inventory cycles with those customers I think the wireless communications part of the business is going to continue to be a good growth driver for us in the coming years.  It tends to be a little lumpy for sure but what I tend to pay attention to the most is the feedback we are getting from the customers about our position, how we are doing. The award we got from Huawei was a great substantiation of the fact we have an enormously strong position and one of the strongest players in the base station business in the world. We also have very strong positions in other very significant players; Ericsson and [inaudible]. So I think we have a very good balance and we have a very strong position which is going to continue to have that business be a good business for us a long time in the future if we keep executing.  Steve Smige Raymond James &amp; Associates You took the dividend up. Obviously feeling a lot better about cash flow. I think you had raised some debt to maybe ensure that back when things were pretty ugly. I am curious now that cash flow is obviously better and you are taking up the dividend, will you also choose to pay down the debt or do you keep that for awhile? Can you talk to that?  Dave Zinsner  We have a few years yet before we have to decide on the debt. At this point we have plenty of cash in the U.S. and we have plenty of cash worldwide and so we are certainly not in need of any cash. The focus of the dividend was really to represent what we think is a very strong cash flow model for the company going forward and we seek to provide some of that back to the shareholders in the form of a dividend.  Jerry Fishman  I think also the debt is very low cost. We swapped it to floating rates which turned out to be at least for now a good thing to do. So the net cost for that debt is extremely low. We havent decided but it is not a high priority for us right now.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities.  Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities On the gross margin in terms of Q2 do you expect your utilization rate to increase as well? In terms of the long-term operating model you highlighted at your analyst day it looks going into Q2 you will be above the high end of the range. Is there any change in your mind in terms of the longer-term operating model? How should we think about that evolving over the next year or so?  Jerry Fishman  I think as far as utilization, utilization will bump up slightly in the quarter. As far as long-term models lets get to where we said we were going to get to first and then we will talk about that some more. We are obviously very optimistic about our prospects going forward but I would like to see another quarter before we get into that conversation.  Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities In the supply chain inventory it sounds like things are still a little bit on the lean side. Are there any end markets or areas where you are seeing inventories at a normal level?  Jerry Fishman  At a normal or abnormal?  Shawn Webster Macquarie Securities At a normal level just because it seems like a lot of areas are a little bit on the lean side.  Jerry Fishman  I really dont know that enough to be definitive in a comment on that. Most of the comments we get about inventory from our customers are anecdotal. The inventories we really understand the best are what is in distribution but beyond distribution we dont know where it is going. So it is very hard to answer that question accurately and definitively.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely JP Morgan.  Christopher Danely JP Morgan A different way to ask that question, can you give us a sense of what utilization rates are and maybe what the incremental gross margin is as the utilization rates go higher?  Dave Zinsner  The current utilization for the second quarter was in the low 70s. I think I even mentioned that. It likely will be going into the mid 70s so not a significant increase in utilization but that is going to be a benefit to our gross margins. Really the bigger driver for gross margins I think in the next quarter is going to be additional cost reductions associated with the fab consolidations.  Christopher Danely JP Morgan In terms of the strength in the industrial and auto in particular what would you describe would be the major factors of the strength? Do you think there is still some inventory replenishment out there? Is it share gains? Is it increasing content? Is it a mix of all three? Is there something else in there? Maybe highlight one or two of the biggest factors you think are driving that.  Jerry Fishman  I think it is all of those things probably in some ratio we dont really know definitively. One of the interesting things and we talked about this a little at the analyst meeting we had a couple of months ago is there are some new segments in the industrial area that are growing pretty rapidly that we are very well penetrated in. I think I also mentioned that or the [guy] who runs our industrial business mentioned that his goal is he really believes the industrial market could provide as much or more growth than any other market segment we are in given the growth rates in some of these segments.  I think the old story that the industrial market was a [sweet deal] market and it is going to grow 2% a year, the real excitement is in cell phones and consumer products is the only place with any growth I think it is going to turn out to be fallacious.  I think there is significant opportunities in the industrial business and I think also the automotive business where just the electronics changing and just more and more signal processing content in automotive products and industrial products and there is great opportunities for growth there just like there are in every other market segment. I think when history is written, at least for ADI, we are making our investments in the industrial or the automotive business, I am not speaking broadly for all semiconductor companies but just for ADI I think it will turn out the industrial business does hold its own relative to anything else we are doing on the growth side.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank.  Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank  A question on the gross margin side. You mentioned some of the lower costs from the fab closures was in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how much that added in the April quarter and how much is left as we go forward?  Dave Zinsner  It was meaningful. It has been meaningful now for the last few quarters. It is a combination of the consolidation of the 6 inch line in Limerick into the 8 inch which we completed midway through last year. At the end of the year we closed down Cambridge and we are already starting to see some benefit. We saw some benefit in the second quarter. We will see more benefit in the third quarter. Those are the things that are really the big drivers of our gross margin leverage right now.  Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank  I believe in the past you talked about the Cambridge side was about $40 million in savings. Do you have any kind of rough ballpark how much of that you have already seen and how much is left to be benefited from?  Dave Zinsner  Rough order of magnitude I think we have got roughly about 1/3 of it. There is probably 2/3 left.  Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank  On the revenue side of the equation everybody is clearly nervous about too much inventory and things have been good for awhile to come. Can you talk about the turns you did in the April quarter and any sort of turns assumption you have whether it is increasing or decreasing in conservatism for your July quarter guidance?  Dave Zinsner  One thing you have to remember is when we are looking at backlog we are looking at backlog placed on us. So the distributor backlog tends to not be a great measure. So we have to kind of, we do a lot of different analysis to come up with a number that we predict for revenue. We hardly ever look at this number I would tell you. But it ran a little less than 40% in the second quarter. It is probably going to be a little bit even lower than that. We are getting a fair amount of visibility obviously from our distributors.  Jerry Fishman  The opening backlog is up quite a bit. I think as Dave said the backlog distributors place on here is not indicative of anything. So we dont really, I mean look at that very carefully. We look at what distributors are actually selling through and we look at what the large OEM customers are telling us and that is how we come up with the guidance.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen Citigroup.  Terence Whalen Citigroup On the device revenue performance it seems like you had very strong performances from amplifiers and RF as well as from power management and some of the other analog signal processing circuits. It seems like data converters grew a little bit less, about 5% sequentially. I was wondering what contributed to that? Was it end market mix? Do you have any observations in general about the data converter market competition?  Dave Zinsner  One thing you might not want to misread is just one quarters performance in data converter. Data converters has been up every quarter since the second quarter of last year sequentially. So where some of these other product areas have kind of been up and down a little bit through the year, data converters had very, very steady improvement since Q2 of last year. So I think on a peak to trough or peak to peak analysis or what have you, you will see that data converters is actually doing really well.  Jerry Fishman  On the question on the competition, I think there is a lot of competition out there. It is a great market and we have 40 plus percent of it and everybody wants it. There are a lot of people that have been investing a lot in the converter market and so on. I think when you look at all the statistics and you listen to the customers which are the ultimate statistic I think that is a great business and it is probably one of the best market segments in the analog space. It is one of the very few that the shares are concentrated as it is in the converter market. There is every bit of evidence our share over the last couple of years has gone up despite all of the competitive noise out there and it is certainly the highest priority we have is to keep that high or even increase it in future quarters. I think based on what I have seen we are doing in that business I think we have a good chance of doing that.  Terence Whalen Citigroup Regarding your commentary about distributor inventory I think the past three quarters you have said it is about 8 weeks. You said it went down actually fractionally but not enough to be a half week or so. Can you kind of help me understand that comment in light of the deferred income to distribution at 17%? I know if I normalize for gross margin that comes out to only about a 10% growth. Am I to understand that distributor revenues grew over 10% sequentially to drive distributor days down?  Dave Zinsner  Distributor revenues were higher than the corporate average and OEM was lower than the corporate average. You are correct. That is what drove it.  Terence Whalen Citigroup In general, the level of distribution inventory, do you expect that to have to go up at some point or is this the new normal?  Dave Zinsner  I think they are trying to keep it within that kind of 8 week range. It slipped a little bit and that is based on just the fact they have been ramping and so there is a little bit of a lag to keep pace with that.  Jerry Fishman  I think we are also trying to keep it in that range. We have an interest in not putting too much inventory in the channel. When we get orders placed on us which are not things we look at very closely we have a lot of dialogue with those distributors about, what is the sell through, why do you want it, so on and so forth. I think we have a very significant stake in keeping our inventories at reasonable levels. We dont get any revenue credit for it but we would confuse everybody if we dont do that. By the way, capacity is more scarce [inaudible] so the last thing we want to do is use capacity to just put inventory on distributor shelves beyond what their sell through is. We just dont do that.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Jim Covello Goldman Sachs.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs I want to drill down even a bit further on the gross margin thing that I know has been probed on a little bit. I know Dave you talked about utilization and you made the comments of where it is and where it is going. Then you said about 1/3 of the last fab closure is baked into the numbers and 2/3 is still to come. Can you give us a sense of how much maybe on a basis point impact that 2/3 left is having on the margins? Then I think Jerry mentioned pricing is the other margin leverage in his closing comments. Do you need prices to go up to have margin leverage or are your costs coming down enough so if prices stay flat or only go down a little bit there is incremental margin leverage there as well?  Dave Zinsner  There is still about 100 basis points of benefit still coming from fab closures.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Is that all coming in the next quarter or is that to be spread out over the next couple of quarters?  Dave Zinsner  Spread out probably over a couple of quarters.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs The pricing leverage?  Jerry Fishman  We always watch pricing. We have very high value added products and we are always in the mode of making sure we get paid for the product commensurate with the value they create. We are not anticipating wholesale price increases to maintain or improve our margins across the board. We always have opportunities on older products and so on to think about that because we are one of the very few or only company that supports semiconductor products for 20 years or more after we introduce them, which is a great value to our customers.  I think the direct answer to your question is we are not anticipating any significant price increases to either maintain or raise our margins.  Jim Covello Goldman Sachs Relative to the power management business that is something that got discussed quite a bit maybe 9-12 months ago. Obviously with the business being so robust now maybe there is not as much urgency for kind of new growth opportunities. But where is your head on that potential avenue for growth looking forward?  Jerry Fishman  I think it is still good. The whole challenge for ADI in the power business has been to focus on areas where we really have unique stuff. We have gone through a metamorphosis a year or two ago to better focus it towards particularly applications where we already have a very significant control of the billed materials.  I think the group out there has responded well to that and I think we have begun already to see the benefits of better focus in that business. It improved significantly last quarter. One quarter does not make a business one way or the other but I think there are a lot of indicators in there that if we focus, I mean we are not taking on the broad power business trying to compete across a $7 billion with entrenched competitors. We are looking for opportunities where we can do something unique and where we have a large control over the billed materials. I think if we do that and we stay true to that strategy I think we will do very well in that business.  Operator The next question comes from the line of John Pitzer Credit Suisse.  John Pitzer Credit Suisse  I guess I am going to go back to a comment I think Jerry made in the opening comments about your short lead times allowing you to gain some market share. I was hoping you could quantify that a little bit. Is that the main driver why some of the other businesses outside of converters grew more quickly sequentially? Are those share gains you think sustainable?  Jerry Fishman  I would say quarter-to-quarter it is very hard to make that judgment. I think the [crossover] business is not significant relative to our total sales but it is significant I think relative to our reputation. So I think the more important victory here, if there is one, is customers come to us and we can supply the stuff. Certainly the conversations we have had with our sales force is we wouldnt expect to be losing that business when other competitors start to deliver again. There is no reason for that. I think a lot of that business is going to stick and I think it is going to increase in future quarters.  It is not meaningful relative to $650-700 million of sales but it is very relevant to the perception of Analog as a supplier. I think that is the more important take away from this.  John Pitzer Credit Suisse  Going back to the deferred shipment line, understanding you need to adjust that sequential growth number for gross margins but even when I do that you are still kind of back to peak revenue levels but deferred shipments are above that level. Just help me understand why I shouldnt be worried that is some sort of yellow flag that there might be some inventory building. Is there a change in the business where you are just going to be running with higher deferred shipments going forward? How would you expect that to trend over the next few quarters?  Dave Zinsner  One thing you have to remember is that the cost of the inventory being held at distribution is not necessarily the same. In other words, the gross margins arent exactly the same change for the total company as they are for that. So, the gross margin has actually improved a bit more at the disti level than they did for the total company over the peak to peak period of time. So that is driving a lot of it. I think you will find, and I am pretty sure when I did the analysis that the days of inventory are actually lower than they were by a good 10 days or so from the Q4 2008 period. We have pretty good accurate assessments of that.  John Pitzer Credit Suisse  So it is all being driven just by better profitability on your part?  Dave Zinsner  That, plus I think that disti is now back to levels where they are shipping at a fairly decent rate.  Jerry Fishman  It turns out companies like Analog the distribution margins are usually higher because the volumes we ship out are much lower and the customer base is much more fragmented. That is the more profitable part of our business. It is also the part that services the industrial market mostly. All those things add up to the fact that business tends to be higher margins than anything else we do.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company.  Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Cycling back to gross margin, nice tailwinds in utilization and in factory shutdown and consolidation activity. Are there any headwinds at play? For example, last year consumer grew at well above average rate in the second half of the year. Anything like that going on?  Dave Zinsner  Our anticipation is that mix will impact the third quarter by a little bit but mix in either direction quarter-to-quarter tends to be well below a point and we have enough things going the other direction in terms of utilization and cost reductions that we are able to offset those and more. We are not very concerned about gross margins and our ability to get leverage.  Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company A utilization related question, I think we would typically expect analog companies to run at utilization levels in the low to mid 80s and the company is moving back towards the mid 70s but how do you look at utilization here? Do you view it as something that can move up and be run in the mid 80s percent range or is there a reason we should expect ADIs utilization level to really hover in the mid 70s range?  Jerry Fishman  I think it has the opportunity to move up a little bit. As Dave said we have increased capital spending slightly to make sure we are right about this. I think the important take away on that is for relatively small amounts of incremental capital we can add capacity both cheaply and quickly. So the capacity additions we are putting on are really incremental in nature. Our goal is to keep our lead times low and that is what we are going to do in the absence of something cataclysmic happening on the top line on the upside, that is where we are going to be.  Craig Ellis Caris &amp; Company Is the incremental spending on the capital side, the uptick in guidance for the year on the front end or the back end or both?  Jerry Fishman  It is both. We are incrementally making more investments to get more internal wafers out. We are also making investments in back end equipment to make sure we get the [wafers] out we can test them and go on. So it is really across the board. Again, for a company that is running $2.7 or $2.8 billion still our capital plan is below $100 million this year. I think we have become a lot less capital intensive and we can make given the footprint we have in our fabs we can make incremental investments and get a lot more unit growth out of there.  Operator The next question comes from the line of David Wong Wells Fargo.  David Wong Wells Fargo I know you dont want to give explicit guidance beyond the June quarter but can you help us understand the seasonality in the September quarter? If we look back several years in some years September is a decline sequentially and in other years it grows. Specifically can you give us a feel for what proportion of your revenues today come from end markets that seasonally decline in the September quarter?  Jerry Fishman  I think your comment earlier is probably one of [inaudible]. It is very challenging to figure out precise seasonality when the markets are so volatile. I dont think we have any better read on seasonally what happens in Q4 compared to the rest of the year. So we just dont know enough. Some years, as you say, go up and in some years they go down. Six months out we just dont have a good sense of what is going to drive that. The only thing we typically know is that our second quarter is usually our seasonally strongest quarter because it is more days in distribution than our first quarter which has holidays.  But beyond that it bounces around year to year based on mix, based on seasonality, based on inventory levels, based on so many things it is just very, very hard to predict and I think that is why we dont predict it.  David Wong Wells Fargo To try another question with the elephant in the room, any signs of any weakening in demand from European end markets at this point?  Jerry Fishman  No.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research.  Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research On OpEx, now that you are at basically back or exceeding previous peak revenue levels would it be fair to say at this point that all of the temporary OpEx cuts you were discussing before have now returned and all of the permanent cuts at this point have actually been completed? Are you basically at the right OpEx model you have been targeting? Are there any more I guess further, is there any more further fat I guess to take out?  Jerry Fishman  We are at the model we put out at about 33% of sales. As I think Dave or I mentioned in the coming quarters we are planning to grow OpEx a lot less than our record assuming the revenues come through that we expect. So I think we will get some more OpEx leverage in future quarters. I think the thing that is noteworthy on the OpEx line is we have long had a plan at Analog that incented all of our employees to get our operating margins up quite a bit. What you have seen is the rise in OpEx over the last couple of quarters is primarily the result of that success.  It is not a trivial exercise to put on 700 points of operating leverage from last time we were at these kinds of levels. I think the pressure continues to keep moving the margins up at the company. The payback for employees doing that has been quite high. Of course the margin has been on a very steep incline. Even though we expect the margins to improve in future quarters we dont expect or at least we are not anticipating to add another 700 basis points on the margins in the short-term.  I think certainly the rate of acceleration of that is going to go down quite a bit. We are going to try and control the OpEx to a fraction of revenue growth rate. So the answer to your question is we still think we have more OpEx leverage coming up in the future.  Stacy Rasgon Bernstein Research A quick follow-up on the RF business. I know the amplifier and RF business looks like it was up quite considerably, about 16% quarter-over-quarter. My understanding was a fair amount of the RF piece of this was actually the communication infrastructure. It looks like it was down a little bit. I know this was a big, key strategic focus of yours that you talked about on the analyst day. Could you just give us a little bit of color on what you are seeing in the RF business in particular I guess in light of where it was in this quarter and also maybe outlook for the year?  Jerry Fishman  I think it is a great business for us. In the case of the analyst meeting we heard more in detail of the applications. It turns out it is a fair amount of RF in the wire line side of the business as well as the wireless side of the business and in other segments as well. I think we have a very broad product base in RF. We have great technology. The feedback we are getting from the customers in terms of growth and roadmaps to the future is very strong. I think that is going to be a very important business for us and we are doing extremely well at it right now.  Operator The next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech.  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech If you look at the R&amp;D tax credit getting extended what impact would that have on the tax rate going forward?  Dave Zinsner  You mean if it was approved?  Doug Freedman Broadpoint AmTech Yes.  Dave Zinsner  It is a percentage or two.  Mindy Kohl  That concludes our Q&amp;A session. Thank you all for your participation.

"content": "  Do not worry if you have missed out on prior picks in the tech sector because I have another one for you. Like Microsoft Corp.  and International Business Machines Corp. , I expect this pick to outperform the S&amp;P 500 substantially. Since we picked it on Sept. 28, MSFT rose 10% while the S&amp;P 500 rose 7%. Since we picked it on August 17, IBM rose 14% while the S&amp;P 500 rose 12%. As detailed in our ETF report on the tech sector, tech stocks are far and away the most profitable. That sectors returns on invested capital  stand at 42.3%, which is more than double the S&amp;P500 at 17.4%. And this weeks stock pick of the week is no exception. Analog Devices Inc. , one of Decembers Most Attractive Stocks, boasts a 54% ROIC. And like all of our Most Attractive Stocks the company has:high and rising economic profits  and a cheap valuation. As shown in our free report on ADI, the companys ROIC  is in the top quintile of all the companies we cover and its economic earnings are growing faster then reported accounting earnings. During its last fiscal year, ADIs economic earnings rose by 283% while accounting earnings rose by only 187%. Digging through the financial footnotes, we found $15mm in non-operating/non-recurring charges that cause reported earnings to be understated.   At the same time, the stocks valuation implies that ADIs profits will decline by 10% and never grow again. In other words, the stock market is predicting a permanent decline of more than 10% in ADIs profits. Given that most investors are not aware that the companys operating profits are as strong as they are, the market is probably not giving ADI appropriate credit for its profitability. In summary, the market is setting the profit growth bar quite low for this stock.  HIDDEN GEMS: About $15 million in non-operating expenses  cause reported earnings to be understated. Our discounted cash flow analysis shows that ADIs current valuation  implies that the companys profits will decline by 10% and never grow again. The company grew its economic earnings by $283mm during its last fiscal year. Excess cash of $2,462.5mm or nearly 25% of its market cap In summary, ADI gets our very attractive stock rating because its economic earnings are strong and growing while its valuation implies economic earnings will decline permanently by 10%. ADI fits the risk/reward profile of a great stock to buy. Note: Stock pick of the week is updated every Tuesday.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices: A Solid, Long-Term Investment - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices, Inc.  engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in industrial, communication, computer, and consumer applications. The companys products convert real-world phenomena, such as light, sound, temperature, motion, and pressure into electrical signals. Its products are used in a range of electronic equipment. The company sells its products worldwide through direct sales force, third-party distributors, and independent sales representatives, as well as through its Web site. Analog Devices, Inc. was founded in 1965 and is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts. How Well Is the Company Growing? With every business we want to know if they are growing. Why would we put money into a business that is not growing? Over the last year, ADI has been just barely above industry average. Whereas the Industry as a whole has a sales growth rate of 38.4%, ADI came in at 40.8% so they are healthy and performing as expected. On a quarter to quarter basis looking at Net Income I guess one cannot complain at their performance even though they came in half of what the industry had in growth from first quarter comparisons. Since we were coming off a poor 2009, The Semiconductor- Broad Line industry had tremendous growth of 563.9% while ADI came in at 223%; only half the industry. Evidently, ADI has had more expenses than the industry average. It has cost more to make money than it has the other members of the industry. How Valuable Is the Stock?Click charts below to enlarge How does one know how valuable a stock is? Cash is King! If this is the case, we are going to see that ADI may not be the valued stock to purchase right now in this industry. When we think about value we have to think about the potential growth. How much potential? Something called the price to sales ratio gives us the best indicator of this. The more money a company has coming in through sales compared to how much working capital it has speaks volumes about its health. The lower the price/sales ratio, the healthier it is. ADI has a ratio of 3.91% and that is a whopping 29% higher than the Industry, which records a ratio of 2.90 Do they have what it takes to grow right now? The second most important thing we need to consider is how much money is flowing through this company as compared to its price. This is called the price to cash flow ratio. ADI again comes in much higher, showing that it has 50% less money flowing through the company compared to its price right now. Its price to cash flow ratio is 15.6% while the industry comes in at 10.10%. In the Industry as a whole, it does not appear that ADI would be the first choice of value to invest in presently.  Future Growth ADI has one huge advantage over its competitors in the analogue market worldwide. ADI has a market share of twice that of its nearest competitor. 2010 data converter revenue will likely increase by more than 20 percent from the previous year, and longer term estimates show that the market for converters should continue to experience an average annual growth rate of nine percent through 2015.; this bodes well for ADI. Since 2009 ADI has had nothing but upgrades from Analysts; this bodes well looking into long term growth for the company.  Technical Outlook On this weekly chart ADI looks very healthy for a long term investment. We are forming an Ascending Triangle which is a bullish formation that usually forms during an uptrend as a continuation pattern.   These patterns mostly tend to lean toward a bullish sentiment and acknowledge accumulation. As this pattern forms, we see a slight contraction in volume, and that is evident here. Indicators are all healthy in the bullish areas where they should be.  From a technical standpoint, ADI looks ready to break out into a long term growth pattern. It needs to break through that 31.90 resistance barrier that has plagued it throughout the year. This is what we would wait for before we look into a long term investment in the stock.  Summary From a growth perspective, ADI leads its industry and may be the reason that it does not grow as fast as others it competes with. This being said, short term, there may be better stocks to look at in the industry if one is looking for short term investments. But, if someone is looking for a long term investment, ADI is worth putting on ones watch list for a possible near term long play. Investing in the stock or a long term option play may be a great value here.Disclosure: Author long ADI Source: Analog Devices: A Solid, Long-Term Investment  SA.Pages.Article.handleDisclosures;      This article was sent to 1,088 people who get email alerts on .

Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference May 23, 2013 1:10 PM ETBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division All right. We'll go ahead and get started. My name is Blayne Curtis. I'm the analyst here at Barclays. Very happy to have with me Analog Devices. From the company, Dave Zinsner, VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer; as well as, Ali Husain, who many of you know from Investor Relations.   Question-and-Answer Session Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division So just to jump right in things, I mean, you just reported earnings 2 days ago, so maybe, Dave, it will be helpful to just kind of recap that a bit. The April quarter was essentially in line. The guidance was a bit muted, still seeing Analog growth. The rest of it, it is fairly flat. So maybe that would be a good entry. I think most of them know your business but maybe just step through kind of, just what do you think from the end market in the near-term here? David A. Zinsner Yes, okay. So last term -- wish I don't hit this mic. Last quarter was a pretty good quarter. It came in pretty much as expected. We thought we'd be somewhere between kind of 4% and 8% off then we finished kind of rate. We split the goal close and came in 6% up. Good strength in the industrial space, which is usually what happens in our second quarter, and good -- I think good progress on gross margins. We improved gross margins, improved operating margins back into the 30% range. So everything looked pretty good. We also did take inventory down, which if you go back to last year this time, there was kind of similar trajectory. One thing we did was we built inventory last year. This time -- this year, we decided to actually keep inventory relatively lean and as things pick up, we'll get the leverage when that happens. This quarter, I would say bookings in general, over the quarter, were very solid. But certainly, strengthened through the quarter and exited the quarter with very strong bookings. They were -- both our bookings as we measure it on us, which is basically our OEMs plus what the distributors order. And the orders, if you combine OEM and what the -- and customers order on distributors of our parts, both of those were up double digits. So that -- those are all good positive signs indicating some momentum. So as we kind of thought about our guidance, we thought given all those things and particularly we saw strength in industrial, we felt like there's a reasonable opportunity yet towards the higher end of the range we gave, which was kind of, we gave essentially flat to up 4%. So we thought that, that's as a reasonable scenario, which would indicate we'd be kind of closer to the top in the range. I think as we thought about the bottom end of the range, what kind of entered our mind was last year. Everything felt almost exactly the same last year and we worked hard a bit off-guard as things really started to slow down particularly in July. And we certainly get industrial data points but the thing that we really hang our guidance on is really bookings and how bookings are transpiring. And the difficulty we have is, we have very short lead times and so right now, customers are booking mainly for deliveries in June not into July. In July, it becomes this kind of like unknown entity out there that where we're not really sure how things are going to go. So we thought well if a scenario transpire, which is momentum continues and at some point in anticipation of summer shutdowns or what have you, July really weakens. We ought to have that as that be our kind of our downside scenario and that's what kind of led us into this kind of flattish on the downside. At this point, there's not any evidence to suggest that, that's going to happen but out of abundance precaution more than anything, that was why we gave that kind of range. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division It is a clearly the data if you look at your guidance up almost 2%. And if you look back historical trends, it does seem more seasonal than not, or more normal than not, and I guess when you look at the remainder of the year, seasonality industrial is weaker in Q4 and better in the first half. The big debate is this year, normal or is this the new level or are we seeing something different this year? And I mean, do you have any indications that other end markets, and I think that most of you will get to networking but I think if you're hopeful. What will make this different than last? David A. Zinsner Well I think if you guide -- under our guide where the midpoint is kind of up 2%, that I think you're right. That is kind of normal seasonality although quite honestly, that's an average of 5 years of things going really gangbusters or not or going into the toilet. So there's been only I think one year where we actually did do up 2%. I think that was last year. So I think on the industrial side, we -- assuming that the macro doesn't fall apart on us. I think we have a pretty good deal that there's some momentum. Having said that, I wouldn't call it kind of a recovery momentum. I'd call it, our customers are being very cautious but demand is picking up modestly and so they're ordering very modestly, it's that kind of scenario for industrial. Hopefully, at some point, we get kind of a real robustness. People start spending capital for factories and buy industrial equipment and so forth. And those things really start to kind of pull the industrial business up and that would be the kind of the characteristics of a real recovery. On the comp side, as you point out, we guided flat communications and although we kind of hang out a little carried, which was orders in the last couple of weeks for comps did tick up. And I think trying to take 2 weeks and extrapolate that out and say, Okay, that things are back to the rate they probably -- we've done that many times internally and that usually ends up being a disaster. I think at this point now there's limited to no visibility as to how carriers are going to deploy equipment and what's going to happen to our OEMs and thus what's going to happen to us, in terms of deliveries and comp space. But I think that's still pretty much a wait-and-see game for us and at this point, there's no indications that it's going to do anything but be flat in the third quarter. Consumer, we thought would be flat as well but that business is generally kind of flattish in the third quarter. I also would expect, hopefully, that seasonality will play in the fourth quarter and that business starts to recover. But with that again, we don't have any orders or any firm indications that, that's going to happen but that's the going planning assumption at this point. And then on the auto space, which had a great quarter this quarter, in fact, it exceeded our expectations and was at a level now where it's pretty much as high or are we right in close to a tie? That business, we thought would be flat. Normally, it's seasonalities in auto is okay but it starts to fall off a little bit in our fiscal third quarter and then it starts to recover in the fourth quarter. Yes that one could surprise us again. It's kind of hard to tell. And there's certain -- we pull all these like little data points out. What the U.S. automakers are going to do in terms of shutdowns. Seems like they're not going to do as much shutdown activity, if any, through the summer. That could be positive. We think their inventory is in relatively good condition. We're designed, or rather our registrations are up in certain countries and in Europe. So there might be some opportunity there to start to see some growth. I think fundamentally though that business has a dollar content story that's been going on. It's been growing double digits for 5 years. So I would assume that even if the end unit volumes of autos is not that robust, there might be some bouncing around depending on the quarter but I think in general that business is going to grow quite well because of the dollar content. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division You mentioned your lead times in the fairly low and I would say and maybe you can go by, I mean when you're competing for business, I'm assuming everybody else's lead times are fairly or maybe outside of 1 or 2 companies [indiscernible] extending. Since like for the industry, most people have ample capacity and low lead times. You mentioned that you're not really ramping up the fabs and I think going out slow, are you built to fly, and you feel comfortable and is that why the inventory [indiscernible] . So can you just talk about -- is there any real catalyst for 1 year customers who are stocking to for lead times to extend? David A. Zinsner Yes. I think -- well I think, first of all, we have 115 days of inventory I think as of the last quarter. That's plenty of inventory, again, through any starting pickup and demand. By the time we start to deplete that level of inventory, we'll be in a place where we can build up. And a lot of stuff is sitting in finished goods are in a dye bank anyway and it can be moved through the finished goods in a relatively quick period. So I'd say right now, the way we're structured in almost any scenario of demand, at least for the foreseeable future, we should be okay in terms of being able to supply. I mean it will obviously, pull the factory up but we have enough cushion in between, plus we have inventory at distribution for that -- those customers. So that's another cushion for us to see pickup and demand. I think from a lead time perspective, when does that stretch out? We actually was just somewhat different than some company strategies. We actually try our best to keep that lead time constrain no matter what, to fix tweaks that kind of maxed maybe a few parts going into the 8-week range but for the most part, we try to keep lead times short. As much as possible, we'll build to make sure that we're meeting demand. One is hopefully capture some upside. But two, I think it's one of the things that differentiates us from our customers, that we're always there. We're always able to deliver. If you have a sudden [indiscernible] orders, we're going to have the parts there for you. And I think customers generally value it. Having said that, at some point, somebody will be short on some part. And when that happens and assuming it's a fairly meaningful part, then that customer begins to panic about every other part they buy from everyone else and they start to think about their inventory levels, which I think are relatively lean-and-go, maybe I do need to bring it back up, it will at least [indiscernible] Will what have averaged over a longer period of time. And the -- and maybe in some cases even order more than that. And then that starts to kind of permeate through the whole supply chain and then everybody starts to worry about it. And so that will happen, I'm sure. Every time somebody says we've got this all figured out and that's not going to happen, it happens. So we'll -- that's definitely not the situation I think most of us are in at this point but at some point, it's likely to happen. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division It's just maybe a refresher when you look back to last year, in the July volume falling off, you just said you had visibility into June now, what were the timing of when you saw that fall off, was it literally none for July and then by segment was there any sort of or geography any sort of we've particular weakness that may or may not repeat? David A. Zinsner Yes, well I think it was mainly in what the most noticeable thing that happened was in the industrial space. It was in the kind of U.S. and European markets for the most part, which is where most of that revenue finds its way to. Now ultimately, their end application might now go into Asia, but, who we're selling to or who we're designing with is generally in the U.S. and Europe. It's one -- the difficult thing about the business like ADI is that runs somewhat on trends and it's difficult to know whether you're in a trend until you have like 12 weeks of data and you go, \"Oh my gosh, yes, of course, we were down\". When you're sitting in the middle of it, you go, \"Oh, maybe this was an off week. And maybe they're was a vacation in Indonesia that caused this to happen. And so we have a difficulty figuring out exactly what hard details as to whether we're in the midst of something different or not. But when you look back on that period, that whole thing with sequestration and on top of the issues around Europe, I think it's just -- it turned a switch off for almost any CEO of an industrial Company to go, \"You know what, we're going to defer capital spending, I'm just very unsure about the world. And we'll come back next year and hope that the world is still alive and we'll worry about capital spending then\". And that then permeates back through, through to us and we start to see inventories start to come down and demands start to follow. And that's really what happens. And it's anybody's guess whether that happens again. At this point there's no clear indication that, that is happening. But that's why we've operate cautiously through the summer and just not take risk with our manufacturing strategy, with our operating expenses or what have you and we just carefully manage through this and when we do see a really sustained kind of level of recovery, we'll start to think about what we do in those areas. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Excellent. Maybe the auto business was trying across board for every company in Q1 and most are seeing some moderation in Q2. Obviously, a low point in Q4 so I think some of it was supply chain rebalancing included the end markets data point and it's actually fairly decent scenarios. But just curious on what you think is going around the supply chain and by being flat in Q2 is that kind of now were caught up and if the auto market continues to do well then you can drop that base or.. David A. Zinsner So we're talking calendar Q2, right? Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Sorry, yes, calendar for April. David A. Zinsner Yes, yes. So the -- yes, I think for autos, I think this period is actually -- it's hard to notice seasonality in autos right now because I thought there's been a lot of dollar content gains and also all these stuff around the cycles has really masked what is typically this quarter coming up is actually kind of a seasonally weaker quarter for autos. But I don't think there's anything systemic going on there. Did they build a little more inventory last quarter, they may have, but I'd say if they did it was relatively modest. I just think this is like a seasonal pause that you normally have and then the next quarter you start to have a new platform of course, coming out and at that point, it starts to ramp back again. I still think there is absolutely a dollar content story going on for anybody that serves the auto space. So much electronics are going in to make the systems within a car safer, to make them more energy efficient, to provide more information to the driver and what have you. And that trend, which started probably at the high-end and works its way down to the more mainstream cars is still going on. I think it's got a lot of legs to it. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division It looks like you're beaten I mean, it's [indiscernible] you're seeing a lot of impressive issues as far as reduce of pockets or pricing and autos is just the one area that actually seems -- it's going to be a good time for a while, obviously, it's attracting a lot of attention. Maybe if you could talk about where you're positioned best and what kind of growth do you see for the auto team [ph] . David A. Zinsner Well okay. So before I go into that subcategories, the one thing I would say is just suddenly waking up tomorrow and saying, \"I'm getting into the auto business\" is pretty hard to do. There are certifications that are required obviously, to supply to the automakers and they take those very seriously, the bait in auto I think is 0 to 1 parts per million that you can have in terms of failure. So your test platforms have to be pretty robust to make sure that you can deliver the quality levels that they expect and they generally, if you slip off that generally don't go back to you again. So it's a high-risk gain. So I think, although some companies might have aspirations to be in that, might be just trying to design parts into it to actually be there in volume is a whole another order and I think they're highly unlikely that somebody's going to actually enter that as they have entered already. We service 3 different subcategories within automotive: One is in Infotainment, which I talked about. This is delivering audio and video and what have you. I'd say it's the one that gets probably the most attention from everyone, because it's a kin to consumer. Parts in [indiscernible], people understand it and can see it. That's been a good business for us. It continues to be a good business. But I actually think the other 2 areas are probably have -- they probably have even more potential. One is safety systems. Safety systems at the beginning were more just figuring out ways to fire airbags but increasingly these systems are moving towards active safety systems, which actually do something to the car to make it safer in the event something's happens, antiskid, stability, control, identifying objects in the road and it's doing something with breaks so what have you moving the car in some way to make sure you're not going to hit it. Those systems are starting to permeate into the high-end of the automotive fuel space but eventually, these things are just going to be mandated across-the-board and your carmakers will need to meet safety standards and when that happens, this will be significantly pervasive through most of the automobile market. And then lastly, we serviced the powertrain market, that also gone through a transition. Powertrain was not that interesting for a while but now in an effort to make these automobiles more energy-efficient, suddenly it's got a resurgence. So this includes hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles, some of the many things that you need not to worry about in terms of the battery and something was going on. It also includes start stop battery, which I think [indiscernible] been in Europe, they know of, it's not tremendously pervasive in the U.S. market but will be. I mean this allows radio your standard combustible engines to be more energy-efficient by an order of magnitude and my guess is that, this will be mandated by most countries over the course of the next few years. And to do that kind of start stop technology, it requires a good amount of signal processing to make that happen. So we are very well-positioned. We get a lot of parts in there and I mean one of the parts we do in the safety side is a MEMs-based technology, which quite honestly not a lot of semiconductor companies can do, most of that competing technology is actually in module manufacturers like a Bosch or somebody. So we're one of the few semiconductor companies that supplies to the auto space with MEMS technology because it's just really hard to do and then meet the quality standard that the automakers really want. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division [indiscernible] into Networking, you mentioned that you give a little tease that had perked up a little bit, I think everybody's been hopeful and we've had many companies [indiscernible] that market, I think there's a big sense that it's really taking up the time but maybe he's on the look where you're seeing any particular strength and is there any -- I think there's a lot of but maybe you can talk about that in broader. David A. Zinsner So we're relatively agnostic to which carriers are going to deploy, which regions are going to deploy. Clearly, as things move from 2G to 2.5G to 3G to LTE, we -- there's been a pickup in dollar content that we've been able to garner in each kind of evolution. And so as things move from 3G, which is predominantly what we sell today, to 4G or LTE that's going to be very helpful to that business there on top of just an additional rash of deployment to improve the bandwidth. I think right now the best I can say is that the OEMs believe that it's going to happen at some point obviously. We think that just in talking into the OEMs and our own understanding network is, the other networks do need to move to higher bandwidth, higher speed systems to be able to support video and the massive amount of data rates that are going to be required to support LTE phones or 4G phones. So that in of itself is absolutely going to happen. The question has always been, when does it happen. What [indiscernible] It's been one of this that the carriers have kind of pushed off as much as they can but I think they're at the point now where they really do have to strategy kind of deploying these things. It looks like they're ramping capital spending today is more about the footprint and once that's kind of done, real estate that transitions towards the -- towards speed and bandwidth. So I think we're in the phase of footprint and we transition to bandwidth. The question is when do that happen and I don't know. And the guys that tell you they know, they have a better crystal ball than the ones that we have at ADI because the OEMs at this point although in some weeks, the orders have picked up. I don't think it's been at a sustainable level to indicate that there's significant deployment imminently going to happen and so we'll just have kind of have to wait and see. At this point now we've read the same press releases from our market analysis that everyone else reads and our hopeful and we'll just kind of wait and see. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division [indiscernible] like consumer and I give you a hard time in areas called about being selective I think for my thing obviously, there's been a lot of analog companies who have essentially the insights consumer mobile given the it doesn't fit the exact profile the rest of your business. But I guess I understand that I guess, where do you see opportunities still in consumer to really get paid for what you deliver? David A. Zinsner Well we have, in some ways, deemphasized consumer but we also I think just more sharpen our focus on the areas that we think we can participate in. We're ADI does really well is when there is some new need from the OEMs that is particularly difficult to solve technologically. And where we have the resources and some ability to solve those problems. And where we don't do well is when 17 different suppliers can do the exact same thing and just change the part number and there you go. And because we are not going to be the absolute lowest cost 20% gross margin kind of play. So we've been, what we tried to do is be careful, invest where we think we can, put the investment in, there is a benefit to being in consumer in that things that happen in the consumer space in some cases kind of move over to automotive and military and industrial. So I think we do get some cross-pollination of understanding of the technology that actually helps drive the growth rate in the other segments as well. I say that's the area that we are most focused on is the portable space. Having said that, we're not trying to be in the handset that sells 45 million units with like 7 different chips. I think what we try to do is find that 1 application, that 1 solution that maybe it goes broadly into a smartphone or maybe it goes into certain higher-end type portable application, but does something really unique and interesting that really makes a difference for their and they value and give us return. What I think Den[ph] Said in the call is no matter how well we do sometimes, the transitions happen fast and we're in and we're out. I think we always go in recognizing that, that's going to be the case. And we only put the resources in to make the ROI work for us and that's been the model. So I think we've run rate now about 15% of revenue in consumer. I'd say that's probably about what will run give or take plus or minus couple of points, which on relative basis to many of our competitors. That's actually quite low. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Dave, I wanted to ask you and as you roll the entire business I think in the last -- you just on earnings call and it's a hard question answer but if you look at your overall business, it has been down year-over-year for several quarters then there's a lot of moving pieces within that, I'm assuming that you still feel like you've been maintaining share, you've been share in some of your core markets. I don't think you're going to say the sunny market that this market has been growing. So maybe if you can walk through some of the moving pieces. David A. Zinsner Well I think in general, the semiconductor market has had good years and not so good years and we just came off a year, which the semiconductor order was not good. We're in a period of time that stretches since 2009 that like from a macroeconomic standpoint we haven't seen since 1930s. So it's if -- I think it's reasonable to expect we're going to have some volatility as people figure out the what the real level of GDP is and how much inventory they should hold and how much they can trust the suppliers to meet the demand when the demand shows up and I think we're kind of working through that process. And so 2010 was a big year, 2011 was a big year, 2012 not so good. It start now a little slow for 2013. But I think systemically, this business does grow. Once it grows, it probably grows faster than GDP, though I think it's on average over years and years and years that it grows 15%, now, probably doesn't anymore. [indiscernible] we are mid to high-single digits I think that is probably a reasonable expectation for the market. So we're in one of those periods where it depends on what upcycles, where as soon as one of these cycle starts, everybody is convinced that it's now negative. I don't think that's where we're at, and I think that, that's just a cycle and if things happen it will go the other direction and then everybody will think we're back to growing 20% a year. So -- but on average I'd say it's probably like mid-to high single-digits. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division And then one thing that you, I mean, maybe if you drove me maybe when you agree that the growth profile has matured, but I think you have seen you would agree, companies act like more mature industries as far as returning cash, you guys have raised your targets there, maybe you could talk about that and then you're committed to buying back more stock, what would be the real trigger there. I think you said be opportunistic and how you think about. David A. Zinsner Okay and so we talked about moving the -- what we have been averaging over the last few years is about 60% of our free cash flow, going back to investors but the predominant amount of that was dividends, I think going forward, we still are committed to the dividend and we still want to try to drive that dividend up over time. Having said that, to kind of move it from 60% to 80%, probably more of incrementals is going to come from buybacks. So we kind of built a model over 5 years that we thought was reasonable for us, given almost in the economic scenario that we could kind of maintain, a kind of 80% level, although having said that, which is why I talked about in the call, was some quarters is going to be less than that some quarters will be more than that and that will mainly be around buyback. The way we kind of run our buyback program is we tried to be, as you point out opportunistic or disciplined around the buybacks of the stock but that doesn't necessarily mean I have some crystal ball as to when the stock is low or when it's not, I [indiscernible] that I don't. So basically we take a pretty orderly look at this and kind of look at kind of a -- not really a long term but kind of a near-term average on a stock price. And as if that stock happens to be below that or kind of on top of that, the buybacks will kind of start to trigger if it's kind of -- for the stock has that's gone progressively running up, it won't execute during those periods of time. So we won't get below from the low per se but I think we'll get on average of price that is lower than what we're averaging. And that hopefully, buyback a little bit more stock than ordinarily. What happened under one that's more systematic that happens every quarter. But I feel fairly confident that although it may not happen in every quarter, it may not happen consistently, it will definitely average this 80%, once we look back at it over a 5-year period or even like a couple-of-year period, we'll see it average around 80%. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Either half of it, accurately, [indiscernible] more mature industry is optimizing the balance sheet and coming in the '08, '09, I think. David A. Zinsner It's like a 4 letter word. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Yes, I think it's not coming from a full circle, where people are cheering for you to add more that. You just got a deal, why not add more when you look at other industries, industrials or into staples where they care more. David A. Zinsner Right. While we're -- I'd say partly, we're easing into it a little bit. We've done, this is now our third bond deal that we've done. we just completed yesterday we got great pricing. Really, we actually locked in the treasury rate a month ago. So our real cost of this financing was somewhere in the 2.7% range for 10 years, which is unheard of. So it was a $500 million deal, we were going to redeem our bonds from -- that was going to mature in 2014 but we did add another $100 million of cash and incremental debt to the balance sheet. Yes, I think part of the strategy of getting this 80% kind of level of free cash flow return is about, incrementally adding debt. The one thing I would tell you is that -- I'm not sure, not everyone is interested in the goings-on of the rating agencies but the rating agencies tends to look at us and tend to ignore the cash balance that we have or the net cash position we have, and they kind of take this look of just the basically the cash flow and they really have us manage the debt based on how we do on this cash flow basis and so at some point as you raised that even though on a net basis is not really increasing the debt, that starts to affect your rating and then subsequently starts to affect your cost of capital. And so over time, I think we'll start to see our cash flows go up and so that will allow us to do -- -- to provide more leverage and rating agencies may relax their posture on this a little bit more over time as well, as they get comfortable with the business model. And I think ultimately, we will be a company that has leverage like the S&amp;P 500 in general has leverage to support that working capital and what have you. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division I did want to give you audience opportunity, if there's any question, so we do that now. So keep going. Here's one. Unknown Analyst Just a follow up on your balance sheet, do you have a targeted bond rating or leveraged target? David A. Zinsner Yes, so we are rating as A-, so we've targeted to maintain that A rating, A- rating. Never say never that we could take it down to BBB but we've generally committed to the bondholders that we would kind of maintain this A- rating and so we're going to do that. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division I wanted to ask about gross margins that we kind of hit in the [indiscernible] rate and doesn't seem like you're ramping up the fabs, you're hearing this amount of interim balance sheet, are there any kind of other drivers for that gross margin in the back half. And last year, you had a big consumer, driver and you expect seasonal or maybe the mix is different in [indiscernible] , what are the different factors? David A. Zinsner Well the biggest single factor for gross margins is got to be this utilization but a lot of we're deal -- the way we maintain utilization or why we maintain utilization is actually to bring inventory down. So utilization didn't start to creep up, even in kind of a not so robust improvement on the revenue side. So I think there is gross margin leverage to be had even at these kinds of level or maybe even just slightly above that. Mix, I don't think is going to be a big factor. I mean, it might be a modest factor but our gross margin's on a consumer business are actually quite good, they're not like your -- they're not your grandfather's gross margins. So I think the mix will kind of hang in there regardless of which end markets kind of moves around for the most part. We actually are consistently looking at ways to improve our cost structure for manufacturing our parts and I meet with 15 twice a quarter really to come up with something that we could do to further enhance our gross margin. So those things are progressing and I think we're making improvements there as well. So even under scenario with flattish utilization and the flattish mix, I'd still think we actually have some improvement to be had kind of modestly over the course of the next couple of years on the cost of manufacturing side.

"title": "Analog Devices Unveils New RF and Microwave Innovations at IMS2013 - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "    -New microwave power detector, integrated RF mixer and VGA offer high levels of integration and set new performance benchmarks.   NORWOOD, Mass.----  Analog Devices, Inc.   today introduced three RF and microwave ICs designed for high-performance transmitters and receivers used in high-dynamic-range applications, such as wireless infrastructure, defense systems, industrial, microwave point-to-point radios and more. The new products offer breakthrough performance and expand ADIs portfolio of more than 1,000 high-performance RF ICs covering the entire signal chain, from antenna to bits and back. Featured in Booth #2411 at the International Microwave Symposium in Seattle, Wash., June 2-7, the new devices include:   Incorporating ADIs leading high-performance broadband power detection technology, the ADL6010 microwave power detector offers unprecedented linearity and stability over temperature. Unlike alternative devices based on commonly used non-linear and non-temperature-stable Schottky diodes, the ADL6010 features a simple, proprietary linearization system that eliminates distortion due to source loadingan important benefit in applications where a low-ratio coupler is used to extract a sample of the primary signal. The ADL6010s linearization system achieves leading accuracy and improves the temperature performance to 0.5 dB over the range of -40C to +85C. The ADL6010 microwave detector is accurate from 500 MHz to 40 GHz, has a 50-ohm input impedance and an input range of -30 dBm to 15 dBm.   Designed for high performance digital pre-distortion  receivers, the ADRF6620 provides a full-featured solution in a compact form factor. The device integrates a 700 MHz to 2.7 GHz wideband synthesizer, an active mixer, a high-dynamic-range digital VGA, RF DSA, 4:1 RF input switch, RF balun and LDO. The ADRF6620 offers significant bill of material savings while maintaining low noise and high linearity performance. The 4:1 RF input switch makes the ADRF6620 ideal for DPD receivers in MIMO infrastructure applications. With an OIP3 of up to 44 dBm from RF input to DGA output, the ADRF6620 is well suited for high-performance UMTS, LTE-A and MC-GSM DPD applications.   Designed for new high-bandwidth microwave point-to-point receivers, the ADRF6518 is a high-dynamic-range, low-noise, dual-channel baseband VGA with dual 63 MHz programmable low-pass filters and dual power detectors. The device offers significant bill of materials savings by replacing discrete filters and amplifiers and replacing them with a highly integrated programmable bandwidth and gain device. The ADRF6518 features excellent channel-to-channel match and flexible gain control and can be used in receivers supporting up to 112-MHz channel bandwidth, as well as new E-Band receivers with up to 1-GHz of channel bandwidth. The new VGA is capable of rejecting large out-of-band interferers while amplifying the desired signal, reducing the bandwidth and dynamic range requirements of the ADC.

"content": "  Do not worry if you have missed out on prior picks in the tech sector because I have another one for you. Like Microsoft Corp.  and International Business Machines Corp. , I expect this pick to outperform the S&amp;P 500 substantially. Since we picked it on Sept. 28, MSFT rose 10% while the S&amp;P 500 rose 7%. Since we picked it on August 17, IBM rose 14% while the S&amp;P 500 rose 12%. As detailed in our ETF report on the tech sector, tech stocks are far and away the most profitable. That sectors returns on invested capital  stand at 42.3%, which is more than double the S&amp;P500 at 17.4%. And this weeks stock pick of the week is no exception. Analog Devices Inc. , one of Decembers Most Attractive Stocks, boasts a 54% ROIC. And like all of our Most Attractive Stocks the company has:high and rising economic profits  and a cheap valuation. As shown in our free report on ADI, the companys ROIC  is in the top quintile of all the companies we cover and its economic earnings are growing faster then reported accounting earnings. During its last fiscal year, ADIs economic earnings rose by 283% while accounting earnings rose by only 187%. Digging through the financial footnotes, we found $15mm in non-operating/non-recurring charges that cause reported earnings to be understated.   At the same time, the stocks valuation implies that ADIs profits will decline by 10% and never grow again. In other words, the stock market is predicting a permanent decline of more than 10% in ADIs profits. Given that most investors are not aware that the companys operating profits are as strong as they are, the market is probably not giving ADI appropriate credit for its profitability. In summary, the market is setting the profit growth bar quite low for this stock.  HIDDEN GEMS: About $15 million in non-operating expenses  cause reported earnings to be understated. Our discounted cash flow analysis shows that ADIs current valuation  implies that the companys profits will decline by 10% and never grow again. The company grew its economic earnings by $283mm during its last fiscal year. Excess cash of $2,462.5mm or nearly 25% of its market cap In summary, ADI gets our very attractive stock rating because its economic earnings are strong and growing while its valuation implies economic earnings will decline permanently by 10%. ADI fits the risk/reward profile of a great stock to buy. Note: Stock pick of the week is updated every Tuesday.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices: A Solid, Long-Term Investment - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices, Inc.  engages in the design, manufacture, and marketing of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in industrial, communication, computer, and consumer applications. The companys products convert real-world phenomena, such as light, sound, temperature, motion, and pressure into electrical signals. Its products are used in a range of electronic equipment. The company sells its products worldwide through direct sales force, third-party distributors, and independent sales representatives, as well as through its Web site. Analog Devices, Inc. was founded in 1965 and is headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts. How Well Is the Company Growing? With every business we want to know if they are growing. Why would we put money into a business that is not growing? Over the last year, ADI has been just barely above industry average. Whereas the Industry as a whole has a sales growth rate of 38.4%, ADI came in at 40.8% so they are healthy and performing as expected. On a quarter to quarter basis looking at Net Income I guess one cannot complain at their performance even though they came in half of what the industry had in growth from first quarter comparisons. Since we were coming off a poor 2009, The Semiconductor- Broad Line industry had tremendous growth of 563.9% while ADI came in at 223%; only half the industry. Evidently, ADI has had more expenses than the industry average. It has cost more to make money than it has the other members of the industry. How Valuable Is the Stock?Click charts below to enlarge How does one know how valuable a stock is? Cash is King! If this is the case, we are going to see that ADI may not be the valued stock to purchase right now in this industry. When we think about value we have to think about the potential growth. How much potential? Something called the price to sales ratio gives us the best indicator of this. The more money a company has coming in through sales compared to how much working capital it has speaks volumes about its health. The lower the price/sales ratio, the healthier it is. ADI has a ratio of 3.91% and that is a whopping 29% higher than the Industry, which records a ratio of 2.90 Do they have what it takes to grow right now? The second most important thing we need to consider is how much money is flowing through this company as compared to its price. This is called the price to cash flow ratio. ADI again comes in much higher, showing that it has 50% less money flowing through the company compared to its price right now. Its price to cash flow ratio is 15.6% while the industry comes in at 10.10%. In the Industry as a whole, it does not appear that ADI would be the first choice of value to invest in presently.  Future Growth ADI has one huge advantage over its competitors in the analogue market worldwide. ADI has a market share of twice that of its nearest competitor. 2010 data converter revenue will likely increase by more than 20 percent from the previous year, and longer term estimates show that the market for converters should continue to experience an average annual growth rate of nine percent through 2015.; this bodes well for ADI. Since 2009 ADI has had nothing but upgrades from Analysts; this bodes well looking into long term growth for the company.  Technical Outlook On this weekly chart ADI looks very healthy for a long term investment. We are forming an Ascending Triangle which is a bullish formation that usually forms during an uptrend as a continuation pattern.   These patterns mostly tend to lean toward a bullish sentiment and acknowledge accumulation. As this pattern forms, we see a slight contraction in volume, and that is evident here. Indicators are all healthy in the bullish areas where they should be.  From a technical standpoint, ADI looks ready to break out into a long term growth pattern. It needs to break through that 31.90 resistance barrier that has plagued it throughout the year. This is what we would wait for before we look into a long term investment in the stock.  Summary From a growth perspective, ADI leads its industry and may be the reason that it does not grow as fast as others it competes with. This being said, short term, there may be better stocks to look at in the industry if one is looking for short term investments. But, if someone is looking for a long term investment, ADI is worth putting on ones watch list for a possible near term long play. Investing in the stock or a long term option play may be a great value here.Disclosure: Author long ADI Source: Analog Devices: A Solid, Long-Term Investment  SA.Pages.Article.handleDisclosures;      This article was sent to 1,088 people who get email alerts on .

"content": "  Analog Devices, Inc.  is scheduled to announce its fiscal first-quarter 2012 results on February 22, 2012. We witness limited movements in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release. Prior-Quarter Synopsis Analogs fourth quarter 2011 pro forma earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, or 4.8% due to weaker-than-expected revenue and margins, which in turn impacted earnings. Revenue in the quarter was $716.1 million, down 5.5% sequentially and 7.0% year over year, particularly due to the weakness in the communications and industrial end markets. However, the consumer segment performed well in the quarter on account of seasonal increase in demand for digital cameras, gaming systems and the like. Automotive was also up 11.2% sequentially. Gross margin of 64.3% was down both sequentially and year over year, impacted by an unfavorable mix and lower utilization rates, as Analog cut production to lower both internal and distributor inventories. First Quarter Guidance Analog expects first quarter revenue to decline 510% sequentially with the gross margin being 63% , operating expenses of $226229 million and diluted EPS of 4451 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 59 cents when the company reported earnings, well over the guided range.Agreement of Analysts Out of the 19 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, one made an upward revision in the last 30 days, while for fiscal 2012, one analyst made a downward revision over the same time period. The majority of analysts expect a decent first quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS  in line with the Street consensus estimates of $662 million and $0.48, respectively. Additionally, they anticipate gross margins in line with management guidance of 63.0% . The analysts expect to see strength in the automotive end market and stabilization in industrial and communications, which have remained weak thus far, driven by 3G deployments in China. They also contend that increasing semiconductor content in automobiles will drive the companys revenue growth. They also believe that order trends in the analog segment are improving and channel inventory is at a record low level. Hence, they expect to see strong recovery in the second half of 2012 driven by improved demand and inventory restocking. However, a handful of analysts do not expect a strong quarter due to a certain amount of softness in the industrial and communications business and uncertainty in the current environment. Magnitude of Estimate Revisions In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2012. Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 11 cents to 48 cents for the first quarter and 37 cents to $2.28 for fiscal 2012. The significant decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the 90-day period was in response to managements comments during the fourth quarter earnings call, following which a majority of analysts had lowered estimates. Our Recommendation Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. We remain encouraged by the companys dominant position in many of its product segments, and meaningfully improved gross and operating margin structures. However, we remain concerned about the tough macroeconomic environment and softness within the communications and industrial infrastructure markets. With customers continuing to cut inventories and typical first quarter seasonality, we do not expect Analog Devices to see a strong first quarter. Also, given that the company expects lower sales during Christmas and the lunar New Year, it will effectively have 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue in the upcoming quarter. Analog, which competes with other large analog players, such as Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology Corp , Maxim Integrated Products  and Texas Instruments , holds a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term Sell rating.

"content": "   Executives David A. Zinsner - Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance   Analog Devices Inc.  Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference February 26, 2013 4:20 PM ETUnknown Analyst All right. Just a quick note on disclosure. First, our disclosure. Please note that all important disclosures, including personal holdings disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures appear on the Morgan Stanley website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. So with that out of the way, I'm very pleased to announce from Analog Devices, CFO, Dave Zinsner; and Head of IR, Ali Husain. Thanks, guys, for coming. David A. Zinsner Sure, thanks.   Question-and-Answer Session Unknown Analyst So it seems like you guys just reported, it was a January quarter, it seems like you've seen the same patterns in other analog companies. Bookings were weak in the October, November time frame and have since gotten better. Can you talk about how you see that? Where do you think we are in the potential for a semiconductor pickup based on inventories? David A. Zinsner Yes. So as you mentioned, we had I'd say weaker orders in November, when we looked back on it. December was clearly weaker particularly because of the shutdowns that occurred at the end of December. And then for the first week of January, again, it was -- it started off kind of weak. But then as the month wore on in January, I'd say things just continually improved. Orders continually got stronger. We kind of went through the lunar new year with a little bit of weakness in Asia, but that picked -- bounced right back and things have been very strong. Our guidance is somewhat reflective of the fact that we do think that, at least as we see it, the kind of cyclical downturn that occurred looks like we kind of hit bottom and have recovered off the bottom. And now it's just a question of whether that's sustainable or not. Unknown Analyst Yes. I guess the thing that's puzzled me, and I've gotten this a little bit wrong as we've gotten through the last few quarters, but I felt like this time last year, when there was a pickup, you had just seen a strong inventory reduction from a bunch of your customers. It was very clear that you had the potential for kind of a catch-up base, as you caught up to consumption. I felt like we actually had that, but demand was weak and so that didn't look as exciting as we thought it would earlier in the year. And then now, if I look back at the last couple of quarters, I mean, I felt we entered that period with customer inventories being very lean after several quarters of reduction. So did they get even leaner? Or was it actual demand that fell off? Or just how do you see -- how did that industrial trend get so soft and kind of come back so quickly? David A. Zinsner Well, I think it was a combination of, I think, demand got a little weaker, and I think they did try to lean out inventories a little bit further. If you look at kind of the way last year kind of progressed, we kind of had a kind of a correction in the first quarter. It seemed to recover in the second quarter. But I think as we -- as you got into the back half of the year, confidence levels of our customers, which is kind of collectively all the major manufacturers worldwide, I think it got worse. People were worried about what was going on in the U.S. around the fiscal policy. People were worried about Europe because of the issues around southern countries within Europe. There was kind of political change over in China, and a lot of things kind of got halted because of that. So there was just uncertainty across the board in almost every geography. And as a result, most of our customers just kind of cranked their inventories down and slowed down programs and slowed down projects. And if there were build-outs that were going to occur via capital spend, those things got pushed out. And when all those things happened, that ends up being kind of a bit more impactful when you're way at the far end of the supply chain. And so as a result, we saw our business kind of fall off. We had some things that kind of went in our favor in the back half of the year, that kind of kept things a little bit going. But when we kind of struck into the first quarter, it certainly rolled off. And then I think that's the question now for this year is we're back to this kind of situation. We had a first quarter correction, things are recovering. We think we'll have a good second quarter. And it's -- the big question is will we now get the kind of confidence that I think is necessary to really have a decent improvement in the business? Unknown Analyst And as to the first statement that you think you're shipping to end demand right now, I know it's hard to be certain. David A. Zinsner I think it's difficult to determine at the moment. I clearly think that we weren't in the first [indiscernible]. And in the industrial side, we weren't in the fourth quarter. It does feel like if industrial is up kind of meaningfully this quarter, really the principal driver of the recovery for us sequentially, you would think that we're starting to get back to a level that's closer to equilibrium. There could be customers that are working inventories down further. But I think in general, most people are kind of now at a level of, okay, we're going to kind of keep the status quo, see how things are going. And if the business recovers, end demand starts to recover, we'll start to bring back inventory levels and demand. Unknown Analyst Okay. And then how do you think about your own inventory levels with regards to that? And the distribution channel where you took down dollars in inventory distribution, the days went up a little. And it seems like if I'm an end customer, there's enough inventory in front of me that I can kind of wait for demand, which is -- could be good news because if the demand comes through, then you'll see a strong third month to the quarter which [indiscernible] David A. Zinsner Yes, and I think that's kind of reflective -- our lead times are 4 weeks. It's certainly reflected in there. Our inventory is kind of north of 120 days. That was actually -- I think we're at similar levels last year at that time, too. The difference for us this time around is we cranked utilization up more significantly last year and built inventory with the expectation that we were coming off of what we thought was the bottom and we're going to have a pretty strong recovery. This time around, I think we'll be a little bit more conservative about it. We're going to tick up utilization but it's going to be very small, probably from kind of mid-50s to the high 50s. That's going to have the effect of bringing inventories on our balance sheet in absolute dollar terms down. And of course, given that business can be up, it's going to be a meaningful drop in the days of inventory. So that's a little bit of a different tact than we took last time. Inventories distribution is, if you look at it kind of on a look-back basis in terms of weeks of inventory, it's up to 8 weeks of inventory. But in absolute dollars, we haven't been this low, I think, I don't know, like several years, right? So this is a very lean environment for us from a distributor perspective. And based on the order flow that we're seeing from distributors and kind of our strategy around having enough inventory to meet demand, I'm going to expect that we're going to start to see a little bit of a creep-up in the absolute dollars of inventory this quarter. It might actually be down in terms of days in inventory. But certainly, in absolute dollars, we think it will be up in the second quarter. But as you said, I think we're in a pretty good position to meet demand regardless of what that demand looks like at 120 days of inventory or plus. But not so significant that if business does start to recover we start to see some amendment in the business. We won't be constrained in terms of our opportunities, you could start to see some real leverage in the P&amp;L. We're -- our gross margins will go up this quarter, but not significantly. If we do start to see a pretty meaningful ramp in demand, we start to crank utilization. We'll start to see some really good leverage on the gross margin side. Unknown Analyst Yes, I mean, I was quite impressed by where margins have been, actually, given where utilizations are. So you mentioned -- a couple of minutes ago, you mentioned that the bookings pattern was good, there's a little bit of weakness around the lunar new year. But in general, I mean, the bottom line is kind of month-by-month things keep picking up consistently with that view that this -- it feels like a bottoming process [indiscernible]. David A. Zinsner Correct. Unknown Analyst Perfect. And then your Industrial business at 45% of revenues was down about 12% last year. And that's certainly a lot more than I thought it would be down. And I had a pretty conservative macro view on what the year would look like, but I felt like your medical devices group would sort of insulate that and energy and some of the other -- there's -- everything is a little bit cyclical, but I felt like different cycles are hit at different times, and it seemed like it all kind of uniformly came down, and do you think can it all uniformly go back up? David A. Zinsner I think you probably can expect that actually. And usually, it does. I'm kind of with you, I actually didn't think it would drop to the level that it ended up dropping. But I do think it was clearly kind of inventory management at our customers and some pushouts in terms of capital spend. This business is 60,000 customers. It's very distributed. Most customers don't buy a significant amount of volume on an individual basis. They might buy 10,000 units. Most of the products are older, and the customers have been very loyal to not only the brand of ADI but that specific part and what it does in their given applications. So it's not like we're seeing share shifts. The ASPs are very stable in that business. In some cases, they actually go up. So there's no dynamic or no nefarious dynamic going on there. It clearly is about how inventory levels have moved around based on customers' feelings about the world. And I do think at this point now, given that it is down so significantly, our end customers are not down so significantly, that it comes back to normalized levels. And if we can start to see some capital spend go on in the world, it should have a pretty good recovery. Unknown Analyst Well it's definitely what our investors want exposure to right now, I think. And I guess one of the pushbacks I got when I -- in terms of why medical was weak, it had a lot of -- it's the same infrastructure mindset in China, in particular, that sort of had driven all those businesses. You had factories and hospitals and infrastructure just getting built and it all came to stop in one set [ph]. Is it possible to isolate out the impact of China from all this? I know your -- the business you ship in to China actually grew, but other devices that shipped in other regions into China. David A. Zinsner Yes, that's a difficulty we have because we sell to most of the larger industrial companies around the world. They end up shipping, I think, a fair amount of their product into China. It's hard for us to really track what goes into China versus what goes into other locations. But certainly, China is impactful to that business directly but also indirectly to our customers in other parts of the world. Unknown Analyst Okay, great. And then moving over to the communications business, it's about 19% of revenues. That was weak for you actually last quarter and continues to be a little bit weak. It's actually an area where I'm pretty bullish. David A. Zinsner Good. Unknown Analyst [indiscernible] last year. But I feel like there were visible signs of customer inventory reduction in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and there's visible signs that demand can actually come back. What's your feeling now? I mean, do you get the visibility from anybody at, or is that -- you sort of hoping that that's case but don't see it yet? David A. Zinsner I mean, well, one of the reasons why we didn't quite hit the midpoint of our guidance and came in at the lower end was really because of the communications business. And we did kind of feel like we were going to have a pretty good quarter for comm, it ended up being down, which was a little bit of a surprise to us. And what our best read on it is, one, capital spending wasn't really robust last quarter for comm. And two, it did look like some of our customers did take the opportunity to clean up their balance sheet for the end of December, and that had kind of a secondary effect on that business. As we kind of -- and we have to be cautious about how we read these things because I think our customers generally are almost as confused as we are sometimes about when the capital spend is going to come and when we're going to start to see a pickup in the business. But the read that we get from our customers, which are the base station manufacturers and the comm -- the wireline comm guys, is that things will start to recover in the back half of our fiscal year, which is our kind of third and fourth fiscal quarter. And it's likely to be up a little bit this coming quarter, but we really won't see that, the lift, until the back half of the year. And there's a lot of kind of anecdotal discussions that some of the carriers in the U.S. are talking about in terms of their capital spending, what we're hearing from China in terms of their approach to the next build-out of their infrastructure. And all that stuff is supposed to kind of intersect in the back half of the year. So we'll have to see how it goes. We certainly are going to be cautious about what we do both in terms of managing our inventory levels and our OpEx and not assume that's going to come. But we're cautiously optimistic that that's what's going to happen in the back half of the year. Unknown Analyst I mean, is it a fair assessment that that's how all of us have sort of felt for the last 12 months? Is it always 1 quarter or 2 away or... David A. Zinsner Yes, I would say, and I think everybody can... Unknown Analyst [indiscernible] David A. Zinsner Yes, yes. But I would say that the networks are absolutely creaking right now. And the carriers have done a lot to kind of milk the network as much as they can to make the network work. That hasn't always been successful. There's been a couple of times where that hasn't worked out in certain carriers' cases. And in general, the data speeds are pretty bad. So we do expect that over time, they're going to have to spend money to improve the network so that we can all kind of work on our iPhones and what have you. The other thing that I think will happen that's starting in kind of the early stages at this point, but I think will ramp over time, is this kind of move towards kind of smaller form factors with less power like small cells and those kind of things. And for ADI, we're a little bit more focused in our successes is more dictated on how many radios get sold versus how many systems get installed. So as things kind of migrate to some architecture that includes small cell, that should have the effect of significantly increasing the radio count of what gets sold per year. For us, we're almost agnostic to whether it's kind of small cell or large cell based on dollar content. So if the unit volume growth is significant, that could be very significant for us in terms of a tailwind to the business. Unknown Analyst Okay, that's great. I think that's an area of concern for a lot of people in other comm-centric mediums that have faced these exposures. Within autos, so autos is almost reverse of everything else because it's been great for the last couple of years and a little bit weak the last quarter or 2. What's your perception of that weakness? Is that just the disruption that we saw in the supply chain last quarter and is it going to be short term? David A. Zinsner Yes, I think a little bit. I mean, we had some kind of mix going on where some programs were rolling off, others were delayed in terms of when they rolled on. And I think that also was a little bit of a headwind to the automotive business. This quarter, we're suspecting it to have a pretty nice sequential improvement. I think the underlying kind of macro drivers to auto that we're really making a go for -- I think in 2007, our business was $225 million or so. And I don't know this year what we'll do but let's say it's in the $450 million to $500 million range. This business has grown significantly over the last few years. And the drivers are, I think, everyone knows about it, but dollar content, electrification of the car has been pretty significant, a lot of technology going into safety systems, both passive and active safety systems, a lot of semiconductors going into infotainment. And now as the car becomes maybe more fuel-efficient, more power-efficient be it on a hybrid or electric vehicle or has some other spec technology like start-stop kind of technology, that requires a lot of semiconductor and a lot of analog content to make those products or those applications work properly. And we just kind of continue to see an opportunity to have increasing dollar content in the vehicles in the next several years. And regardless of whether the unit volumes are up or down, I think that, that is going to fundamentally trump the unit volume and should really provide a lot of tailwinds to that business. Unknown Analyst I feel like, as you mentioned, the investors are starting to look for that theme growing dollar content. So it's actually kind of interesting if you look at the various semiconductor vendors with auto exposure. It's actually pretty clear that you and Linear Tech are doing something different than other people because your growth rate has been a lot higher, both companies. Is that just a function, you think, of focusing design count on that market a little bit more than you did 5, 10 years ago? Or is there some function in being in the right place? David A. Zinsner What we've been doing over time is trying to create a more balanced approach towards the business where we have this kind of long tail horizontal market merely sold through distribution. And we kind of continued to focus resources at that marketplace. But we have shifted some of our resources towards being more application-focused to focus on application-specific products as well. And one of the earlier initiatives into the application-specific area was in the auto space. And that kind of predates even when I started, so I don't recall, 2007 I think, they really started to have an active focus, really understand the ecosystem on the automotive space, the whole system, what areas we thought we could be successful in, what technologies that the automakers or the module makers may not even appreciate may be necessary to drive the next generation of applications within automotive. And we focused in that area and we put development efforts in that area and we talked to the customers. And over time, I think we built up a really solid business. Now I don't know what every other competitor out there has done in that space, they may or may not have done that, but that's been our approach and it's turned out to be, I think, fairly successful. Unknown Analyst That's great. And your assessment of the inventories that are carried at the automotive guys is that they are pretty lean and then... David A. Zinsner Yes, I mean, well, they generally carry their inventories pretty lean. A lot of them operate in kind of what they call VMI or vendor management inventory approach, so they literally just pull when they need product. And so they are not really in a position whether they build a lot of inventory of our parts. So we see a lot less -- it's a lot less cynical in terms of inventory cycles, and it's more a function of just more programmatically, when thing -- when programs roll off or roll on, that has a bigger driver towards whether it will be successful or not. Unknown Analyst Okay, great. Well, I'll just -- I'll finish my trip through the revenue stream and then we'll open up to the audience. But with consumer, you had alluded to some product cycles in the back half of the year. We did see those, but the business is still down year-on-year. Can you talk about what the issues are there, and if you'll see those product cycles recur kind of in the back half of this year? David A. Zinsner So the consumer space is one of these areas where we to -- we, as a company, have to be selective given the DNA of -- our devices have to be more on the kind of technology forefront. We tend not to be the lowest cost producer and we tend to lead with technology. And then on the consumer space, given that the cycles are fast and costs can sometimes be the more dominant driver or determiner which vendor a customer chooses, we tend to be in sometimes and out sometimes. And I think in some cases in the last few years, we've been out more than we've been in. We put someone new into that business, I don't know, maybe about 1.5 years or 2 years ago. He's been kind of doing the same approach we really -- we did in the auto space years before, but really focusing on what technologies we have, where we can differentiate, where we have, what we think are proprietary capabilities in that space and really focusing our resources on that. And there is a little bit of a time lag in terms of taking all that effort and really creating a business and then really seeing kind of the fruits of that. And in the meantime, there's a little bit of dribbling out of the old stuff that we got years ago that we haven't reinvested in. So I think that's really what's going on. We'll continue to be selective. But I have a feeling over time we're going to start to see more momentum in that business than we've seen in the past. It may not be this year, but I certainly think over the next few years, we'll find opportunities to be successful in that space with -- in areas where technology will really matter. And we are already starting to see that. And I think that's one of the things that helped out in the back half of 2012. I expect that we'll probably see something similar to that in 2013, and then we'll just kind of see how it goes. Unknown Analyst Okay. Great. Let me see if there's any questions from the audience. If not, I'll keep going. Unknown Analyst Most semiconductor companies are reporting very low levels of channel inventory. So I'm interested in your thoughts as to whether you think that's a new normal, so structurally lower or whether it's just a reflection of where we are in the cycle? David A. Zinsner Yes. I kind of feel like the inventory levels at distribution are highly dependent on kind of in-demand and lead times. And as soon as lead times stretch out a little bit and end demand gets robust, they suddenly throw out the old model and bring in a new model, which is carry higher levels of inventory to make sure they aren't caught short. And I suspect that will happen when that happens. It just so happens that over the last 18 months or so, there hasn't been a big stimulus to the end demand side of things and lead times have been relatively short, so they haven't had to panic that much about where they're going to get their products. But mark my word, as soon as there is one little slip and one little part stretches out in terms of lead time, they'll suddenly have a new whole new approach to inventory levels and they'll bring them up. Unknown Analyst What would you want distribution inventory to be, if it were under your control? I mean, you have this inventory that never really declines in value. You can only lose business if you don't have the product to support it. So I mean, why not carry a high level of inventory? David A. Zinsner At distribution? Unknown Analyst At distribution and on your own balance sheet, why not? David A. Zinsner Yes, and I think that is the approach we take. I mean, we generally carry 100 -- I mean, our goal is really to carry 110 days, 100 to 110 days of inventory. I think if you look at us relative to most of the competitors, that's a little high. And we do that because we try to keep the lead times short. One of the things we think we differentiate ourselves on is we don't run into -- we try not to run into situations where we drive our lead times out 12 weeks and we let the -- we give customers confidence that we're going to be able to provide the part when and if they're going to need it. Unknown Analyst And in the distribution side, you don't recognize it as revenue anyway, [indiscernible] why not? David A. Zinsner And we take little risk on it because most of the parts are very long life cycle parts, and so it's not like we have obsolescence risk that some customers -- or competitors that are more focused in the consumer space where cycles are faster. They obviously take more risk to do that. And that is our approach. Now I think that the goal would be to have about 8 weeks of inventory at distribution by virtue of the fact that business is down, they are at 8 weeks. When business recovers next quarter, they're likely not to be 8 weeks. But I think over time, we would rather see them at 8. We'd like to be kind of in that 110 days or maybe slightly lower than that. I wouldn't want to get too low because you do run the risk of stretching out lead times. And once lead times stretch out, not only do you have serious issues with just relationships with customers which can be problematic, but you completely lose visibility as to what's going on because then you start to have double ordering and people hoarding and then that... Unknown Analyst Of course, that's what we all want. David A. Zinsner Yes, you guys want that but I don't want that. Unknown Analyst Understood. Any other questions from the audience? You had alluded to gross margins and you put up a pretty good gross margin number for the utilization that you had at 64%, with mid-50s type of utilization. Do you think that signals that you can get to new highs in gross margin? And I know you've done a lot of things, you personally and the company have done a lot of things to improve gross margin. Are there still, I know there's smaller things now, but are there still things you can do to kind of keep moving up through the cycle gross margin? David A. Zinsner Yes, I think so. I mean, clearly, we're happy that our gross margins at kind of lower utilizations has been -- we typically run -- I think, I can't remember the last time we were in the 50s, but I think it was in 2009, if I'm not correct -- if I'm not mistaken. So it's -- I think, just to know that we're now -- our low point is higher than the high points that we used to have in prior years I think is a pretty significant accomplishment. We are doing a lot of little things now to improve the gross margins further. I don't think there are big structural changes that need to happen in terms of closing fabs or what-have-you that would move our margins up significantly. But there are a lot of things that we can do that are subtle around pricing and around cost that I think can help improve the gross margin for the next cycle. But first, what I want to do is get a recovery going and start to see our -- the company improve back to the levels that we were operating in, in kind of 2011, early part of 2012. And when that happens, then we're -- then I think we'll be ready to talk about numbers that are higher than that. Unknown Analyst Yes, fair enough. And to the extent that if industrial does lead the way out and is stronger, that obviously helps gross margin? David A. Zinsner Absolutely, it's unofficial. Industrial, on a cost basis, have much better margins. But on a -- on top of that, most of that, the internal manufacturing is in industrial businesses. And so if industrial recovers, we get huge fall-through and huge absorption benefit based on the internal manufacturing model. Unknown Analyst Okay, great. And my last question is going to be on cash. You guys have a lot of it. I don't think the market is giving you full credit for it. You had the highest dividend yield and now TI is obviously taking a much bigger stance in terms of returning 100% of the cash flow to shareholders. Where do you guys stand now in terms of thinking about dividends versus buybacks versus other uses of cash? David A. Zinsner So you may have noticed that we increased our dividend last quarter by, I think, it was 13%, right? So we continue to be very committed on the dividend. I think historically we had been paying out about 40% of our earnings in dividends. We've been kind of trying to push that up. I think if you look over the next few quarters, it's probably going to be like 60%, it's what it's going to end up being of our free cash flow. It's going to be out in dividend. So we have definitely tried to be, tried to lead, I guess, with dividends to improve shareholder returns. We still have a buyback program, we're still committed to the buyback program. I would say one of -- maybe the one difference we have now than we've had perhaps in periods beforehand was that we do have kind of a -- we do look at the price of the stock relative to kind of historical averages. And when the stock falls below those historical averages, that's when we tend to take an opportunity to buy the stock versus the old model, which I think a lot of other companies employed as well, which is you ended up buying when times were good because you felt the world was better, and that ended up being the high price for buying the stock right back. We try to take it and hopefully take advantage of the volatility in the stock and buybacks on the lows. But I think you'll see over time we'll be very good purchasers of our stock. Then the rest of it, the cash, which I don't think we'll have a significant need for, but there is some M&amp;A that we do from time to time. It tends to be more tuck-in oriented. And but those -- the price tags on those can be at varying levels, so we'll hopefully take some opportunity, some of the cash in a place where we think we can get a really good ROI on it for technology that it would make more sense to buy it than build it internally. And those are the kind of 3 uses. Unknown Analyst And for the filings you have, over $3 a share of that cash that is actually in the U.S., is not -- there's no -- is not subject to repatriation? David A. Zinsner Yes, I guess so. $10 is [indiscernible]. It's high-order math. Unknown Analyst So I mean, that's not a factor of you can return... David A. Zinsner You know what, there's no -- there's almost no limitation to the cash. I mean, we have $1.1 billion of cash on U.S., we have another $500 million revolver that's untouched that if we needed to use cash we could certainly get at it. So I think there's plenty of flexibility. The U.S. has plenty of opportunities to raise more cash if they wanted to do buybacks and stuff. That certainly isn't going to be an impediment to anything we do on that capital structure side. It's just more a function of hopefully being smart about when we do make the purchases of the stock and try to buy it at low points. Unknown Analyst Great, all right.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices: Short The Decoupling - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "   Investors in Analog Devices  have enjoyed an 11% year-to-date return. This return coupled with a 2.95% dividend yield has left almost all holders of the stock delighted to have owned shares. Even though the company has done very well this year, I believe that investors should consider selling shares. Through this analysis, I will present the bearish case for Analog Devices and explain why I believe that we may see a price decline in the near future.A History of ReturnsIn order to objectively analyze ADI from a fundamental standpoint, I have relied heavily on return on assets and return on equity. Return on assets is the net income of the firm divided by average total assets. Return on assets is very important to monitor in that through return on assets, an analyst can understand how efficiently the company uses its operational property to generate profits for the firm. Return on equity is the net income of the firm divided by directly-invested shareholder equity and this key metric tells the researcher how well management uses investments to generate profits for the firm. In the chart below, 5 years of return on assets and return on equity can be seen for ADI.Over the past 5 years, it can be seen that ADI has had a volatile history of returns. Beginning in 2008, ADI experienced a fundamental gain in performance in which return on assets and return on equity increased until the fourth quarter of that year. This increase in performance was associated with an 18% gain in stock price. Immediately after this period, the firm entered a stage of decline, much like most companies of this time, and performance fell from the fourth quarter of 2008 until the fourth quarter of 2009. During this period, the share price experienced a likewise decrease of around 15%. In the fourth quarter of 2009, ADI began a period of strong performance in which it increased return on assets and return on equity until the middle of 2011. This period of increased performance was coupled with a gain of around 25% in the stock price. Since the middle of 2011, the fundamental returns of the organization have declined. During the past year and a half, the stock price has risen around 15%. The chart below shows a summary of these time periods.From the table above, a simple relationship can be extrapolated. As a firm increases its fundamental performance, it tends to experience an increase in stock price. This makes intuitive sense in that as a firm betters itself, the market tends to reward it by allocating greater quantities of capital to the security. Investors seek to park capital with firms that deliver performance and withdraw capital from firms in decline. This relationship has been true over the past 5 years - until now. Over the past year, the firm has experienced a significant pullback in performance in that returns on assets and return on equity have both declined by several percentage points. If history and intuition is to be a rough guide to the future, then ADI should experience share price declines in the near future. ADI is experiencing moderate and declining firm-level performance and I believe that share price will eventually \"wake-up\" to this fact and decline in the future. In light of the deteriorating fundamentals of this organization, as measured by return on assets and return on equity, I recommend shorting the security in the near future.Technically SpeakingEven though I believe that the odds currently favor shorting ADI, I do not believe that investors should immediately short the security. I believe that through patience, investors can best time their investment. ADI has been in a moderately-strong uptrend for the past year and I believe that investors should wait until the trend breaks down prior to initiating a short. As seen in the chart below, I believe that an appropriate participation level is $37.50. If price is able to close below $37.50 on a weekly-basis, then I believe investors should consider shorting ADI. I believe that investors should immediately seek to protect capital by placing a stop-loss at $42.00 per share. If price exceeds this level, then a new yearly-high will have been made and a short position will be inappropriate. If price is able to decline as this thesis predicts, then I believe investors should consider exiting one-half of their short position at $30.50. Not only is $30.50 where the current fundamental decoupling began, but it is also a location of significant technical support. For the remaining position, I believe that investors should consider exiting all shares at $26.50. This level has been a historic support point for the past 5 years and I believe price will stall here and reverse course in the future.The table below shows a breakdown of the trade recommendation. It can be seen that investors stand to gain $2.00 for every $1.00 they are willing to risk. Probabilistically speaking, this analysis needs a 50% chance of being correct for investors to consider shorting ADI using this suggested systematic approach. I believe that it has fundamentally been seen that price should be declining right now due to a deterioration of firm-level performance. If investors agree with this synopsis, then they should consider shorting ADI in the near future.

My name is Terry, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices' Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Husain, you may begin your conference. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Terry, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. If listeners haven't yet seen our second quarter 2013 press release or our Form 10-Q, they can be found on ADI's IR website at investor.analog.com. This conference call can also be accessed from the same page. A recording of this conference call will be available within 2 hours of this call's completion. It will remain available via telephone playback for 2 weeks, and it will also be archived on our Investor Relations website. We've also updated the financial schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;Ls for continuing operations, as well as for revenue from continuing operations by end market and product type. Participating with me in today's call are Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO; Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO; and Maria Tagliaferro, Director of Corporate Communications. During the first part of the call, Vince and Dave will present our second quarter 2013 results, as well as our short-term outlook. The second part of our call will be devoted to answering questions from our analyst and investor participants. During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain nonrecurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website. I'd ask you to please note that the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed earlier today. The forward-looking information that's provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is May 21, 2013. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Vincent Roche, ADI's President and CEO, for opening remarks. Vincent T. Roche Thanks, Ali, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Before we talk about our operating results and the outlook for the coming quarter, it is true to say that a lot has happened since our last earnings call at the end of February. Many of you sent deep condolences upon learning of Jerry Fishman's sudden passing, and we thank you very much for those. I worked beside Jerry for many years and while, of course, we all miss him greatly on a personal level, Dave and I, along with our senior management team, and the many talented employees of ADI, will continue to do great things together. Our employees are engaged, our customers rely on us more and more as a preferred partner, and the market opportunities for us are vast. Our business priorities remain the same: leadership innovation in our core signal processing technologies; continuously assessing where we play, how we win and aligning our resources accordingly; and emphasizing strong profitability as a measure of the quality and sustainability of our innovation. We believe that our operating performance, supplemented with cash dividends and share repurchases, will continue to drive strong returns for shareholders. As you've seen from our press release, our results for the second quarter were solid. So let's take a look at what actually happened in more detail. Revenue totaled $659 million, up 6% from the previous quarter and down 2% from the same period a year ago. Diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.52, up 18% from previous quarter. Both results were at the midpoint of the guidance we have provided. Our end markets, the revenue growth this quarter was led by Industrial and Automotive customers. Our industrial end markets, which are typically strong in the second quarter, grew 11% sequentially and made up 47% of our sales. The increase was broad-based across all regions and all major application areas within that segment, but was particularly strong in instrumentation and industrial automation applications. A significant portion of our Industrial revenue is serviced through our distribution partners, and during the second quarter, order momentum through the channel was strong and higher than in the prior quarter. It appears that orders and shipments were in good equilibrium as the inventory in the channel remained low. Now while we cannot predict with certainty regarding the short term, these order trends and low inventory levels are positive signs for our Industrial business. Longer term, we are driving innovation to higher levels to ensure that ADI increases our share of the industrial market. Over the past few years, we have been focusing more of our investments toward industrial applications, where mechanical and electromechanical systems are increasingly integrating electronics to provide intelligent sensing and control, connectivity and energy efficiency, which are all themes that we believe will drive growth for this broad and diverse market over the long term. In the automotive sector, revenue increased 14% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, reflecting strength in North America and China for the auto sector, and growth in worldwide luxury vehicle sales for ADI is especially well represented. This end market was 19% of our total revenue in the second quarter. Sales increased sequentially across our focused applications in powertrain, infotainment and safety, with particular strength in active safety, advanced driver assistance systems. These systems are seeing accelerating adoption rate, not only in premium vehicles, but also in mainstream vehicles as these new safety features become standard equipment, whether due to consumer demand or indeed government mandate. We also experienced strong growth from start-stop powertrain applications for internal combustion engines and also battery control for hybrid electric vehicles. These features improve fuel efficiency and reduce carbon emissions and are also driven by growing consumer demand and government mandates. The automotive industry premium brands are the drivers of innovation, and these are the brands that have adopted our MEMS gyroscopes, accelerometers, converters, RF and other analog and DSP technologies. We continue to distinguish ADI as an innovation partner and a high-quality supplier with industry-leading reliability ratings. As electronic content in vehicles continues to grow, ADI is well positioned, as demonstrated by our results over the last 5 years with our automotive business growing at a 16% CAGR while vehicle unit growth averaged a 3% CAGR over that period. In communications infrastructure, sales were down 2% after being down 12% in the prior quarter, and this business represented 19% of our total sales in the second quarter. Communications networks, both wireless and wired, are transitioning too, and these transitions present a strong long-term opportunity for ADI's broadband radio, optical and cable infrastructure technology. In wireless infrastructure, the major transition everyone is watching is from 3G to 4G and TD-LTE. In wired infrastructure, new equipment with higher levels of throughput such as 40- and 100-gigabit optical and emerging standards, such as cable DOCSIS 3.1, will form the core Metro and EDGE networks in the future and create growth opportunities for ADI. As our results in the last 2 quarters have shown, we are in the early stages of these transitions. For example, the transition to a new wireless standard happens in a couple of phases. Initially, carrier capital spending is focused on coverage more so than capacity, and subscribers upgrade their devices and their service agreements. But the need for increased capacity soon becomes clear as networks become overloaded, and carriers find it difficult to deliver significantly higher data rates and increased capacity with their existing equipment. Increase in capacity is highly dependent on high bandwidth, spectrum efficiency and network densification, where ADI's considerable wideband radio technology brings significant competitive advantages for our customers and in turn, for the carriers. Now in wired applications, our focus is primarily the design challenge around signal integrity, as well as the data path, transmit and receive. Our interface clock and data recovery, and power management solutions, are used to control and monitor signal propagation in optical and cable infrastructure, which are being upgraded to support 40-gig-plus speeds. And finally, the Consumer business was 15% of sales in the second quarter, which was down from 17% of sales in the prior quarter. We saw sequential growth in line with improving seasonality in the applications where ADI's technology has been well established over many generations, such as digital imaging and prosumer audio/video applications. Portable devices declined sequentially but were up significantly year-over-year, in line with customers' new product cycles. As we've mentioned before, there are many good opportunities ahead in portable devices and consumer audio and imaging for ADI. We continue to be highly selective in our engagements, focusing on applications where customers value our innovation, and pursuing engineering challenges where we can leverage our existing core technology and make a demonstrable difference to the user experience. So with that, I'll turn you over to Dave who will now take you through some of the details of our financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Vince, and good afternoon, everyone. As Vince mentioned, second quarter revenue increased 6% sequentially and declined 2% year-over-year to $659 million. Our gross margin was 64% in the second quarter. This was up from 62.7% in the first quarter due to higher factory utilization and lower manufacturing costs. As has been the case now for several quarters, we again carefully managed production levels in our facilities. Utilization increased from the mid-50s in the first quarter to approximately 60% in the second quarter, while our inventory declined on our balance sheet by $8 million. Inventory on our balance sheet on a dollars basis is now at its lowest level in 5 quarters. On a days basis, inventory was down from 121 days in the prior quarter to 115 days in the second quarter, in good position relative to our model. Our plan is to increase utilization in the third quarter to the low 60s. This should keep our days of inventory approximately flat to second quarter levels. Inventories distribution on a dollars basis was approximately flat in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, but inventories distribution on a days basis was lower than the prior quarter by about 0.5 week at 7.5 weeks. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. Total end customer orders, which include both OEM and distribution, increased in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, and our book-to-bill was slightly above 1. On a regional basis, orders improved across all regions, with particular strengths in North America and Europe. Overall, order patterns improved throughout the quarter. Regarding operating expenses, we recorded approximately $6 million of additional expense in the second quarter related to the onetime accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation. Excluding this special item, operating expenses were $224.5 million compared to about $223 million in the prior quarter, which as a percent of revenue, is 170-basis-point improvement. We continue to be very watchful of operating expenses and plan on reducing operating expense ratios by constraining expense growth to rates that are less than our sales growth rates in the coming quarters. Operating profits before tax for the second quarter, excluding this onetime expense, were $197.7 million or 30% of sales. This was about 300 basis points higher than the prior quarter's operating profit of 26.9% of sales, excluding a special charge in that quarter. Other expenses of $3.7 million in the second quarter was flat to the first quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense at current debt levels. Our second quarter tax rate was 16.5% excluding onetime items, and we expect our tax rate to be at that level for the next 2 quarters. Diluted earnings per share of $0.52, excluding special items, was at the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow in the second quarter continued to be very strong. We generated 38% of our revenue or $252 million in operating cash flow. CapEx was $26 million, resulting in free cash flow of $226 million or 34% of revenue. Our cash and short-term investments balance increased about $185 million during the second quarter and now stands at $4.2 billion, with $1.2 billion available domestically. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $760 million in debt outstanding. Our accounts receivable balance was up $4 million versus the last quarter on higher overall shipments in the quarter, and our days sales outstanding decreased to 46 days from 48 days. During the second quarter, we returned approximately $109 million or a 49% -- 48% of free cash flow to our shareholders, primarily through cash dividends. On May 20, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on June 11, 2013, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2013. At the current stock price, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%. I'll just take a moment to talk about our long-term shareholder return strategy. Since 2004, we have paid a quarterly dividend and increased it 10x over that period. In addition, we have repurchased approximately 129 million shares, driving shareholder returns even higher. In total, over that period, we have returned over $6 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. So over the last 3 years, we have returned to shareholders an average of approximately 60% of our free cash flow. And what I'd like to say today is that over the next 5 years, we plan to increase that ratio to average approximately 80% through a program of both increasing dividends and disciplined buybacks. Of course, quarter-to-quarter, we'll be above or below this, but over the 5 years, this is our new target. In summary, the second quarter delivered good results for ADI. Our operating model turned a 6% sequential increase in revenue into an 18% sequential increase in diluted EPS at relatively low levels of utilization. We have plenty of leverage ahead as sales increase, factory utilization improves from its current low levels, and we continue to tightly control operating expenses. So now I'll turn the call back over to Vince who will discuss ADI's outlook for the third quarter. Vincent T. Roche Thanks, Dave. Our lead times continue to be short, which limits our visibility somewhat and, as you know, the world economy remains uncertain. In addition, the last month of our third fiscal quarter is the July month, which can sometimes be weaker due to summer shutdowns. Having said that, order momentum is positive, and if this positive momentum continues, we are likely to see sequential revenue growth in the third quarter, which could be, we believe, as much as 4%. However, if the macro economy weakens, we could be approximately flat. Therefore, we're planning for revenue to be in the range of $655 million to $685 million. The midpoint of this range would be in line with the average third quarter growth rate we have seen over the last 5 years. By end market, we expect our Communications, Automotive and Consumer businesses to remain approximately flat to second quarter levels. We're planning for our Industrial business to grow sequentially, given low channel inventory and good end-customer order rates. We are forecasting gross margins to increase approximately 50 basis points from the 64% we achieved in the second quarter. Though factory utilization is planned to be higher in the third quarter, it will still be quite low, yet if we achieve the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we will generate more than 90% gross margin drop-through on incremental sales. Our plan is for operating expenses to be approximately $226 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of a full quarter with the annual salary increases that went into effect in April. Based on these estimates and excluding any onetime items, diluted earnings are planned to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.56 in the third quarter. So in conclusion, we see momentum, order rates are solid and inventories are low. We are well positioned to expand margins as factory loading increases and expenses remain under tight control, and also to continue generating strong earnings leverage and strong free cash flow, which as Dave discussed earlier, we will use to further improve shareholder returns. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Vince. [Operator Instructions] So with that, operator, we are now ready for questions from tonight's participants.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Guys, is there anything notable about linearity of orders in the quarter? And is there any different -- difference in segment relative to that linearity? David A. Zinsner Actually, I think I even mentioned in the prepared remarks. Actually, the orders strengthened through the quarter, so that was obviously a positive sign. Clearly, Industrial was stronger than the others, which is why in Vince's outlook, he suggested that, that one had the best likelihood of being up in the third quarter. Vincent T. Roche Yes. We've also seen a little momentum in the latter part of the quarter in the communications infrastructure segment. So coupled with the industrial area, they were the 2 sectors that produced most momentum through the quarter, particularly in the latter part, as Dave said. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Helpful. And then any turns assumptions differences relative to previous quarters or similar kind of turns being assumed to get to the midpoint of the guidance? David A. Zinsner Jim, it's -- I think I've mentioned probably every quarter since I've been here it's tough to use the turns calculation, in that backlog includes orders from the distributors on us, and the revenue isn't necessarily the same as it's shipped through to the end customer. But having said that, we're in a very short lead time environment. We've been in this lead time environment for many quarters now. I'd expect that the turns will be pretty similar to what they were in prior quarters. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division I wanted to drill into your capital return target a little bit more. Clearly, I think you said 80% is going to be the rate which you target going forward. Can you provide us just your sort of qualitative context for deciding between buyback and dividend yields? And in general, what's the appropriate dividend yields or free cash flow payout for ADI? David A. Zinsner Yes. We generally don't look at cash or -- yes, we generally don't drive the dividend based on yield. We drive dividend based on looking at our earnings and giving out a percentage of those earnings in the form of a dividend. It just so happens that it translates into this 3% yield, although we're mindful of it. It's certainly something that we pay attention to, but it isn't the major driver of how we drive the dividend. Our goal is dividend is our primary means of returning cash to shareholders. We want it to continue. We want it to grow as earnings grow. And we look at the buyback as more of our opportunistic opportunity to enhance the cash going back to shareholders, albeit at different intervals depending on the stock price relative to kind of historical levels. And then what was the second question, Terence? I missed that part. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division So I wanted to just understand what the trade-off was in terms of you thinking about allocating toward dividend, but I think you may have answered that question. If I could actually ask a different follow-up question, Dave. As I look at the second half of the fiscal year and also looking at context of last year, we saw really Consumer accelerate quite a bit and really outgrow Industrial. I was just wondering, for purposes of considering gross margin, as we look at the second half of this year, should we, again, expect another acceleration in Consumer in the second half? David A. Zinsner Well, generally -- and Vince, feel free to chime in, but I think that we would normally expect, and we'll just have to kind of wait and see how it goes, that Consumer generally has a seasonally strong fourth quarter. And so there's, at this point, no reason to expect otherwise, although it's early and we don't have any bookings yet. What we're hoping is that also Industrial continues its momentum. Last year, there was a bit of a redirection on the Industrial business in the back half of the year as kind of overall economic sentiment started to deteriorate through the back half of the year. And so Industrial's mix kind of came down, but we're hopeful that this is the start of recovery and we don't see that. But again, it's early. We'll have to kind of be watchful of both. The good news is that the margins -- the gross margins if that's kind of the lead in to the question, does mix change? I don't think the mix changes too dramatically because all the margins in all our end markets are actually pretty good and pretty close to the corporate average. So regardless of what happens, I think we'll do a pretty good job of seeing gross margin leverage through the back half of the year, assuming conditions continue to be strong. Vincent T. Roche Yes, to add a little color to what David said. We're in the transition between 3G and 4G in wireless infrastructure, and as that gains pace, we're very well positioned as a company with good market share, a lot of good design coverage and extra bill of materials value in 4G compared to 3G. So as that starts to gather steam, which we hope is sometime in the second half of the year, albeit -- so far, the carriers have been fairly skittish. But somewhere, we believe, in the fourth quarter into the early part of the coming year, we do expect to see the carriers start to accelerate the buildout of their networks in terms of capacity rather than coverage. So I think that will help the margin structures and the growth overall for the company. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Hey, Dave, on the new -- the cash flow guidance on the 80% of your free cash flow, can you remind us what your normal domestic operating free cash flow is? And can you help us thread together how you get to an $0.80 -- 80% payout over time. Because I think, if I remember correctly, that your domestic cash flow is something around 1/3, so just trying to get some clarity on that. David A. Zinsner It certainly can be -- it's a little bit lumpy so some quarters, it can be as much as 50%, some quarters, it could be lower than 30%. What we have is we have $1.2 billion or $1.1 billion of U.S. cash. We'll certainly utilize some of that cash to ramp up the cash flow to shareholders. And then on top of that, I would expect we would be able to add leverage, if necessary, to augment the cash we have and the cash flow we're getting from the U.S. entity to enable us to get to the 80% level. We've stress tested this level to make sure that under different scenarios, based on what happens from an economic perspective over the next 5 years, we would still be able to achieve the 80%. And we feel more than comfortable that we can get there. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research And no change to your longer-term tax outlook in terms of incentive? David A. Zinsner No -- yes, this will not influence the tax story. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. And then just another final one. On the Automotive side, you had very good growth in Q2, it's flattening out in Q3. What are some of the signals you're seeing as we get into the back half of the year from the Automotive end market as it relates to how you think that's going to evolve for the back half? Vincent T. Roche Well, I think there's been brisk building of demand in the first and, particularly, the second quarter. We've seen a little tapering in demand from the automotive customers. And also when we get into the summer period, you very often get just the seasonal vacation cooldown. So overall, the long-term growth, we're very, very bullish about, we're very confident about. But in the third quarter, we're just a little cautious based on immediate demand pattern. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao with Bank of America. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division A question on communications. Sales, was disappointed in the April quarter, and you had a couple of quarters of year-on-year growth earlier. And it seemed to have turned the corner, but now it's down again year-on-year. So first, what caused the miss in April quarter? And second, I would have assumed that the shift in CapEx towards 4G and 3G would've helped offset some of the spending sluggishness. Just wondering why hasn't that been the case in your comps business for the last 2 to 3 years? Vincent T. Roche Well, I think we've had, over a 5-year period up to our fiscal '13 year, we had growth in our wireless business of around 9% compounded. And I think what we're seeing is a certain level of caution on the CapEx layout by the carriers, that's for sure. There's been a delay in the rollout of the next generation of the Chinese system, it's been delayed. Europe, in general, I think has been very slow. Our growth has been largely driven by American -- our OEMs who sell to American carriers. That's been quite strong, and America's been aggressive in building out the 4G network. But largely, again, as I mentioned in the script, really just building a coverage footprint rather than densifying the network or building a lot more capacity, which is going to happen. So we're still reliant very heavily on 3G, and I think what we expect to see is 3G will start ramping down over the next 12 months. We expect to see 4G ramp up, and at that point, I think we'll be very well positioned to take share, see growth and get back into the high single-digits, low double-digit compounded growth rates. I think it's more -- it certainly it is how the market is performing rather than our technology -- certainly from a technology standpoint. From a competitive advantage standpoint, we're in better shape than we've ever been. As you know, we've been steering a lot of R&amp;D into building the underlying technologies in the products over the last 3 or 4 years, and we're starting to see the benefits in terms of design ins. And our engagements are stronger than they've ever been with the key OEMs. So it really is more about how the market performs than ADI. Ali Husain Aashish, do you have a follow-up question? Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Yes. The only one would be on Automotive. I think you highlighted North America and China being strong this quarter. And I think some of the European data points have been somewhat weaker. So just any color on what your current exposure is and how you see that changing over the next couple of years? Vincent T. Roche Well, we're strong in -- with all the major players, when it comes to safety, infotainment and powertrain applications, we have tremendous share in all those applications. So my sense is our business has been largely based on strength geographically in Europe and America over the last 5 or 7 years. We continue to gain share in these regions. But over the last couple of quarters, we've had some very good breakthroughs as well in Asia, in particular in Japan. So one of the things I think we mentioned, we've talked about it various times is that we've been very heavily focused on expanding our reach into Asia, and that's beginning to really pay dividends for the company. So again, I think it's more about how the market performs than ADI. We're in good position from customer penetration standpoint and the technologies we have are being adopted more and more into the applications that I've outlined here. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division I just want to follow up more on the guidance, Vince. It seems like your commentary was that the order book was relatively okay. You made some comments on the Auto order trends falling off. Just more broadly, was it just in Autos where you saw a little bit of weakness and kind of where are you adding the conservatism? Vincent T. Roche Well, we're expecting the third quarter, we're expecting momentum from the Industrial business. As I said, up to now, the order patterns have been strong in Industrial. That gives us a lot of encouragement. And as long as those order patterns continue, as I've said in the script, we believe that our revenues in infrastructure, Automotive and Consumer will be relatively flat in the third quarter. So I think I see Industrial order patterns continue. I would feel bullish about hitting the upper end of the range that we've presented to you today. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Okay. And then I just wanted to better understand the comments in Consumer. It seemed like you mentioned you were trying to be selective, and that's understandable given that segment with the gross margin profile and such. I just wanted to understand that you also said that you expected a ramp in the back half. Is -- can you just talk about how you've approached business selection there? And you had a very strong ramp last year. When you say a ramp this year, are you talking similar magnitude? David A. Zinsner So I think, since I answered it, I guess I have -- should answer this one. I don't want to suggest that we think we have some massive ramp. I mean what we're just -- in the context of mix, normally, Consumer has a better fourth quarter, and that's all that I was suggesting. We're not going to get into guidance, really, for the fourth quarter because that's what we do in the third quarter. Vincent T. Roche Yes, so when we talk about. We have we -- I might have explained before, our Consumer business has a few different components to it. We have a very horizontal or a very diverse business in areas like broadcast and prosumer, as we call it, audio/video imaging applications, with a more kind of catalog type products that are very diversely used across all the major regions of the world with companies who build broadcast equipment, professional equipment for enterprises and so on. That's a good foundation business for ADI. When we talk about picking our spots carefully, we are really referring to the portable areas, all types of equipment, be they tablets or smartphones. We still have a business in the digital camera space. When we talk about being careful, we try to define the end application very carefully from a user standpoint to be able -- and we try to describe that application over multiple generations, so that we can be sure from an application standpoint that we're really delivering value that consumers ultimately will be excited about. So we -- also, when you play in the consumer space, the -- obviously, the life cycles are very, very short. You've got to be able to play through multiple generations. And for each application that we play in, typically, we have to have a couple of concurrent design themes in play to be able to get the generation sequentially synching, so that we exit from one generation but we have the next generation ready to play straightaway. So it's -- sure, it's an expensive place to play from an R&amp;D standpoint, but the returns are great when you pick the applications carefully and get with the right customers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division It relates to gross profit margin and the contribution margin on the gross line going forward. Can you remind us of the manufacturing strategy in terms of which end markets are more heavily outsourced versus made internally, so where we could think about getting operating leverage on the gross line? David A. Zinsner Yes. I mean, there's products manufactured internally that target all end markets, but I would say there's a bias, a slight bias, towards the Industrial end market. So as the Industrial grows, that does utilize the internal facilities a bit more. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division That's great. And then one that I think you answered at least partly before but I'd like to just dig into it again. It sounds like you're telling us that while Automotive was very strong, the order pattern fell off at the end of the quarter. And we've also heard of some less robust end market data points, and notwithstanding the content growth story that we all understand is going on in semis, I think there's some concern that there's been a lot of strength, in particular in the most recent quarter, that you set yourselves and others have demonstrated in this end market. But the OE demand doesn't look as robust. Can you help us understand whether there might be an inventory build going on in that market? Vincent T. Roche I think the way to look at that market, Europe has been very, very muted from a car sales standpoint, although there are indications that I've seen over the last few weeks that new car registrations in some of the European countries are starting to pick up again. So I think it's more about how the geographies are playing out rather than anything underlying in the consumption patterns, demand and consumption patterns. So my sense is that certainly from our standpoint, I think the inventories are quite lean in that area, the automotive area. And it really is more about how the market is behaving at the geographic level than anything else. Operator Your next question comes from the line of the Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee. Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division Just on the same Automotive line, I was wondering -- I mean, Europe is, obviously, a big portion for you, 40%. It's been a little slow in the first half. Do you see it picking up in the second half? And also in China, there's been some concern about tariffs coming back on China because -- is that how you see? I guess, some more color on both those regions. David A. Zinsner So the first question is whether you see European car sales coming back. And I think you've answered that, which is that is an area where we released our early read from external sources and that registrations appear to be growing in that space so there is some reason to be positive. Having said that, I mean, the European car manufacturers end up selling all over the world. And there's some big consumption in other markets for some of the premium brands that are manufactured in Europe. So we're not necessarily at the mercy of the economy over in Europe. So that's, I think, one significant point. The other question was -- what was the question? Ali Husain It was tariffs and... David A. Zinsner Tariffs, yes. I mean, I'll -- Vince can answer that if he wants to, but I don't think we have enough clarity. We're not selling cars. So I'm not sure we have enough visibility into what's going on with the Chinese government and how they're going to manage internal versus external manufacturing of autos. Did you have a follow-up question, Vijay? Vijay R. Rakesh - Sterne Agee &amp; Leach Inc., Research Division Yes, sure, sure. In Industrial, what were the key markets there for you? And what signs are you seeing that gives you optimism on the second half on Industrial? Vincent T. Roche Well, the strongest 2 sectors -- I mean, we grew everywhere. All of the sub-applications in Industrial grew for ADI. The strongest were instrumentation, as well as industrial automation, things like factory automation, process control. They are our 2 biggest subsectors in Industrial, and both of them grew very, very well during the quarter. So typically anywhere in the second quarter, we see good -- very good seasonality in the industrial area. But -- and as we said, the order patterns that we're seeing in the industrial area at large, big customers, small customers, all regions are performing quite well today. So based on that, based on what we hear from our customers, we believe inventories are very, very lean, by the way, and that there's a good match between supply and demand in that area. So turns rates are quite high at the present time as well. Our distributors have also told us the same thing, at least our 2 major distributors, so the -- and there are good macro trends in place as well that we've discussed from time to time around safety, connectivity, efficiency, productivity that make this a very -- a more and more attractive space for ADI, given our breadth of technology and given our reach across the globe with large and small customers. So I think at the present time, what we're seeing is primarily a seasonality effect, but demand continues, at least in the short term, briskly in the industrial area. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with ISI. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division First question on the wireless infrastructure piece. Vince, you noted it strengthened at the end of the quarter but you're guiding the quarter flat in that segment into July. I'm just curious as to how we reconcile sort of the momentum at the end of the quarter versus the flat guide? And your comment on the delay with respect to the transition in China, is that a new comment or is that still implying that we should start to see some kind of a ramp in the... Vincent T. Roche Yes, well -- first off, the delay, our business is -- the largest part of our business in wireless communications infrastructure is still 3G, it's about 70% of our total. So the transition to 4G creates a new opportunity for ADI, and that's just taking a bit longer than we all had anticipated. So it's also a bit of a lumpy business. It's very hard to read. At the end of the day, our customers' customers, they're the carriers, are -- I think there's no great momentum, there's no great pattern in their spending at the present time. So it's just very hard to read. So that's why we're being cautious. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then, I guess, my -- as my follow-up question for...check that [ph]. As a follow-up question, Industrial has done well. It was up double digits last quarter, implied in the outlook as something like 4%, 5% sequential growth, given that it's half the business, and the other businesses are flat sequentially, which brings it sort of back to the peak run rate you had in the Industrial business last year. So I guess, my question is do you feel, at this point as you exit the July quarter, you'd be caught up with consumption, understanding that this is hard to ascertain with finality but what's your best sense? David A. Zinsner I'll take this one. I think it's obviously very difficult to read 60,000 customers to know for sure what their inventory levels are. Having said that, we do seem to be, at least as you look at distributors running at levels that are pretty consistent with their end demand. My best guess is that we are somewhere around where end demand or end consumption is. But I think what really is driving this kind of similar levels to last year is more around just kind of a lot of economic uncertainty that continues to overhang the market. So hopefully, as the year progresses, there is more confidence around the economy globally, and things continue to improve throughout the year. But at this point, it's hard to say. I mean, I think we're at least hopeful, given that the outlook at the moment is that Industrial will be up, as you said, reasonably well. That we're on the course of a recovery. But again, we're just going to have to wait and see how it goes. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Vince, with regard to the products, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about converters from the perspective of the fact that it looks like that's up 1% year-over-year. I guess, probably the best-performing category, and I think that's -- the growth there is better than overall company revenue growth. So obviously, you guys continue to do well in that category. Can you talk a little bit about strategy there? How do you go to market versus, I don't want to say specifically TI, but obviously they're a big player in that space than the other guys. How do you continue to sort of dominate the market? Vincent T. Roche Yes, it's a good question. So converters for ADI are pervasive in every application in which we play. Every one of those segments that we've talked about today use converters, either high-speed or precision. We -- when we think about allocating our R&amp;D, we think first and foremost, that the underlying core technologies and products and make, we insist on making sure that we have adequate coverage in terms of R&amp;D to be able to develop the underlying technologies and products. The converter space is an area where we have the broadest portfolio. If you look at any federal [ph] converter, any particular performance dimension of converters in precision, in high speed, we cover the entire thing. We have teams working on new generations of technology that we haven't even introduced to the market yet, so we are pushing innovation in the core products that are critical to ADI's prosperity in the short term. We're also pushing very, very long term new architectures, new process technologies and combining converters also in many new ways in new applications. So the -- in the infrastructure space, for example, in communication, the wireless part of communications infrastructure, our converters form the heart of these wideband radio transceivers that we developed that have a lot of RF technology onboard. That are more and more linking up with the power management solutions that we have, linking up with the clocking solutions that we have. So it's a vast portfolio of standard products, products that are more highly integrated with converters at their core. And as I said, we, first and foremost, make sure that our core technologies are getting adequate investment to ensure that ADI keeps leadership position and keep -- we keep gaining share. We have been gaining, by the way, over the past number of years, just about 1% market share per year versus the competition on a compounded basis. So 1 point per year. So we're in good position, we've lots of new applications. For example, I would like to point out that in the automotive area, when you look at -- we talk about battery technology and intelligent battery systems. Again, that's a great example of where our converters, our precision converters, are being used in new ways and new applications in a critical application in the car. So there are many, many new areas where we play. And then if you look at the industrial area, we have -- perhaps, we've thousands of products that are selling thousands of converter products with very, very long life cycles. So we have a tremendous mix in terms of the market that we cover, the types of technology that we're developing and the types of customers to whom we sell. Ali Husain I think these are called converters with attitude right, Vince? Steve, do you have a follow-up question? Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Yes, sure. Dave, with regard to the 80%, how do you decide 80% is the right number versus some other? And if you were to, say, use some cash to pay down debt, is that in that 80% or is that something different? David A. Zinsner So first of all, just to clarify the 80% number, make sure that's crystal clear, that's 80% of total free cash flow, not 80% of domestic cash flow. Hopefully, that was clear. But how do we come up with it? We ran -- it's like I said, we ran some scenarios around business conditions. We added in some other potential uses of cash on top of that, which in some cases does include the financing side. And what it told us was, given our capital structure and our rating, we could easily manage 80%. I think we're very comfortable with the debt level we have. And so there's no reason when instruments mature that we need to pay them off. We can kind of refinance them assuming rates are attractive, which they clearly are today. We could -- we even feel comfortable going up in debt from where we are today. So we kind of balance all those things together and kind of -- and given Vince's -- one of his stated priorities is to deliver good shareholder return, we thought that this was a pretty reasonable number that we thought investors would appreciate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just one more question on the increased payout ratio. And by the way, I think I speak for the entire buy side when I say kudos for upping it from 60% to 80%. Just a question on the buyback. Your share count has crept up, I think, over the last 4 quarters. Can you just remind us of what's been allocated for the buyback? Has that increased? And is your methodology for buying back shares going to change at all? David A. Zinsner So we have, I think, roughly $500 million plus, maybe it was $540 million or something like that. Ali, do you know the number off hand? Ali Husain 560 David A. Zinsner $560 million of authorized -- our authorization on the current buyback, although it's pretty simple to get that increase to support the 80%. I think it will need to be increased, candidly, to get to the 80%. But let's see how earnings go, we don't -- the dividend, how that ramps, too, because that certainly an area that we want to increase over time as well. What was the other part of the question, Chris? Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Yes, Dave, I think we've talked about this before. One of the -- I guess one of the good problems that you have as your stock has steadily climbed up, you haven't really... David A. Zinsner Yes, yes. Yes, so that has been the case. I think in my prepared comments, I used the word disciplined repurchases or something of that nature. And that's kind of the way we're going to approach it. So it's not going to be 80% every quarter. In some quarters, it's going to be higher than 80%. Some quarters, it's going to be lower than 80%. But over the 5 years, it will average 80%. But we still intend to be pretty disciplined around the buybacks. And hopefully, buy back when the stock is at least on a historical basis at relatively low levels. So I wouldn't look for us to come right out of the gate and start turning a buyback. But I think over time, you'll see us be pretty good disciplined buyers of the stock, with the idea that we don't want to see that share count creep in general. Operator The next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division I remember last quarter, you had talked about distribution inventories being extremely low in dollar terms at a multi-quarter low, and so I was a little surprised that they stayed flat. And just can you talk about that dynamic? And then I feel like the end customer inventories that you've been describing is low. We've all felt that way for several quarters. What do you think it's going to take to change that? David A. Zinsner So I think a much more robust demand picture will certainly get distributor -- and a lead time stretch-out will certainly get distributors to begin to stock. We generally keep our lead times tight so we won't be the driver of it, but some of our peers sometimes allow their lead times to extend. And during those periods, distributors generally across-the-board raise their inventory levels. But it's 7.5 weeks. It's a pretty good -- it's certainly at a low level but they've certainly been below that. So it's what I think is a healthy level in a period of recovery. Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Okay, great. And then just on the industrial customer side, on their inventory, I mean, as I said, you've described it as low for, I think, 4 or 5 quarters and I felt the same way. Do you think it's isolated at all in retrospect? As you look back, there's build up in the first part last year then come down or has it been generally lean throughout? David A. Zinsner I think in the second quarter, based on hindsight, they probably did start to build inventory, and then over the third and fourth quarter, potentially even the first quarter, started to bring it back down. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Great. Just a question, a follow-up, Vince, to something you said earlier about the comms business. With 70% of that being 3G-oriented, what sort of substitution effect do you guys see because to be frank, we've been waiting for quite some time for you guys and many other companies that have promised a big infrastructure spend increase. And it seems to me there's a risk that the 3G comes down as the 4G goes up and the total really doesn't move as fast as people have hoped. Can you walk us through the transition and the puts and takes to ADI, please? Vincent T. Roche Yes, I think what we see between the generations is more sophisticated solutions being required from ADI. We get more content. I believe, in 3G systems, we're seeing an average ASP increase for a radio transceiver of somewhere in the region of 20% to 30% depending on exactly who we're selling to and what the feature set is. So I think that chunk of what we expect is primarily due to the ASP increases. We also have -- we've mentioned before that we've greatly increased our R&amp;D in the wireless sector in the past 4 or 5 years to make sure that we can extend our reach, our competitive advantage, in each of the critical macro applications. So I think it's more about -- for ADI anyway, we're very well positioned with our customers, we have stronger solutions than we've ever had, so we're just depending, Ross, on the markets more so than anything else at this point. But everything we hear from the carrier discussions we've had, from our customers, somewhere in the region of -- just to be able to meet the data capacity needs that mobile subscribers are requiring now all across the globe. It's going to require a revamping, an aggressive revamping of the network towards 4G towards the back end of this year and into next year. Ali Husain Ross, did you have a follow-up? Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Yes. Just really quickly, a couple of housekeeping ones, and I apologize if I missed this earlier. Dave, your expectations for utilization and internal inventory as you go into the third quarter? David A. Zinsner Yes, I think we'll be kind of low 60s in utilization next quarter. Inventory levels on an absolute dollar basis may be kind of flattish, but they should come down in days. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division I think most of us recognize ADI's high-quality franchising. You guys are tied to some pretty attractive markets. But when I look at the growth, at least on a year-over-year basis, it's been -- this quarter and the July quarter will be the eighth consecutive quarter that revenue is down year-over-year. And my question is would you guys just chalk that up to a tough end market environment or, Vince, in your new role, are you looking at perhaps some different strategies to improve top line growth? Vincent T. Roche It's a very good question. I think what we're seeing at the present time is really just no real momentum but it's driven by just the macroeconomic everywhere, I mean, across the globe. Even China has not been immune to the macroeconomic malaise in the past year, year plus. We, as a company, we're an innovation-centered company with -- where engineering excellence really, really matters to us, where we have a lot of very, very -- people who care passionately about our customers. So we're going to do everything we can to extend our -- the impact and the speed of our innovation, and just to execute better everywhere to speed everything up in the company and just improve ADI in every dimension of innovation. So I believe that the franchise we have is one of the very, very best in the semiconductor world. And myself with the 9,000 employees are going to make it an even better franchise in the future. So we're working on a lot of things internally to make everything better. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division A couple of questions just quick. David, I'm a little confused by the opening comments. Utilization is going to be up or down in the July quarter, and ditto on OpEx. It just sounds like you guys are still keeping things pretty tight. And I guess, my question is if things were to pick up or does the lack of utilization growth or OpEx growth in July quarter give us a poker tell into how you guys are viewing the October quarter? David A. Zinsner Well, utilization is going to be up next quarter. And I think it was like around 60%, I think it's going to be in the low 60s, consistent with our expectations around the Industrial business for the most part. I wouldn't read too much into our OpEx for next quarter as some indication of the next few quarters. What we're trying to do is really lag the revenue side a little bit because leverage is pretty important to us. And quite honestly, we think we're spending enough money to drive revenue growth. So we're going to just be careful about where we add, make sure we're adding it in the right places that we think will drive good ROI. John W. Pitzer - Crdit Suisse AG, Research Division And then quickly, David or Vincent, can you guys give us a little bit of insight on what big buckets or sub-buckets there are within the Consumer? Is this mostly handset or how do I think about kind of the sub-buckets within that category? David A. Zinsner Okay. We'll answer this one, but we got to like, we've got to stop the follow-ons because we're going to run out of time here. But there's about 4 or 5 subcategories, portable is one of them. It's one of our areas that we think will drive growth but it's by no means a dominant part of that business. We have a digital camera subcategory in there. We have a home entertainment system, which includes, I think, prosumer, which Maria tells me is a real word. There is some computer exposure in that space and then we have a bunch of smaller subcategories that get the \"all other\" kind of classification. So it's a pretty -- from a consumer perspective, it's a pretty diverse set of end customers and applications. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division I have 2 quick ones on the cash return again. You talked about over the next 5 years getting up to 80%. How long does it actually take to ramp to that point? Is this something where we should really expect a step change or is this something that builds in? Second question just really quickly to save time, you talked about -- sounds like mostly dividends and opportunistic buybacks, but over the last few years, it's been primarily dividends. It sounds like you're going to focus on that still. So does the increase in the cash return of what you're talking about really imply a very significant increase in dividends. Is that really how we should be thinking about this in terms of what's driving the cash return? David A. Zinsner Yes, so I wouldn't look at 80% as we're going to try to ramp up to 80%. We're going to try to average 80% over a 5-year period. Some quarters that's going to mean it's going to be plus 80%, some quarters, it might be below 80%. But the average is supposed to be 80%. I don't think next quarter it will be 80%, although we're going to have to see. We haven't changed the approach we have towards buybacks. The buyback aspect of this thing is that we will buy when the historical price is above the current price by some measure. And that's what will trigger the buyback. It's somewhat -- it's to some extent on autopilot, I guess, and we'll just execute when and if those situations occur. My guess is they will occur and that will be a reasonable amount of the 80% free cash flow return. But it's true that the primary means of returning cash to shareholders is going to be dividends. Having said that, I wouldn't expect the dividend per se to ramp dramatically at a rate that's dramatically faster than earnings growth rates. It will, in all likelihood, be at a faster rate than earnings growth, but I don't think it's going to be too dramatic. And that's because we have an expectation that we will buy back stock. And that will be a part of the cash return and it will be a meaningful part of the cash return. Stacy A. Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., LLC., Research Division Got it. But that would... David A. Zinsner We lost him. [Technical Difficulty] Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division You referred the low end of sales guidance being based on the possibility of macro weakening. Are you actually seeing any signs that there could be weakening as we go into the middle of the year? Or is this caveat just based on what we've seen in the last couple of years? David A. Zinsner This is strictly just caution around the just kind of macro side of things. And we have seen no evidence to suggest that. Clearly, we are modestly -- I guess, slightly influenced by what happened last year. Steve, do you want to squeeze that one in? Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Yes, as my follow-up question, I -- if I look at your -- there is a prior reference to converters, but if I look at amplifiers, I -- actually if you look at the year-on-year trend, they actually weakened last quarter. Is there anything fundamental that's driving the weakness? Is it tied to a particular segment such as communications? Can you help us understand that? Vincent T. Roche Well, let me -- it's very, very hard to ascribe the shift in a quarter to any one particular segment or any particular application area. I think overall as a company, we have strong share and we play in the high-performance amplifier area. And I think you have to really look at our share over a long period of time. And just like in converters, these 2 areas form the core. These are ADI's backbone and we've actually been gaining share in the high-performance amplifier space over the last while. So I think looking at these numbers quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter, don't tell you anything because we have been gaining share. David A. Zinsner Yes, the other thing is that in some cases, this stuff is all integrating together and then we have to lump it in into something called other. It becomes an other category and so... Vincent T. Roche An identification issue. David A. Zinsner Yes, so a lot of times the functionality that was a standalone amplifier is not a standalone product anymore and so we kind of classify it in other. Ali Husain Great. Well, we're running out of time and well past the 6 o'clock hour. But, Vince, do you want to come back and do your closing remarks before we sign off here? Vincent T. Roche Sure. Well, firstly, I'd like to thank everybody for participating with us today here. So far we've discussed our results and our trends related to the industry, our markets and our shareholders. So in closing, I want to share with you what I've been discussing with our employees since I took over as President several months ago and what I continue to tell our employees as the CEO of the company. My primary focus is to accelerate ADI's growth. This world will emerge from the economic malaise that has dominated for the past 5 years or so, and when it does, my job and the job of other employees is to make sure that ADI emerges stronger and better. Our strength will be evidenced in the growth rate of our sales and the expansion of our operating profits, which generates earnings leverage and strong cash flow. The domain of signal processing, in which we lead, present an excellent growth opportunity in the years ahead as the world drives for more automation, greener energy, affordable health care, more connectivity and mobility. All of these trends face complex technical challenges, and we have a culture here at ADI that thrives on finding innovative ways to solve very complex problems for our customers. Many competitors also see these opportunities, but none of them have the breadth and depth of our signal processing engineering expertise and our customers also recognize us for this fact. We will focus on solving not only the complex problems, but also the critical problems. And this means we must continuously assess how we allocate our R&amp;D and actively steer investments toward areas where innovation creates the greatest momentum for ADI. More and more, I feel employees deepening their customer engagements, bringing the outside world into the company and defining and solving the critical problems before our competitors do. I firmly believe that engineering excellence, coupled with deep customer market insights, drive superior innovation and superior innovation drives superior results. So I, along with our 9,000 employees will settle for nothing less. So with that, I'd like to thank you, and wish you a good evening. Ali Husain Great. Thanks a lot, Vince, and thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Just a reminder that our Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call is scheduled for August 20, 2013, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time. So thanks, everyone, for joining us tonight. Good night and have a pleasant evening. Bye. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Why Analog Devices' Dividend Is Solid - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "   Although analyzing historical trends is important, we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, dividend analyzer, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion for the financial advisor. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Analog Devices Inc. , as well as its dividend under this framework.Investment ConsiderationsClick to enlargeReturn on Invested CapitalAnalog Devices' DividendAnalog Devices' dividend yield is above average, offering a 3.4% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio.We think the safety of Analog Devices' dividend is excellent . We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year.We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter . As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons:  the higher the ratio, the more \"cushion\" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and  the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Analog Devices, this score is 2.9, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated.In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels . The Dividend Cushion also caught the recent cuts by J.C. Penney Company Inc.  and Supervalu Inc. . Check out this article here to read how we warned advisors about SuperValu's impending dividend cut. We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Now on to the potential growth of Analog Devices' dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the \"cushion\" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for Analog Devices. It simply has fantastic excess cash flow capacity.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss . In Analog Devices' case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium . If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. All things considered, the growth potential and safety of Analog Devices' dividend are attractive, and the size of its yield makes the firm worth considering as a potential income play.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices Beats Estimates on Strong Showing in Europe and Asia - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "  Analog Devices   fiscal second quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents, or 16.2%. Revenue was also better than expectations, beating by around 6.0%. Results exceeded both management and our expectations on revenue and gross lines. Strong revenue growth across product lines, markets and geographies, operating leverage and a lower tax rate contributed to the results. Analog Devices shares reacted positively in after-hours trading, rising 4.5%. Not surprising, since the average positive surprise in the preceding four quarters was just 6.04%. Revenue Analog Devices generated revenue of $790.8 million, which was up 8.5% sequentially, up 18.3% year over year and at the high end of managements revenue guidance of $730-760 million . Around 24% of quarterly revenues were generated in the Americas , Europe brought in 29% , China 20% , Japan 12%  and the rest of Asia 15% . The consumer end market declined both sequentially and from last year, while the computing end market only declined from a year ago. All other markets grew both sequentially and year over year. Revenue by End Market The industrial market generated 49% of Analog Devices total revenue . This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segment. The sequential increase in the last quarter was primarily driven by process control and instrumentation products, although management stated that all other areas also gained momentum in the last quarter. Analog Devices stated that the strength in demand was coming from both large OEM and small players, signifying stronger demand trends. Management was very optimistic about continued growth through 2011, citing strong expectations at Siemens AG  and ABB Ltd , two of Analog Devices largest industrial customers. Energy efficiency, productivity enhancements and security are fueling the increased spending in the segment. Communications generated 22% of total revenue, up 7.8% sequentially and 32.1% year over year. Analog Devices communications business comes from both infrastructure and cell phones, although the focus is on the infrastructure side. The strength in the last quarter was due to the increasing adoption of smartphones, which pushed up data demands in North America, Europe and also China. With carriers scrambling to build capacity to meet the growing demand, wireless infrastructure products, particularly base stations were very strong. Analog Devices stated that TD-SCDMA equipment sales in China was less than 10% of revenue in the last quarter, indicating its strong market position and the level of buildouts in other parts of the world. The company expects buildouts in China to resume in the second half of the year. Analog Devices converters, amplifiers and RF products are solidly positioned across all fast-growing geographies  and should generate substantial growth for the company. Analog Devices continued to see sequential declines in the wired communications segment , although year-over-year comparisons trended up. Consumer generated 14% of revenue, down 8.6% sequentially and 7.5% from a year ago. Analog Devices attributed the decline to weakness in Japan, as well as in certain other parts of the world. Also, while the portable devices market grew in the last quarter, home entertainment aplications were flattish, while digital camera products declined. The automotive segment  generated around 13% of Analog Devices second quarter revenue, growing 12.2% sequentially and 27.3% from the year-ago quarter. The increases in the last quarter were driven by a strong product portfolio that enabled the company to take advanatge of the growing demand for automotive electronics. The global recovery, better credit availability, as well as increasing electronic content per vehicle, especially in the areas of infotainment, safety and fuel efficiency continue to drive results. This, along with increasing demand for high-end vehicles that use Analog Devices products are positives for the company. Analog Devices expressed optimism regarding its ability to continue increasing the dollar content per vehicle, as safety, fuel efficiency and conveniences become essential features of vehicles.  Computing accounted for the remaining 2% of Analog Devices revenue, up 6.8% sequentially and down 13.5% year over year. Management has taken a policy decision to defocus this market, since it is given to commoditization, making margin expansion difficult. Analog Devices stated that the segment was impacted by competitive pricing pressures and uncertain demand in the last quarter. Revenue by Product Line Overall, analog products continued to grow double-digits from the year-ago quarter, while digital signal processing  products continued to slow down. Analog signal processing products  were up 8.9% sequentially and 19.7% year over year. The increase was across all product lines , although amplifiers were the strongest. Converters remained the largest product line for Analog Devices, with a revenue share of over 44%. Amplifiers followed, with a 27% revenue share, while other analog products accounted for 14% of total revenue. Power management and reference products remained at 7% of revenue, up 5.2% sequentially and 20.7% from last year. The strength in this product line is the result of managements refocusing of the business over the last few years.  Digital signal processing products  were up 7.7% sequentially and up 3.7% year over year. Margins Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 67.6%, up 137 basis points  sequentially, up 253 bps year over year and better than managements guidance of 66.5%. Gross margins have expanded sequentially in six of the last seven quarters and the sequential expansion in the last quarter was related to higher volumes, higher utilization of internal fabs and a stronger mix of business. Operating expenses of $235.7 million were up 5.8% sequentially and 16.2% from the April quarter of 2010. However, the operating margin expanded 214 bps sequentially and 571 bps year over year to 37.7%. This was possible because cost of sales, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses all declined as a percentage of sales both on a sequential basis and when compared with the year-ago quarter. Net Profit The pro forma net income was $245.3 million, or a 31.0% net income margin compared to $203.8 million, or 28.0% in the previous quarter and $167.3 million, or a 25.0% net income margin in the prior-year quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share was 79 cents compared to 66 cents in the previous quarter and 55 cents in the April quarter of last year. The EPS was also much better than managements expectations of 65-69 cents. Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same. Balance Sheet Inventories increased 3.8% to $293.8 million, with annualized inventory turns reamining flat at 3.5X. Days sales outstanding  were also flat at 48. Cash generated from operations was around $196.6 million. Analog Devices spent $34.1 million on capex and $66.0 million on cash dividends and $67.6 million on share repurchases in the last quarter. It also raised $370.5 million in debt. Guidance Analog Devices stated that order trends were strong throughout the quarter, with the company ending at a book-to-bill ratio greater than unity. The companys customers in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets have signalled growing demand. Management also expects the consumer market in Japan to recover in the third quarter. As a result, Analog Devices now expects revenue of $765-795 million, representing a sequential decline of 0-3%, or a year-over-year increase of 6-10%. Gross margins are expected to come in at 67-68% and operating expenses to be flat to down slightly sequentially, resulting in earnings per share of 70 to 75 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 70 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, which was at the low end of the guided range. Our Recommendation Analog Devices shares carry a Zacks rank of #3, implying a short term Hold recommendation. While Analog Devices is seeing improving trends for 2011, particularly in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets, the company has no exposure to the computing vertical, which is expected to grow very strongly this year on the back of tablets from Apple Inc , Samsung, HTC, Hewlett-Packard Company  and the like. Analog Devices will not be able to participate in this growth. On the other hand, its results were impacted by the disaster in Japan, so there is a certain amount of uncertainty with respect to its revenues from the consumer segment. As a result, we are more positive about its analog peers Monolithic Power  and Microsemi Corporation , which are ranked #2 , as well as ON Semiconductor , which is ranked #1, implying a short-term Strong Buy recommendation.

"content": "    NORWOOD, Mass.---- Analog Devices, Inc. , a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 3, 2012.   ADI delivered solid results for the fourth quarter, with revenue increasing by 2% and diluted EPS increasing by 4% compared to the prior quarter, said Jerald G. Fishman, CEO. For the year, revenue decreased 9.8% to about $2.7 billion, reflecting difficult economic conditions and prevailing global uncertainty. We nevertheless generated 65% gross margins, 31% operating margins and over $800 million, or 30% of revenue, in cash from operations for the year.   Mr. Fishman continued, Overall orders decreased during the quarter as customers became more cautious and continued to reduce inventories, in many cases to historically low levels. As a result, we began reducing our production levels in the fourth quarter and will reduce them further in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to keep our inventory at appropriate levels. While this will reduce gross margins in the short term, we believe this should provide significant operating leverage when growth resumes.   ADI also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 18, 2012 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2012.   Results for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2012   Revenue totaled $695 million   Gross margin was 63.8% of revenue   Operating margin was 31% of revenue   Diluted EPS was $0.58   Cash flow from operations was $236 million, or 34% of revenue   Results for Fiscal Year 2012   Revenue totaled $2.7 billion   Gross margin was 64.5% of revenue   Operating margin was 30.5% of revenue   Diluted EPS was $2.13   Cash flow from operations was $815 million, or 30% of revenue   Repurchases of common stock and dividend payments to shareholders totaled $505 million   Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2012, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.   Outlook for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2013   The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.   Revenue estimated to decrease in the range of -6% to -12%   Gross margin estimated to be approximately 62%   Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $223 million   Tax rate estimated to be approximately 18%   Diluted EPS estimated at $0.40 to $0.48   Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET   ADI will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone    A replay will be available almost immediately after the call. The replay may be accessed for up to two weeks by dialing 855-859-2056  and providing the conference ID:68650785, or by visiting investor.analog.com.   Non-GAAP Financial Information   This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.   Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.   Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.   Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures   The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Restructuring-Related Expenses. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Tax-Related Items. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company recorded a $13 million tax benefit related to taxes that are one-time in nature. These one-time tax items included the reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit in December 2010, retroactive to January 1, 2010; a reduction in a state tax credit valuation reserve we had recorded in prior years; and a benefit from the increase to the Irish deferred tax asset as a result of the increase in the Irish manufacturing tax rate from 10% to 12.5%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a one-time $10.8 million tax benefit for a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to certain tax matters for the fiscal 2004 through fiscal 2007 tax years. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.   In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company recorded a one-time $3.4 million tax benefit related to the release of a tax reserve for an expired tax year. We excluded this tax-related item from our non-GAAP measures because it is not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.   Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors   Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.   Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Analog Devices  believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.   Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

"content": "  Analog Devices   fiscal second quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11 cents, or 16.2%. Revenue was also better than expectations, beating by around 6.0%. Results exceeded both management and our expectations on revenue and gross lines. Strong revenue growth across product lines, markets and geographies, operating leverage and a lower tax rate contributed to the results. Analog Devices shares reacted positively in after-hours trading, rising 4.5%. Not surprising, since the average positive surprise in the preceding four quarters was just 6.04%. Revenue Analog Devices generated revenue of $790.8 million, which was up 8.5% sequentially, up 18.3% year over year and at the high end of managements revenue guidance of $730-760 million . Around 24% of quarterly revenues were generated in the Americas , Europe brought in 29% , China 20% , Japan 12%  and the rest of Asia 15% . The consumer end market declined both sequentially and from last year, while the computing end market only declined from a year ago. All other markets grew both sequentially and year over year. Revenue by End Market The industrial market generated 49% of Analog Devices total revenue . This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segment. The sequential increase in the last quarter was primarily driven by process control and instrumentation products, although management stated that all other areas also gained momentum in the last quarter. Analog Devices stated that the strength in demand was coming from both large OEM and small players, signifying stronger demand trends. Management was very optimistic about continued growth through 2011, citing strong expectations at Siemens AG  and ABB Ltd , two of Analog Devices largest industrial customers. Energy efficiency, productivity enhancements and security are fueling the increased spending in the segment. Communications generated 22% of total revenue, up 7.8% sequentially and 32.1% year over year. Analog Devices communications business comes from both infrastructure and cell phones, although the focus is on the infrastructure side. The strength in the last quarter was due to the increasing adoption of smartphones, which pushed up data demands in North America, Europe and also China. With carriers scrambling to build capacity to meet the growing demand, wireless infrastructure products, particularly base stations were very strong. Analog Devices stated that TD-SCDMA equipment sales in China was less than 10% of revenue in the last quarter, indicating its strong market position and the level of buildouts in other parts of the world. The company expects buildouts in China to resume in the second half of the year. Analog Devices converters, amplifiers and RF products are solidly positioned across all fast-growing geographies  and should generate substantial growth for the company. Analog Devices continued to see sequential declines in the wired communications segment , although year-over-year comparisons trended up. Consumer generated 14% of revenue, down 8.6% sequentially and 7.5% from a year ago. Analog Devices attributed the decline to weakness in Japan, as well as in certain other parts of the world. Also, while the portable devices market grew in the last quarter, home entertainment aplications were flattish, while digital camera products declined. The automotive segment  generated around 13% of Analog Devices second quarter revenue, growing 12.2% sequentially and 27.3% from the year-ago quarter. The increases in the last quarter were driven by a strong product portfolio that enabled the company to take advanatge of the growing demand for automotive electronics. The global recovery, better credit availability, as well as increasing electronic content per vehicle, especially in the areas of infotainment, safety and fuel efficiency continue to drive results. This, along with increasing demand for high-end vehicles that use Analog Devices products are positives for the company. Analog Devices expressed optimism regarding its ability to continue increasing the dollar content per vehicle, as safety, fuel efficiency and conveniences become essential features of vehicles.  Computing accounted for the remaining 2% of Analog Devices revenue, up 6.8% sequentially and down 13.5% year over year. Management has taken a policy decision to defocus this market, since it is given to commoditization, making margin expansion difficult. Analog Devices stated that the segment was impacted by competitive pricing pressures and uncertain demand in the last quarter. Revenue by Product Line Overall, analog products continued to grow double-digits from the year-ago quarter, while digital signal processing  products continued to slow down. Analog signal processing products  were up 8.9% sequentially and 19.7% year over year. The increase was across all product lines , although amplifiers were the strongest. Converters remained the largest product line for Analog Devices, with a revenue share of over 44%. Amplifiers followed, with a 27% revenue share, while other analog products accounted for 14% of total revenue. Power management and reference products remained at 7% of revenue, up 5.2% sequentially and 20.7% from last year. The strength in this product line is the result of managements refocusing of the business over the last few years.  Digital signal processing products  were up 7.7% sequentially and up 3.7% year over year. Margins Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 67.6%, up 137 basis points  sequentially, up 253 bps year over year and better than managements guidance of 66.5%. Gross margins have expanded sequentially in six of the last seven quarters and the sequential expansion in the last quarter was related to higher volumes, higher utilization of internal fabs and a stronger mix of business. Operating expenses of $235.7 million were up 5.8% sequentially and 16.2% from the April quarter of 2010. However, the operating margin expanded 214 bps sequentially and 571 bps year over year to 37.7%. This was possible because cost of sales, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses all declined as a percentage of sales both on a sequential basis and when compared with the year-ago quarter. Net Profit The pro forma net income was $245.3 million, or a 31.0% net income margin compared to $203.8 million, or 28.0% in the previous quarter and $167.3 million, or a 25.0% net income margin in the prior-year quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share was 79 cents compared to 66 cents in the previous quarter and 55 cents in the April quarter of last year. The EPS was also much better than managements expectations of 65-69 cents. Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same. Balance Sheet Inventories increased 3.8% to $293.8 million, with annualized inventory turns reamining flat at 3.5X. Days sales outstanding  were also flat at 48. Cash generated from operations was around $196.6 million. Analog Devices spent $34.1 million on capex and $66.0 million on cash dividends and $67.6 million on share repurchases in the last quarter. It also raised $370.5 million in debt. Guidance Analog Devices stated that order trends were strong throughout the quarter, with the company ending at a book-to-bill ratio greater than unity. The companys customers in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets have signalled growing demand. Management also expects the consumer market in Japan to recover in the third quarter. As a result, Analog Devices now expects revenue of $765-795 million, representing a sequential decline of 0-3%, or a year-over-year increase of 6-10%. Gross margins are expected to come in at 67-68% and operating expenses to be flat to down slightly sequentially, resulting in earnings per share of 70 to 75 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 70 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, which was at the low end of the guided range. Our Recommendation Analog Devices shares carry a Zacks rank of #3, implying a short term Hold recommendation. While Analog Devices is seeing improving trends for 2011, particularly in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets, the company has no exposure to the computing vertical, which is expected to grow very strongly this year on the back of tablets from Apple Inc , Samsung, HTC, Hewlett-Packard Company  and the like. Analog Devices will not be able to participate in this growth. On the other hand, its results were impacted by the disaster in Japan, so there is a certain amount of uncertainty with respect to its revenues from the consumer segment. As a result, we are more positive about its analog peers Monolithic Power  and Microsemi Corporation , which are ranked #2 , as well as ON Semiconductor , which is ranked #1, implying a short-term Strong Buy recommendation.

"content": "    - Board declares $0.34 per share cash dividend   NORWOOD, Mass.---- Analog Devices, Inc. , a global leader in high-performance semiconductors for signal processing applications, today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2013, which ended May 4, 2013.   We had a solid second quarter led by strong sequential revenue growth from industrial and automotive applications, said Vincent Roche, President and CEO. Excluding special items, operating margins expanded 300 basis points compared to the prior quarter and diluted earnings per share grew three times faster than revenue over the same period, demonstrating the strength of our operating model.   Orders were higher in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, but customers remain cautious given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As a result, our outlook for the third quarter is for revenue to be approximately flat to up 4%, continued Mr. Roche. We are planning for margins to expand as factory utilization improves and for expenses to remain under tight control, which we believe will generate good earnings leverage and strong free cash flow.   ADI also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.34 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on June 11, 2013 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2013.   Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2013   Revenue totaled $659 million   Gross margin was 64% of revenue   Operating margin was 30% of revenue, excluding special items, and was 29% on a GAAP basis   Diluted EPS was $0.52   Cash flow from operations was $252 million, or 38% of revenue   Please refer to the schedules provided for a summary of revenue and earnings, selected balance sheet information, and the cash flow statement for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, as well as the immediately prior and year-ago quarters. Additional information on revenue by end market and revenue by product type is provided on Schedules D and E. A more complete table covering prior periods is available at investor.analog.com.   Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2013   The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward- looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.   Revenue estimated to be in the range of $655 to $685 million   Gross margin estimated to be approximately 64.5%   Operating expenses estimated to be approximately $226 million   Tax rate estimated to be approximately 16.5%   Diluted EPS estimated at $0.51 to $0.56   Conference Call Scheduled for 5:00 pm ET   ADI will host a conference call to discuss the second quarter results and short-term outlook today, beginning at 5:00 pm ET. Investors may join via webcast, accessible at investor.analog.com, or by telephone .   A replay will be available two hours after the completion of the call. The replay may be accessed for up to two weeks by dialing 855-859-2056  and providing the conference ID: 50465143, or by visiting investor.analog.com.   Non-GAAP Financial Information   This release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.   Schedule F of this press release provides the reconciliation of the Companys non-GAAP measures to its GAAP measures.   Manner in Which Management Uses the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management uses non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Companys operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in understanding and evaluating the Companys operating results and trends in the Companys business.   Economic Substance Behind Managements Decision to Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures   The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures were excluded because they are of a non-recurring or non-cash nature.   The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Restructuring-Related Expenses. These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, and other cost reduction efforts. Apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   Stock-based Compensation Expense. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, following the death of the Companys CEO, the Company recorded $6.3 million of stock-based compensation expense due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units in accordance with the terms of his restricted stock unit agreement. This stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effect have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.   The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:   Tax-Related Items. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, the Company recorded a $6.3 million tax benefit related to the reinstatement of the R&amp;D tax credit in January 2013, retroactive to January 1, 2012. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a $6.6 million tax benefit as a result of the reversal of prior period tax liabilities. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.   Why Management Believes the Non-GAAP Financial Measures Provide Useful Information to Investors   Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company.   Material Limitations Associated with Use of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Analog Devices  believes that non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Companys use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.   Managements Compensation for Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures   Management compensates for these material limitations in non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, and non-GAAP diluted EPS by also evaluating our GAAP results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

The categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time. In instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each product category.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Analog Devices' Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Husain, you may begin your conference. Ali Husain Thanks, Samantha. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Ali Husain, Director of Investor Relations. We appreciate you joining us for today's call. If listeners haven't yet seen our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 press release, or our form 10-K, both may be accessed through our website at investor.analog.com. This conference call is also accessible from the same page. A recording of this conference call will be available today within about 2 hours of this call's completion. It will remain available via telephone playback for a period of time and it will also be archived on the IR website. In addition, we've updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;L for continuing operations, as well as historical quarterly and annual information per revenue from continued operations by end market and product type. Participating with me on today's call are Jerry Fishman, Chief Executive Officer; Vincent Roche, President; and Dave Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part the call, Jerry, Vince and Dave will present our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 results, as well as our short-term outlook. The remainder of the time will be devoted to answering questions from our analysts and investor participants. During today's call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for certain non-recurring items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We've included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today's earnings release, which is posted on the IR website. I'd ask you to please note that the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for Safe Harbor from liability, established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing. Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed earlier today. The forward-looking information that's provided on this call represents our outlook as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause our outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of date of the live broadcast, which is November 27, 2012. And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO for opening remarks. Jerald G. Fishman Well, good afternoon to everybody, and thanks for joining our call. As the press release said, our revenues for Q4 totaled about $695 million, which was up approximately 2% from the previous quarter and down about 3% from the same quarter last year. These results were within the guidance range that we provided last quarter and are relatively strong results in what has turned out to be a very challenging environment. The diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which was slightly above the midpoint of our earlier guidance. For the full year of 2012, revenue declined just under 10% to about $2.7 billion, which was a reflection of a poor economic environment for most of our fiscal year, coupled with unprecedented global uncertainty, which severely constrained capital spending in virtually all of our served markets. The only exception was our automotive business, which actually grew 11% year-over-year. But even in automotive, we showed some signs of a slowdown in the second half of 2012. Vince, our new President, our newly appointed President, will describe in much more detail the current trends and the outlooks that we see in each of our end markets. Despite the lower revenues and the uncertainty throughout the year, ADI still produced a very credible result for the year, with gross margins of approximately 65%, operating margins of approximately 31% and operating cash flow of over $800 million, or about 30% of sales. In addition, we enhanced shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases that totaled over $500 million during the fiscal year. We also ended the fiscal year with net cash -- or the gross cash we have less our debt, at over $3.1 billion. Today, it's still a very challenging environment in virtually every region of the world. During Q4, the overall orders decreased at ADI, as customers became increasingly more cautious and our distributors reduced their inventories. We believe in Analog today that our current order rates are below the consumption rates of our products. Our book to bill for the quarter fell below 1, and we're entering Q1 with lower opening backlog than we had when we entered Q4 of 2012. Given the continuing uncertainty out there, we've taken many actions around the company to protect the downside, while ensuring that we'll be ready for a snapback in order rates, which typically occurs with very little notice in our business. First, we began reducing our production levels in Q4, and we're planning to reduce them further in the first quarter to keep our inventory at appropriate levels. While operating our factories well below capacity will certainly reduce our gross margins in the short term, it will provide significant upside leverage, as it has in the past, when revenue growth resumes. During the last down cycle, when our factories were being utilized at about 67%, our trough gross margins were about 63%. During the upturn, when utilization rates approached 80%, we achieved gross margins of over 67%. We're confident in our ability to achieve these gross margin levels, as business conditions improve, as factory utilization increases and as our product mix reverts to more typical and traditional levels for ADI. Just as in the previous cycle, we're keeping our lead times very short, providing very high service levels to our customers and remaining ready for any changes in market momentum. Secondly, we've taken action throughout Analog Devices to reduce our expenses corporate-wide by moving resources to the most strategically relevant programs and away from those programs with less long-term potential. We're also planning to gain efficiencies with our new organization, which more closely aligns our product development programs with our customers' requirements. We're also planning a corporate-wide shutdown over the holiday period to give all our employees around the world a very deserved -- well-deserved rest, after a very challenging year, and this will provide temporary expense relief for Analog during the first quarter. Thirdly, our variable incentive program that is operating for all Analog employees, which is directly tied to our growth rate and our operating margins, will normally modulate expenses in down cycles as it did in the last down cycle. In addition for 2013, we've increased the margin thresholds for incentive payments to levels more consistent with what we believe the business is capable of producing on the average. So therefore, for the same levels of performance, the bonus or incentive payments will be slightly lower. The effect of this change will likely be to reduce incentive payments in -- of 2013, beyond what would be typical and normal in previous times. We believe that these actions will be responsive to the downside, while also preparing us for the upside, which invariably follows in every cycle for ADI over many, many years. So now I'd like to turn the call over to Vince, for some more detail on our performance and the trends in some of the end markets that we serve. Vincent T. Roche Well, thanks, Jerry, and good morning, everybody. Well as expected, our strongest sequential growth was in the consumer end market, which grew by 28% in the fourth quarter. The increase in consumer revenue was broad-based in what was a seasonally stronger consumer quarter, coupled with a strong product cycle for ADI. Our results were particularly good in audio and imaging applications in the portable space. Consumer was about 20% of total sales, up from 16% in the prior quarter. Communications infrastructure grew by 3% sequentially and was higher than our plan coming into the quarter, which is a very good result, especially after a 10% sequential increase in the prior quarter. Wireless infrastructure growth -- drove the growth this past quarter, a combination of consumers who are buying LTE, or 4G ready smartphones, from companies such as Apple, Samsung and others, and ongoing wireless network build-outs in developed and developing economies is leading service providers to upgrade their networks. U.S. providers are advertising, as you know, their LTE networks and enhancing increased CapEx spending plans. We also saw activity in the fourth quarter among our base station customers as they began to respond to China's announcement of TD-SCDMA Phase 6 and the 120,000 sites planned, which is twice the 2011 rollout. While GSM and 3G in particular, are the largest portion of our wireless revenue today, LTE, or 4G, is growing quickly, and will be a very significant growth driver in the coming few years. Communications revenue was 20% of total sales, consistent with the prior quarter. While the first quarter is expected to be steady to the fourth quarter, we expect wireless infrastructure deployments to more meaningfully impact our results towards the end of 2013. Now industrial revenues, which we expected would be stable in the fourth quarter, actually declined 5% sequentially, in line with lower industrial production worldwide as dictated by the ongoing macro weakness and also as a result of continuing reduction in inventories by our industrial customer base. This market represents a myriad of small and midsized customers primarily served through our distribution channel, as well as many of the world's largest industrial equipment makers, and none of these customers had immunity from the decline. Most industrial application already [ph] declined sequentially, including process control, instrumentation and measurement equipment and medical imaging. Regionally, we saw the most pronounced declines in Europe and Japan. Defense and aerospace and medical instrumentation were relatively flat sequentially. The industrial end market represented 44% of total sales in Q4, down from 47% in the prior quarter. On the automotive side, revenue declined by 4% sequentially, mostly as a result of lower unit sales of automobiles in Europe and in line with widely reported factory slowdowns at automotive manufacturers. While the declining revenue reflected the general weakness in automotive, we saw continued strength in newer products for Advanced Driver Assistance and powertrain efficiency systems, as our customers continued to deploy our innovative products in these growth sectors. Overall, automotive represented 16% of sales compared to 17% in the prior quarter. Now on an annual basis, automotive was an obvious bright spot, growing 11% during fiscal '12 compared to FY '11, the third consecutive year of double-digit growth. All major automotive application areas grew year-over-year. Our mix of business in the fourth quarter was anomalous compared to the rest of fiscal '12, as seasonal growth in consumer was further accelerated by new product adoption of key accounts. Beginning in the first quarter, we expect the business to shift to a more typical revenue mix. So with that, I'll hand you over to Dave, who'll take us through the details of our financial results. David A. Zinsner Thanks, Vince. As Jerry had mentioned, fourth quarter revenue increased approximately 2% sequentially to $695 million and decreased 9.8% for the year to $2.7 billion. Our gross margin was 63.8% in the fourth quarter. This was down 180 basis points from the 65.6% we reported in the third quarter and down very slightly from the same period last year when revenues were higher. While an anomalous mix was the key factor, as Vince just described, we also made a decision to further reduce production levels mid-quarter in response to lower industrial and distributor orders, which reduced utilization below our original plan. Utilization decreased from 74% in the prior quarter to 67% in the fourth quarter. Inventory on our balance sheet remained approximately flat to last quarter in dollar terms and was down on a days basis from 121 days in the prior quarter to 114 days in the fourth quarter. Weeks of inventory and distribution was down by 0.5 week and stood at about 7 weeks exiting the quarter, down from approximately 7.5 weeks in the prior quarter, which is a very significant adjustment in a short period of time. Channel inventories are now well below historical levels. Lead times for our direct OEM customers remained similar to last quarter and are in good control, with virtually all of our shipments to OEMs occurring within 4 weeks. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $228 million compared to $230 million in the prior quarter excluding restructuring expense taken in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to tight control of our expense and also due to our variable compensation model, which is linked to our year-over-year sales change and quarterly operating profit. Operating profits before tax for the fourth quarter were $215 million or 31% of sales, down 100 basis points from the prior quarter, excluding restructuring charges taken in the prior quarter and a solid result in the current environment. Other expense of $3 million in the fourth quarter was flat to the third quarter and reflects the ongoing run rate of our net interest expense. Our fourth quarter tax rate was approximately 16%, which represents an adjustment of our annual tax rate from 22% to 20%. We continuously look for efficiencies in our tax structure and based on current assumptions, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 18% for each quarter in fiscal 2013. Diluted earnings per share of $0.58 in the fourth quarter was above the midpoint of our guidance and up 4% sequentially from the prior quarter on a 2% increase in revenue. For the year, diluted earnings per share was $2.13. We generated very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter at 34% of revenue or $236 million in operating cash flow. Capital expenditures were $38 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $200 million or 29% of revenue for the quarter. Our accounts receivable balance was down about $6 million versus the last quarter on lower shipments, and our day sales outstanding decreased to 45 days from 46 days in the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, we purchased $21 million of our stock and distributed approximately $91 million or 51% of our net income in dividends to our shareholders. For the year, we repurchased $161 million of our stock and distributed $345 million in dividends to our shareholders. We plan to continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock and to enhance returns to our shareholders. Since the start of our repurchase program, the company has repurchased approximately 129 million shares, or $4.4 billion of company stock. We have approximately $560 million remaining under our board-authorized share repurchase program. Our cash and short-term investments balance increased $135 million during the fourth quarter and now stands at $3.9 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion available domestically. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $822 million in debt outstanding, from net cash on a per outstanding share basis was slightly above $10. On November 26, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per outstanding share of common stock, which will be paid on December 18, 2012, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7. At current stock prices, this dividend represents an annual yield of approximately 3%. In summary, fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 delivered solid results during what turned out to be a very challenging period. So now I'll turn the call back over to Jerry, to discuss ADI's outlook for next quarter. Jerald G. Fishman Thanks, Dave. Our current expectations for Q1 revenues is for a decline of between 6% and 12% sequentially, which is certainly a larger decline than we'd normally anticipate in a typical Q1 for ADI. The most significant sequential decline in Q1 is likely to be in our consumer business, where our typical Q1 sales decline is exacerbated by inventory drawdowns after our customers prerelease inventory builds in Q4. Based on the current forecasts from our largest communication customers and our largest automotive customers, we expect Q1 sales in those market segments should remain relatively flat to Q4 levels. So certainly, the big swing in Q1 will be industrial sales, which span a broad customer base in every geography. While the United States and Europe still comprise the bulk of our industrial sales, China is becoming a more important component of industrial sales over the past few years than it's been historically. Over many, many years of observation in our industrial business, it's very clear to us that industrial capital spending continues to drive our industrial business. And certainly, those trends have been, and are today, being negatively impacted by economic and tax uncertainties in the United States and in Europe and government actions in China. In addition, many of our largest customers have announced extended factory shutdowns in late December and early January in the holiday period and are continuing inventory reductions. And lastly, our distributors have predicted less than seasonal forecasts for their fourth calendar quarter, of which 2 months overlaps our first calendar quarter. On the other hand, if you want to look at the glass as half full, which some of us do, inventories at our industrial customers and our distributors are at extremely low levels, and our largest customers report that their business levels are stable and in some cases, improving. And that would suggest that they're going to begin to restock. But on balance, we believe at this juncture with the information we have as of now, it's prudent to be very cautious about what ADI's industrial sales are going to turn out to be in Q1, and we're planning for a sequential decline in this market segment in Q1. I think it's very important to note that we could get surprised in this segment. But it's more likely that any real upturn in our industrial business would occur in Q2 rather than in Q1, although it's still early to predict that. In response to the weak demand environment that we experienced in Q4 and that we're planning in Q1, we're planning to further reduce factory operating levels in our production facilities, as I mentioned in my opening comments. In Q1, we're planning our factory utilization to drop from 67% in Q4 to the mid to high 50s in Q1, and for inventory dollars to be down, but days of inventory to be about flat given the significantly lower sales in Q1. As a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 62% in Q1, which hopefully will be the low point of this cycle. It's important to note, I think, that while changing inventory levels at our distributors don't affect our revenues, since we account for revenues worldwide on a sell-out methodology, when our distributors do start to restock to more traditional levels, it does positively impact our factory loadings and therefore positively impacts our gross margins. Given the strength of our position and the high market share that we enjoy in the industrial end markets, we'll be ready when a snapback in industrial does occur, as it always does. This will drive a better product mix, it will drive higher factory utilization and it will drive extraordinary operating leverage, as we demonstrated in previous cycles. We're planning for our operating expenses to be down approximately 2% in Q1 based on the actions that I outlined in my earlier comments, and earnings to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.48 for the quarter. In the longer term, we have an increasingly unique position at ADI, in the analog and signal processing market. We have very strong core technology, particularly in converters, in RF components and other linear functions, in MEMS, in power and in digital signal processing; and a very broad customer base, which provides great stability, but also provides the ability to leverage and bundle this technology into a much more complete and integrated solutions for a customer base that more and more depends on ADI to become their partner. We're now engaging with customers at much higher levels than in the past, and we get consulted and involved in their architectural and system needs at a very early level. And this will certainly pay off in terms of sales growth and higher margins as business levels stabilize in the future. The diversity of our end markets and of our 60,000 customers around the world where no consumer represented more than 5% of our sales in 2012, provide some measure of insulation from economic headwinds and product cycles and also, at the same time, provides the prospect of above-industry growth when the external world stabilizes. Now, we at Analog, the management team and the employees of Analog, have been through difficult periods many time in our history, and we continue to make the necessary trade-offs to position ourselves to respond when the market turns, as they always do. Structural improvements that we implemented in previous years give us an added advantage in navigating difficult periods and allow us to protect the downside while standing ready to capture the upside when conditions get better. Every time we've gone through one of these cycles, we come back better and we come back stronger, and I expect this time will be no different. Ali Husain Great. Thank you, Jerry. Thanks, Vince and Dave. [Operator Instructions] With that, operator, we are now ready for questions.   Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division The first question is related to gross margin. It seems like based on the utilization numbers that you've given of mid-50s for next quarter, it's a fairly pronounced action you're taking in the fabs. I guess my question is what's the motivation of that, given that inventory isn't too high? Is that more to just to set yourself up for a trajectory of extending gross margin in the April quarter? And if revenue were to grow in April of say 4% or 5%, would gross margin also bounce back then? David A. Zinsner So I'll take a stab at it; Jerry can add color if necessary. We're bringing our utilization down to 50 -- mid-50s levels. That is different than what we did last year at this time. We had a kind of a similar decline in revenue. But we allowed our days of inventory to kind of push up to 121 or 122 days last year. This time around, we're really trying to focus on keeping the days of inventory relatively flat, bringing the absolute dollars of inventory both on our balance sheet and the balance sheets of our distributors down. This is a bit different. The idea is it to get the inventories well balanced and then be ready to get the leverage when the business returns to growth. And as you point out, we had a big turn up in revenue in the second quarter. We have a pretty quick acceleration in the gross margins quickly back to the levels you saw us operate in back in a few quarters ago. Jerald G. Fishman Yes, I'd say the other comment, Terry, is that we monitor the order input quite frequently. And just like last quarter, as we monitored the orders, we -- turns for factories down a little harder than we had anticipated. If the order input justifies it -- we don't make these decisions once a quarter, we make them more frequently. And if the orders begin to turn up and we see anything that we believe is sustainable, we can ramp very quickly. And with the levels of inventory that we're carrying, we can respond extremely quickly to any upside our customers provide to us. So I think it's all those phenomena saying we want to manage the inventory responsibly. But we also, at the same time, want to make sure that when business does pick up, that we can respond to whatever our customers ask us for, given that on incremental sales, particularly on the stuff that we build internally, the gross margins are extremely high. So we don't want to miss any of those sales and we don't want to hang any of our customers out to dry. So those are our objectives, really, to keep the inventories under good control and yet, be flexible enough that we can respond very, very quickly to any input order rate increase that we see. Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Crystal clear. And as a quick follow-up, really on the OpEx line. You guys did a terrific job in the prior cycle, really reducing OpEx to help improve the operating margin. But when I look over the past 8 quarters, on a revenue that's about down 15% from where it was 2 quarters ago, you're right at the same OpEx bogey. So we've seen OpEx sort of creep back up the past couple of years. What's the message to investors in terms of OpEx discipline here, as we've seen OpEx creep up a little bit relative to sales over the past couple of years? David A. Zinsner Well, it did creep up a little bit in the third and fourth quarter on a relative basis. But I think if you go back 8 to 12 quarters, we probably were averaging in the kind of the low 220s -- $220 million in terms of OpEx. That's where we're going to go to roughly in the first quarter. So I think what we're doing is prudently reacting to a little bit more difficult environment. I think we've done -- at least, maybe just me, my perception of this, but we've done a very good job just closely managing OpEx to make sure that it doesn't get away from us while revenue is coming off. So I think in the rest of the year, we'll manage it very closely. And Jerry mentioned a number of actions we're taking in the first quarter. We'll continue to look at it every quarter and not allow it to escalate until we see a big recovery on the revenue side. Jerald G. Fishman I think the other perspective on that is that if you look at the OpEx over the last 2 years, for last year -- and I mean our OpEx is the same now, on a running rate basis, as it was 2 years ago. And one of those years had a lot of growth and one had declined. So I think what -- the way we're looking at it, it's hard to look at these things quarter-to-quarter because the revenues fluctuate a great deal. But I think we had very significant operating expense controls in the company, and that the evidence of that is that the operating expenses through a lot of different parts of the cycle have been flat for the last 2 years, roughly. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division For the first question, you had mentioned about the variable comp and how that'll be a little bit lower, or the threshold to have it kick in would be a little bit higher. In general, should we think of it at a given level of revenues now, you're going to have a lower level of OpEx, I guess is the first clarification? Then the second part of the question is with the shutdowns that you're having in the January quarter, what sort of OpEx increase should we look at in the April quarter, assuming the shutdowns don't repeat themselves? David A. Zinsner Yes, the shutdown is relatively modest. It's a couple of million dollars. And I think we have pretty good control over the OpEx; that we won't allow it to go up, unless the revenues start to grow. And even if it does grow, it'll grow at a fairly modest rate. At a given revenue level, there are some other things that kind of crept in that offset some of the decline mostly on the variable comp piece. So some of it's awash and I think OpEx, we're generally trying to get the business to operate in kind of the low 30s, 30% to 31%, 32% of revenue, and that's what we're kind of target to get back to as business kind of grows. Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Great. And I guess as my one follow-up, on the cash flow side of the equation. Can you remind us what your expectations are for CapEx in the first quarter and then for the full fiscal year '13? David A. Zinsner We're targeting to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million for the first quarter. We have a general goal to be in the kind of $100 million to $125 million for the year. It obviously depends on how the business operates. If it -- if we see more of a flattish environment, we'll probably be more towards the $100 million. If things start to grow a bit, we'll probably be closer to $125 million. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aashish Rao of Bank of America. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division My question, Dave, typically ADI's gross margins are more a function of utilization rates than product mix. But you noted the analogous mix due to the shift towards consumer. Could you help quantify the impact of both these factors on the gross margin softness in both 4Q and fiscal first quarter? David A. Zinsner Relative to the prior quarter or? Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Yes. David A. Zinsner I'd say most of the margin shift from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is going to be loading related. Very little of it's going to be related to mix. It'll be slightly beneficial actually the mix. But given that industrial will be down, kind of roughly what the corporate average is down, we're expecting that mix won't be a big factor. So that's fairly, for the most part, mostly loading related. The gross margin shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was pretty much a 50-50 split between mix and loading. Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay, cool. And then one question, Jerry, I wanted to talk about one of the businesses that doesn't get much attention, and that's the DSPs. And your DSP sales have held up fairly well for the last several years and have outperformed your large competitors' embedded division, where sales are down 10% to 15% over the last year. What do you think are some of the reasons why your DSPs are holding up better? And any color on that would be helpful. Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think one reason, I believe, is that we have our -- we don't look at DSP as a sort of separate business on to itself. We're a signal processing company. We look to gear our DSPs towards integration of digital and analog signal processing into more integrated solutions for our customers. I think that selling stand-alone DSPs, and we've talked about that with investors a couple of years ago, is a very, very tough strategy in the market right now. So the real value of DSP for us -- I mean we still sell plenty of individual DSPs, but we also -- and the thing that's really kept it at the levels we need is we're able, from a market segment and a customer standpoint, to provide more complete solutions of analog and DSP together. And that gives us a great advantage relative to most other players in the market. The DSP business is -- we've gotten down to the right expense levels. And I think the group that manages that business have done a pretty good job at doing that, commensurate with what we see the opportunity to be. But we see many, many applications that have developed and will develop in the future, where integrating DSP and analog, very high performance analog together, provides a very compelling solution to our customers. Do you have any other comments on that Vince? Vincent T. Roche Yes, just maybe one other piece of color. In terms of the predominance of the segments in that DSP product revenue basis, really industrial, which is very steady, it's very, very diverse in terms of the number of customers that we serve. And we've also -- in terms of raw growth driver, automotive has been the primary push there. So they're the 2 primary markets that comprise the sales of DSP. And we're pretty well matched, I think, with both of them in terms of the, as Jerry said, a more standard product approach in the industrial space and a more targeted match between our DSP and analog technologies in more complete solutions in automotive. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division If I could follow up, Jerry, on your comment about -- I think you called the order pattern increasingly more cautious. Was that a function of orders went down a lot in the beginning of the quarter and then stabilized? Or did you see a steady decline in the orders over the course of the quarter and into the month of November? Jerald G. Fishman Well, we saw the orders decrease early in the quarter and they did sort of stabilize at those levels for the rest of the quarter. I mean that's the general trend we saw, and I think I'd make the same comments about November. James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then you made the comment that you thought an industrial -- a recovery in the industrial segment was more likely in Q2 versus Q1. Is that a function of seasonality or what your customers are telling you? Or was there anything to read into that? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it's all those things. It's that in Q1 for us, particularly with -- the industrial business is 16,000 customers or something out there. So there's a lot of customers that shut down. It's really a days of sale business for part of that in the broad base, and key account business with the large accounts. So typically, what we see in first quarter and given that there's less sales days is we see a decline in the first quarter. And we see a rebound in the second quarter since it's a quarter that's fully -- that's every day and every week are being worked by our customers. Also, I think given the inventory levels that the distributors are carrying and the customers are carrying, I mean and the amount that our industrial business is down relative to where it was, I mean just -- it's got to snap back. The only question is when it's going to happen. And if historical is a good representation of the future, which in the absence of any information, it is, we could see a snapback in that business in the second quarter. That's what we saw last year when the first quarter was down quite a bit. And in the absence of any other information, at least that's the planning assumption that we have right now in running the business. Now... James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Very helpful. Jerald G. Fishman I mean planning assumptions are just assumptions. But that's our assumption. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from JPMorgan. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division Just a quick follow-up on the bookings question that Jim asked. Is there any sort of common theme or common reason why your customers are telling you that the bookings are falling off? Is it pure inventory? Is it demand? Is it a combination? Is anybody mentioning anything about the fiscal cliff or any other economic problems? Jerald G. Fishman Well, I think it's all those things. I mean you go out to see the large customers and it was interesting this morning, there was -- the CEO of Honeywell was on TV, or yesterday or something. And he's sort of indicative of the kind of things that we're hearing from customers that their business levels are not dead. They're relatively stable. Some are even forecasting some growth next year, but there's so much uncertainty out there. In Europe and the United States, based on the same things about government tax policy, all of the stuff that's going on in the economies, that people are just standing still, and that impacts their capital spending budget, in a similar way to it's impacting the capital spending budget in Analog Devices, that at the margin, people just stop spending money until they can get some certainty. And that's just not rhetoric, that's what CEOs around the world are doing right now. But the part that's encouraging to us is that when we visit those companies, #1, they're really, really excited about our technology; #2, they want deeper levels of engagement with Analog as a technology provider and a partner, and they're saying that their businesses are not declining and they're either stable or getting just a little bit better. So all those things say there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that business that a good dose of courage out there in the political environment wouldn't solve. Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division And my follow-up is probably for Dave. Dave, do you remember when your utilization rates were this low? I think you guys said somewhere in the mid-50s, and what were your gross margins at the last time the utilization rates were this low? And do you have any figure on incremental gross margins as sales start to pick up? David A. Zinsner I think the last time we had utilization at this level was actually in 2009, so gross margins were in kind of the mid-50s. It was a little bit of a different environment, because we had a lot more capacity and business had really fallen off. Absent that, this is kind of an historic low for us outside of the period of time where it was really difficult. Usually, for every 10% improvement utilization, we get about 100 basis points of gross margin improvement. It can vary depending on -- based on mix and there's also loading that we get on the back end, which could be incrementally beneficial. So it has a little bit of a magnifying effect when business conditions improve. But on a rough order basis, I'd say it's at least 100 basis points. Operator Your next question comes from the line of P.J.  [C.J.] Muse of Barclays. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division Yes, C.J. Muse. I guess, first question, I was hoping to dig a little bit deeper on the operating leverage side. And so I guess the first part, as you think about the higher threshold on incentive pay and some of the other actions that you're taking, what kind of incremental savings you would be thinking about looking into calendar '13? And then as a part of that, how should we think about your target in terms of what incremental operating margins should look like in a more normalized recovery period into calendar '13? David A. Zinsner Well, we're roughly saving probably in the neighborhood of $20 million a year with the new bonus structure and equivalent level because, of course, there are other things that go in different directions. I would -- if I were modeling OpEx, I think what I would model is a very carefully managed OpEx growth assuming business recovers in the second quarter, which is one scenario. And then if the business kind of continues to improve, we'll be fairly modest in our growth on OpEx. So we should see leverage on the OpEx side during a recovery. Our operating margins, when we were at kind of peak performance on a revenue basis, were up over the 35% level. I think at its peak, we were up above 37%. And assuming we get back to business levels like that, our operating margins will be at similar levels. It's just a matter of dependent on when the revenue kind of moves in it in that direction. Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division That's very helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up, in terms of the 18% tax rate guide for fiscal '13, I guess, what has changed to enable that to be lower? Are you assuming a greater mix outside of the U.S.? Or is that a tax strategy on your part or reduced expectations for fiscal '13 top line? David A. Zinsner Yes, we're assuming a similar mix of income domestically versus internationally and internationally within each region. This really has to do with just some tax planning that goes on all the time. And some of the benefit of that tax planning is showing up in next year's numbers, at least we expect it to. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Where do you think LTE could be as a percent of mix 1 year from now? I understand it's probably still below 10% currently. And any views on the trends within infrastructures, specifically between base station and small cell? Vincent T. Roche Yes, the -- I would say in the second half of '12, the proportion of our wireless infrastructure business that was LTE or 4G was around 15%. Now I think as we get to the second half of FY '13, that number will probably move to 25% of total. And given that we have increased content to the tune of 20%, 30% depending on the customer from 3G to 4G, that should bode well in terms of revenue upside for the company. Let me see, your second question was regarding? Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. Incorporated, Research Division Base station, small cell opportunities. Vincent T. Roche Yes. Well, I think the thing to remember when you look at macro versus small cell, both are going to exist -- co-exist in the network. And our expectation is that macro will continue to grow. That's what our customers tell us. That's what the carriers tell us. And basically, to help densify the network, to fill a network out, particularly in terms of being able to supply data needs in urban environments, what we'll see is a pretty steep increase in the deployment of small cell. So what we're looking at is a homogenized network that will have coexistence of macro and small, more point-to-point units and obviously more backhaul optical and cable networking as well as to be able to support the movement of data worldwide. So that's pretty much it as we see it. So I think what you'll see is a huge increase in the number of radios that get deployed. And what we sell into the small cell area is a trickle-down from what we develop for macro cell and have been developing for many, many years now. So there's tremendous leverage as small cell becomes more prevalent in the network. Jerald G. Fishman I think just one color comment on that is that the ADI content in 4G is quite a bit higher than it is in 3G. Ali Husain So we have a number of people still waiting to ask questions. If we're unable to get your question within the allotted time, you can reach me after the call at  461-3282, but we will continue and try to get to all the calls that we can. So before we take the last few questions, I'd like to mention that our first quarter 2013 earnings release is scheduled for February 19, 2013, after market close and our conference call will begin at approximately 5 p.m. Eastern Time that same day. So we're ready to take the additional questions now. Operator, may we have the next caller please? Operator Your next question comes from the line of the Doug Freedman of RBC. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division One, could you guys give us a look at sort of the real-time business conditions? I imagine lead times are low right now. And could you give us an idea of what the demand looks like for the month of December, given we're about to start that month? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that would sort of be predicting the future, which I mean we're not -- I mean we don't know what demand's going to be in December. We're cautious, particularly in the industrial business because there'll be a lot of shutdowns, as I mentioned earlier. So I think -- our sense and our internal plan is to just treat Q1 and be very, very cautious about what's going to happen because of the holiday period and all the things I mentioned earlier. So we'll have to just wait and see what happens in December. We just don't know. Vincent T. Roche On the lead time side of the story, we're shipping within 6-week lead times. We're shipping virtually 99% of the entire portfolio to on-time customer requests. Jerald G. Fishman I think the important thing that we're communicating around Analog and I think is worth mentioning tonight is that in the last cycle, when we managed the inventory well, we managed our capacity well and we did very, very well on the upside relative to many of our competitors, who got stuck and couldn't deliver stuff. So I think that's the mantra around Analog is that whatever we do -- and we know we can't predict demand, particularly in these tumultuous environments. But the one thing we can do and that we will do is make sure that we have supply when customers need it, and that's what we're going to do. So we just can't predict in the short term what's going to happen in any month or any week or any -- it's even hard to predict exactly what's going to happen in first quarter. And that's why the guidance range is so wide, and there's so many different factors that would enter into it. Now that's very typical in these cycles because customers know they don't have to give you a lot of lead time, so most of the business again is turns business. It's just the way it is. It's been like that, as you know, for 100 years. It will be like that for the next 100 years. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division All right. Jerry and Vince, I'm sorry, I'm a little confused by that answer, because if lead times are 6 weeks, you would have visibility for the month of December, and that's what I was asking for. I wasn't asking for... Jerald G. Fishman Are you talking about shipments... Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division I was asking for what you're seeing. Jerald G. Fishman Are you asking about shipments in December or orders in December? Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Shipments, what you're seeing from a demand perspective for shipments in the month of December. Jerald G. Fishman I think what we're seeing is commensurate with the guidance that we've provided for December. We don't see anything anomalous to the guidance we've provided. That's how we sort of calculate the guidance. The only -- what I was commenting on is the order rate, not the shipment rate. Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Okay, understood. If I could, for my follow-up, Jerry, if we look back at the year and we go out to the 30,000-foot level, this cycle was not like any that we've seen in any of the past semiconductor cycles. Can you offer some of your commentary on what you think changed over the last year or 2 that has made it that we really didn't end up with what we would call a normal inventory cycle this year, only really seeing 1 seasonal quarter this whole year? Jerald G. Fishman I know, it's confusing, at best. The -- most of the cycles in the semiconductor business are and over many, many years have been based more on supply than demand. And there's always -- the semiconductor industry is always trying to catch up either to the upturn or the downturn and always misses it. So, so many of the cycles are based on just what's low -- how much capacity's there, shortages, double, triple ordering and then a reaction to that. And those cycles, were pretty straightforward and we've seen those many, many times. I think the big difference in this cycle that we've seen is just staggering uncertainty in the customer base, based on partly economic conditions, but also policy issues and tremendous uncertainty of what people are going to do about capital spending, which partially is related to their business levels, but is also related so nobody can figure out what's going to happen in those areas of policy. So I think that that's the difference in this cycle, that I think -- which is why it got shortened from what we'd normally see, why it was very, very to predict in the short term what's going to happen. I continue to believe if the uncertainty gets cleared up and people sort of understand the environment, whatever it is, good, bad or different, I think things will get better. That's our -- that's our sense of what's going on with the market based on what our largest customers and the senior executives at our largest customers are telling us. It's not just an internal theory of Analog. We spend a lot of time out there talking at very senior levels particularly to our industrial customers. And that's what they're telling us, so that's what I believe. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda from ISI. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division [indiscernible] about quantitatively on the turns required for the quarter? Is it similar to what you registered in the October quarter, or higher, lower? David A. Zinsner I think you cut off just a little bit, Sumit. But basically, we don't typically quote turns. We don't even calculate them internally, just because a lot of our backlog is associated with orders from distributors, which don't translate into revenue until the distributors ship out the product to their end customers. But I think it's -- just qualitatively, I think it's safe to say that we're in a high-turns environment with limited backlog going into the quarter. And that's been relatively consistent over the last few quarters. Sumit Dhanda - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And then maybe just some more detail on the consumer outlook for the January quarter. Is the big hit that you're taking in call it the audio business or the imaging business? Or is it not distinguishable in terms of the impact from one versus the other in the January quarter? Vincent T. Roche Well, we've multiple segments or subsegments under the consumer banner, and we typically see a seasonality decline in the 15% to 20% area. So what you're going to see this particular quarter is something similar. It's going to be all the segments and there's nothing really anomalous there. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James &amp; Associates, Inc., Research Division Steve Smigie. Just with regard to your comments about your -- I guess, your wireless infrastructure business, you said that you expect them to be more meaningful towards the end of 2013. And I'm just wondering, is that suggesting there's going to be some softness sort of in the middle of the year? Or is there -- are there some specific programs you expect to ramp in 2013 that makes it specifically stronger? It's just your comments on Vincent T. Roche Yes, my comment on the infrastructure and comparing the second half of '12 to the second half of '13 is really in relation to the proportion of our business that is 4G, which I expect to increase and ramp during FY '13. So that was really the comment there more so than the particular order of demand patterns across the infrastructure market in general. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis of Caris &amp; Company. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Jerry, I just wanted to take a step back and look a little bit longer term. As you look out over the course of 2013 calendar and you think about the underlying dynamics in ADI's different businesses, industrial communications, auto, et cetera, and the products that you have and the programs that you're involved in, where do you feel most confident that ADI can drive year-on-year growth in the coming year? Jerald G. Fishman Well, that's a real challenging question, given where we are and where we're coming from. So I think in each of the areas, in each of the market segments that are now strategically important to us, industrial and automotive and communications and even parts of the consumer market where we could add real value, I mean we're expecting that each of those is going to get better through the year. We'll see how it goes. We're starting off at a very low level, but I think in the long term, there are certain market segments, as I mentioned, that we're committed to strategically that we think we can change the user experience, get paid for what we do. Customers value us. I think those are the segments we're investing in. Ones that we've come to a conclusion, don't meet those criteria, we don't invest. I think we've shown that over the years and I think each year we go back and reassess what's the good, what's the bad, what's the ugly and we made changes in the portfolio mix each year, and sometimes more frequently. So it's very hard sitting where we're sitting today to say which of the segments are going to drive growth. I mean each of the segments has great opportunities. The real question is how does the market unfold during the year? Mostly on the economics side rather than on what product we have side. I think we're very confident about the product portfolio we have and the relations we have with our customers. For that part, we're consistently and increasingly confident about it. Just you just can't predict what's going to happen with aggregate business levels and sentiment out there, and that's the confusing thing out there. In the absence of that, we'd be very aggressive about what we could achieve in 2013. Craig A. Ellis - Caris &amp; Company, Inc., Research Division Okay. And then the follow-up for Dave. Dave, channel inventories are at below normal levels. As you think about where you'd like to manage them in a more normalized environment, how should we think about where inventories would likely normalize as we move through the year next year? David A. Zinsner Well, the inventories that I mentioned are down kind of close to 7 weeks, which is definitely below our target levels. I think we'd like to see them be more in the range of 7.5 to 8 weeks. And, I think, probably, we'll be at the lower end of that, certainly, in the early part of the year. But as we kind of push forward through the year, I would expect us to normalize back to that level. Ali Husain So we are -- we still have a few callers here. So we'll keep going. Operator, can we have the next caller please? Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steven Eliscu of UBS. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division First of all on automotive, you -- if we look back at calendar 2011, you were growing in excess of 20% year-on-year. That settled down and now it looks to go negative. Should we think of a rebound as we go through the coming fiscal year back to the 20%-plus type growth rate? Or was there something unique in terms of an inventory build or a set of end products that aren't necessarily selling as well going forward? Vincent T. Roche Well, the automotive business has grown very fast in the company over the past 5 years. In the last 3 years, the compounded growth rate is somewhere in the region of 14% or 15%. And automotive is now a much bigger portion of ADI's revenue. It's a bigger number. But I would say the way to look at this thing is that the growth impact is more about the market and declining or muted car sales more so than the adoption of the technology. If anything, I would say the rate of designing of our products across the 3 areas of safety, powertrain and infotainment, is stronger than ever. We're penetrating in regions, our customers in Asia, now that we have not been so successful as in the past in a completely different way now, which bodes very well for the future. So my sense is it's more really about the market demand at the consumer level rather than demand for ADI products. Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, in the base station market, you talked about a 20% to 30% content increase as we go to LTE. I'm trying to understand, is that a onetime increase in content, because it is showing in your growth rate? Or is there something more long-term secular increase in content as we go to LTE advanced and small cells as we look out to the middle of the decade? Vincent T. Roche Yes, between all of the evolution from generation to generation from 2G, to 3G, to 4G, we've typically seen a 20% to 40% increase in the value of the products we sell into those applications, partly because the complexity or sophistication of the products we're providing is greater. The performance increases from generation to generation. And also, we've been expanding our footprints in the -- in all these radio applications. So for example, we're providing a lot more radio frequency technology than we did say 5 or 6 years ago. We're beginning to meaningfully deploy clocking technology as well for timing generation and control. In areas like cable and optical infrastructure, we've a tremendous market share and growing in observation and control circuits. So I think it's really -- it's a function of the complexity of the products commanding a better ASP and also ADI expanding our bond footprint in each of the applications. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster of Macquarie. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Dave, on the change in the tax structure, does that have any impact on your operating cash flow that's generated domestically? And can you remind us what that is? David A. Zinsner It does not have any impact on our cash flow for domestic cash flow. It's a -- runs -- it can vary depending on the quarter. But it's probably -- on a rough order, probably about 1/3 of the total cash flow is generated in the U.S. Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research Okay. And then on the military part of the business, can you remind us how much of that is -- it is as a percent of sales and what your outlook is for there? David A. Zinsner It's marginal; it's in the mid-single digits. Vincent T. Roche Yes, it's about -- it's roughly about 6% to 7% of the company's revenue depending on when you measure. And it's been relatively steady over the past year. Ali Husain Great. So that concludes our Q&amp;A session. A couple of folks that we will get to after the call. We appreciate your participation and look forward to talking with all of you again during our first quarter 2013 earnings call scheduled for February 19, 2013, beginning at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.

"title": "Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices: Short The Decoupling - Seeking Alpha", 
"source": "Seeking Alpha", 
"content": "   Investors in Analog Devices  have enjoyed an 11% year-to-date return. This return coupled with a 2.95% dividend yield has left almost all holders of the stock delighted to have owned shares. Even though the company has done very well this year, I believe that investors should consider selling shares. Through this analysis, I will present the bearish case for Analog Devices and explain why I believe that we may see a price decline in the near future.A History of ReturnsIn order to objectively analyze ADI from a fundamental standpoint, I have relied heavily on return on assets and return on equity. Return on assets is the net income of the firm divided by average total assets. Return on assets is very important to monitor in that through return on assets, an analyst can understand how efficiently the company uses its operational property to generate profits for the firm. Return on equity is the net income of the firm divided by directly-invested shareholder equity and this key metric tells the researcher how well management uses investments to generate profits for the firm. In the chart below, 5 years of return on assets and return on equity can be seen for ADI.Over the past 5 years, it can be seen that ADI has had a volatile history of returns. Beginning in 2008, ADI experienced a fundamental gain in performance in which return on assets and return on equity increased until the fourth quarter of that year. This increase in performance was associated with an 18% gain in stock price. Immediately after this period, the firm entered a stage of decline, much like most companies of this time, and performance fell from the fourth quarter of 2008 until the fourth quarter of 2009. During this period, the share price experienced a likewise decrease of around 15%. In the fourth quarter of 2009, ADI began a period of strong performance in which it increased return on assets and return on equity until the middle of 2011. This period of increased performance was coupled with a gain of around 25% in the stock price. Since the middle of 2011, the fundamental returns of the organization have declined. During the past year and a half, the stock price has risen around 15%. The chart below shows a summary of these time periods.From the table above, a simple relationship can be extrapolated. As a firm increases its fundamental performance, it tends to experience an increase in stock price. This makes intuitive sense in that as a firm betters itself, the market tends to reward it by allocating greater quantities of capital to the security. Investors seek to park capital with firms that deliver performance and withdraw capital from firms in decline. This relationship has been true over the past 5 years - until now. Over the past year, the firm has experienced a significant pullback in performance in that returns on assets and return on equity have both declined by several percentage points. If history and intuition is to be a rough guide to the future, then ADI should experience share price declines in the near future. ADI is experiencing moderate and declining firm-level performance and I believe that share price will eventually \"wake-up\" to this fact and decline in the future. In light of the deteriorating fundamentals of this organization, as measured by return on assets and return on equity, I recommend shorting the security in the near future.Technically SpeakingEven though I believe that the odds currently favor shorting ADI, I do not believe that investors should immediately short the security. I believe that through patience, investors can best time their investment. ADI has been in a moderately-strong uptrend for the past year and I believe that investors should wait until the trend breaks down prior to initiating a short. As seen in the chart below, I believe that an appropriate participation level is $37.50. If price is able to close below $37.50 on a weekly-basis, then I believe investors should consider shorting ADI. I believe that investors should immediately seek to protect capital by placing a stop-loss at $42.00 per share. If price exceeds this level, then a new yearly-high will have been made and a short position will be inappropriate. If price is able to decline as this thesis predicts, then I believe investors should consider exiting one-half of their short position at $30.50. Not only is $30.50 where the current fundamental decoupling began, but it is also a location of significant technical support. For the remaining position, I believe that investors should consider exiting all shares at $26.50. This level has been a historic support point for the past 5 years and I believe price will stall here and reverse course in the future.The table below shows a breakdown of the trade recommendation. It can be seen that investors stand to gain $2.00 for every $1.00 they are willing to risk. Probabilistically speaking, this analysis needs a 50% chance of being correct for investors to consider shorting ADI using this suggested systematic approach. I believe that it has fundamentally been seen that price should be declining right now due to a deterioration of firm-level performance. If investors agree with this synopsis, then they should consider shorting ADI in the near future.

"content": "   Executives David A. Zinsner - Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Finance   Analog Devices Inc.  Morgan Stanley Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference February 26, 2013 4:20 PM ETUnknown Analyst All right. Just a quick note on disclosure. First, our disclosure. Please note that all important disclosures, including personal holdings disclosures and Morgan Stanley disclosures appear on the Morgan Stanley website at www.morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. So with that out of the way, I'm very pleased to announce from Analog Devices, CFO, Dave Zinsner; and Head of IR, Ali Husain. Thanks, guys, for coming. David A. Zinsner Sure, thanks.   Question-and-Answer Session Unknown Analyst So it seems like you guys just reported, it was a January quarter, it seems like you've seen the same patterns in other analog companies. Bookings were weak in the October, November time frame and have since gotten better. Can you talk about how you see that? Where do you think we are in the potential for a semiconductor pickup based on inventories? David A. Zinsner Yes. So as you mentioned, we had I'd say weaker orders in November, when we looked back on it. December was clearly weaker particularly because of the shutdowns that occurred at the end of December. And then for the first week of January, again, it was -- it started off kind of weak. But then as the month wore on in January, I'd say things just continually improved. Orders continually got stronger. We kind of went through the lunar new year with a little bit of weakness in Asia, but that picked -- bounced right back and things have been very strong. Our guidance is somewhat reflective of the fact that we do think that, at least as we see it, the kind of cyclical downturn that occurred looks like we kind of hit bottom and have recovered off the bottom. And now it's just a question of whether that's sustainable or not. Unknown Analyst Yes. I guess the thing that's puzzled me, and I've gotten this a little bit wrong as we've gotten through the last few quarters, but I felt like this time last year, when there was a pickup, you had just seen a strong inventory reduction from a bunch of your customers. It was very clear that you had the potential for kind of a catch-up base, as you caught up to consumption. I felt like we actually had that, but demand was weak and so that didn't look as exciting as we thought it would earlier in the year. And then now, if I look back at the last couple of quarters, I mean, I felt we entered that period with customer inventories being very lean after several quarters of reduction. So did they get even leaner? Or was it actual demand that fell off? Or just how do you see -- how did that industrial trend get so soft and kind of come back so quickly? David A. Zinsner Well, I think it was a combination of, I think, demand got a little weaker, and I think they did try to lean out inventories a little bit further. If you look at kind of the way last year kind of progressed, we kind of had a kind of a correction in the first quarter. It seemed to recover in the second quarter. But I think as we -- as you got into the back half of the year, confidence levels of our customers, which is kind of collectively all the major manufacturers worldwide, I think it got worse. People were worried about what was going on in the U.S. around the fiscal policy. People were worried about Europe because of the issues around southern countries within Europe. There was kind of political change over in China, and a lot of things kind of got halted because of that. So there was just uncertainty across the board in almost every geography. And as a result, most of our customers just kind of cranked their inventories down and slowed down programs and slowed down projects. And if there were build-outs that were going to occur via capital spend, those things got pushed out. And when all those things happened, that ends up being kind of a bit more impactful when you're way at the far end of the supply chain. And so as a result, we saw our business kind of fall off. We had some things that kind of went in our favor in the back half of the year, that kind of kept things a little bit going. But when we kind of struck into the first quarter, it certainly rolled off. And then I think that's the question now for this year is we're back to this kind of situation. We had a first quarter correction, things are recovering. We think we'll have a good second quarter. And it's -- the big question is will we now get the kind of confidence that I think is necessary to really have a decent improvement in the business? Unknown Analyst And as to the first statement that you think you're shipping to end demand right now, I know it's hard to be certain. David A. Zinsner I think it's difficult to determine at the moment. I clearly think that we weren't in the first [indiscernible]. And in the industrial side, we weren't in the fourth quarter. It does feel like if industrial is up kind of meaningfully this quarter, really the principal driver of the recovery for us sequentially, you would think that we're starting to get back to a level that's closer to equilibrium. There could be customers that are working inventories down further. But I think in general, most people are kind of now at a level of, okay, we're going to kind of keep the status quo, see how things are going. And if the business recovers, end demand starts to recover, we'll start to bring back inventory levels and demand. Unknown Analyst Okay. And then how do you think about your own inventory levels with regards to that? And the distribution channel where you took down dollars in inventory distribution, the days went up a little. And it seems like if I'm an end customer, there's enough inventory in front of me that I can kind of wait for demand, which is -- could be good news because if the demand comes through, then you'll see a strong third month to the quarter which [indiscernible] David A. Zinsner Yes, and I think that's kind of reflective -- our lead times are 4 weeks. It's certainly reflected in there. Our inventory is kind of north of 120 days. That was actually -- I think we're at similar levels last year at that time, too. The difference for us this time around is we cranked utilization up more significantly last year and built inventory with the expectation that we were coming off of what we thought was the bottom and we're going to have a pretty strong recovery. This time around, I think we'll be a little bit more conservative about it. We're going to tick up utilization but it's going to be very small, probably from kind of mid-50s to the high 50s. That's going to have the effect of bringing inventories on our balance sheet in absolute dollar terms down. And of course, given that business can be up, it's going to be a meaningful drop in the days of inventory. So that's a little bit of a different tact than we took last time. Inventories distribution is, if you look at it kind of on a look-back basis in terms of weeks of inventory, it's up to 8 weeks of inventory. But in absolute dollars, we haven't been this low, I think, I don't know, like several years, right? So this is a very lean environment for us from a distributor perspective. And based on the order flow that we're seeing from distributors and kind of our strategy around having enough inventory to meet demand, I'm going to expect that we're going to start to see a little bit of a creep-up in the absolute dollars of inventory this quarter. It might actually be down in terms of days in inventory. But certainly, in absolute dollars, we think it will be up in the second quarter. But as you said, I think we're in a pretty good position to meet demand regardless of what that demand looks like at 120 days of inventory or plus. But not so significant that if business does start to recover we start to see some amendment in the business. We won't be constrained in terms of our opportunities, you could start to see some real leverage in the P&amp;L. We're -- our gross margins will go up this quarter, but not significantly. If we do start to see a pretty meaningful ramp in demand, we start to crank utilization. We'll start to see some really good leverage on the gross margin side. Unknown Analyst Yes, I mean, I was quite impressed by where margins have been, actually, given where utilizations are. So you mentioned -- a couple of minutes ago, you mentioned that the bookings pattern was good, there's a little bit of weakness around the lunar new year. But in general, I mean, the bottom line is kind of month-by-month things keep picking up consistently with that view that this -- it feels like a bottoming process [indiscernible]. David A. Zinsner Correct. Unknown Analyst Perfect. And then your Industrial business at 45% of revenues was down about 12% last year. And that's certainly a lot more than I thought it would be down. And I had a pretty conservative macro view on what the year would look like, but I felt like your medical devices group would sort of insulate that and energy and some of the other -- there's -- everything is a little bit cyclical, but I felt like different cycles are hit at different times, and it seemed like it all kind of uniformly came down, and do you think can it all uniformly go back up? David A. Zinsner I think you probably can expect that actually. And usually, it does. I'm kind of with you, I actually didn't think it would drop to the level that it ended up dropping. But I do think it was clearly kind of inventory management at our customers and some pushouts in terms of capital spend. This business is 60,000 customers. It's very distributed. Most customers don't buy a significant amount of volume on an individual basis. They might buy 10,000 units. Most of the products are older, and the customers have been very loyal to not only the brand of ADI but that specific part and what it does in their given applications. So it's not like we're seeing share shifts. The ASPs are very stable in that business. In some cases, they actually go up. So there's no dynamic or no nefarious dynamic going on there. It clearly is about how inventory levels have moved around based on customers' feelings about the world. And I do think at this point now, given that it is down so significantly, our end customers are not down so significantly, that it comes back to normalized levels. And if we can start to see some capital spend go on in the world, it should have a pretty good recovery. Unknown Analyst Well it's definitely what our investors want exposure to right now, I think. And I guess one of the pushbacks I got when I -- in terms of why medical was weak, it had a lot of -- it's the same infrastructure mindset in China, in particular, that sort of had driven all those businesses. You had factories and hospitals and infrastructure just getting built and it all came to stop in one set [ph]. Is it possible to isolate out the impact of China from all this? I know your -- the business you ship in to China actually grew, but other devices that shipped in other regions into China. David A. Zinsner Yes, that's a difficulty we have because we sell to most of the larger industrial companies around the world. They end up shipping, I think, a fair amount of their product into China. It's hard for us to really track what goes into China versus what goes into other locations. But certainly, China is impactful to that business directly but also indirectly to our customers in other parts of the world. Unknown Analyst Okay, great. And then moving over to the communications business, it's about 19% of revenues. That was weak for you actually last quarter and continues to be a little bit weak. It's actually an area where I'm pretty bullish. David A. Zinsner Good. Unknown Analyst [indiscernible] last year. But I feel like there were visible signs of customer inventory reduction in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and there's visible signs that demand can actually come back. What's your feeling now? I mean, do you get the visibility from anybody at, or is that -- you sort of hoping that that's case but don't see it yet? David A. Zinsner I mean, well, one of the reasons why we didn't quite hit the midpoint of our guidance and came in at the lower end was really because of the communications business. And we did kind of feel like we were going to have a pretty good quarter for comm, it ended up being down, which was a little bit of a surprise to us. And what our best read on it is, one, capital spending wasn't really robust last quarter for comm. And two, it did look like some of our customers did take the opportunity to clean up their balance sheet for the end of December, and that had kind of a secondary effect on that business. As we kind of -- and we have to be cautious about how we read these things because I think our customers generally are almost as confused as we are sometimes about when the capital spend is going to come and when we're going to start to see a pickup in the business. But the read that we get from our customers, which are the base station manufacturers and the comm -- the wireline comm guys, is that things will start to recover in the back half of our fiscal year, which is our kind of third and fourth fiscal quarter. And it's likely to be up a little bit this coming quarter, but we really won't see that, the lift, until the back half of the year. And there's a lot of kind of anecdotal discussions that some of the carriers in the U.S. are talking about in terms of their capital spending, what we're hearing from China in terms of their approach to the next build-out of their infrastructure. And all that stuff is supposed to kind of intersect in the back half of the year. So we'll have to see how it goes. We certainly are going to be cautious about what we do both in terms of managing our inventory levels and our OpEx and not assume that's going to come. But we're cautiously optimistic that that's what's going to happen in the back half of the year. Unknown Analyst I mean, is it a fair assessment that that's how all of us have sort of felt for the last 12 months? Is it always 1 quarter or 2 away or... David A. Zinsner Yes, I would say, and I think everybody can... Unknown Analyst [indiscernible] David A. Zinsner Yes, yes. But I would say that the networks are absolutely creaking right now. And the carriers have done a lot to kind of milk the network as much as they can to make the network work. That hasn't always been successful. There's been a couple of times where that hasn't worked out in certain carriers' cases. And in general, the data speeds are pretty bad. So we do expect that over time, they're going to have to spend money to improve the network so that we can all kind of work on our iPhones and what have you. The other thing that I think will happen that's starting in kind of the early stages at this point, but I think will ramp over time, is this kind of move towards kind of smaller form factors with less power like small cells and those kind of things. And for ADI, we're a little bit more focused in our successes is more dictated on how many radios get sold versus how many systems get installed. So as things kind of migrate to some architecture that includes small cell, that should have the effect of significantly increasing the radio count of what gets sold per year. For us, we're almost agnostic to whether it's kind of small cell or large cell based on dollar content. So if the unit volume growth is significant, that could be very significant for us in terms of a tailwind to the business. Unknown Analyst Okay, that's great. I think that's an area of concern for a lot of people in other comm-centric mediums that have faced these exposures. Within autos, so autos is almost reverse of everything else because it's been great for the last couple of years and a little bit weak the last quarter or 2. What's your perception of that weakness? Is that just the disruption that we saw in the supply chain last quarter and is it going to be short term? David A. Zinsner Yes, I think a little bit. I mean, we had some kind of mix going on where some programs were rolling off, others were delayed in terms of when they rolled on. And I think that also was a little bit of a headwind to the automotive business. This quarter, we're suspecting it to have a pretty nice sequential improvement. I think the underlying kind of macro drivers to auto that we're really making a go for -- I think in 2007, our business was $225 million or so. And I don't know this year what we'll do but let's say it's in the $450 million to $500 million range. This business has grown significantly over the last few years. And the drivers are, I think, everyone knows about it, but dollar content, electrification of the car has been pretty significant, a lot of technology going into safety systems, both passive and active safety systems, a lot of semiconductors going into infotainment. And now as the car becomes maybe more fuel-efficient, more power-efficient be it on a hybrid or electric vehicle or has some other spec technology like start-stop kind of technology, that requires a lot of semiconductor and a lot of analog content to make those products or those applications work properly. And we just kind of continue to see an opportunity to have increasing dollar content in the vehicles in the next several years. And regardless of whether the unit volumes are up or down, I think that, that is going to fundamentally trump the unit volume and should really provide a lot of tailwinds to that business. Unknown Analyst I feel like, as you mentioned, the investors are starting to look for that theme growing dollar content. So it's actually kind of interesting if you look at the various semiconductor vendors with auto exposure. It's actually pretty clear that you and Linear Tech are doing something different than other people because your growth rate has been a lot higher, both companies. Is that just a function, you think, of focusing design count on that market a little bit more than you did 5, 10 years ago? Or is there some function in being in the right place? David A. Zinsner What we've been doing over time is trying to create a more balanced approach towards the business where we have this kind of long tail horizontal market merely sold through distribution. And we kind of continued to focus resources at that marketplace. But we have shifted some of our resources towards being more application-focused to focus on application-specific products as well. And one of the earlier initiatives into the application-specific area was in the auto space. And that kind of predates even when I started, so I don't recall, 2007 I think, they really started to have an active focus, really understand the ecosystem on the automotive space, the whole system, what areas we thought we could be successful in, what technologies that the automakers or the module makers may not even appreciate may be necessary to drive the next generation of applications within automotive. And we focused in that area and we put development efforts in that area and we talked to the customers. And over time, I think we built up a really solid business. Now I don't know what every other competitor out there has done in that space, they may or may not have done that, but that's been our approach and it's turned out to be, I think, fairly successful. Unknown Analyst That's great. And your assessment of the inventories that are carried at the automotive guys is that they are pretty lean and then... David A. Zinsner Yes, I mean, well, they generally carry their inventories pretty lean. A lot of them operate in kind of what they call VMI or vendor management inventory approach, so they literally just pull when they need product. And so they are not really in a position whether they build a lot of inventory of our parts. So we see a lot less -- it's a lot less cynical in terms of inventory cycles, and it's more a function of just more programmatically, when thing -- when programs roll off or roll on, that has a bigger driver towards whether it will be successful or not. Unknown Analyst Okay, great. Well, I'll just -- I'll finish my trip through the revenue stream and then we'll open up to the audience. But with consumer, you had alluded to some product cycles in the back half of the year. We did see those, but the business is still down year-on-year. Can you talk about what the issues are there, and if you'll see those product cycles recur kind of in the back half of this year? David A. Zinsner So the consumer space is one of these areas where we to -- we, as a company, have to be selective given the DNA of -- our devices have to be more on the kind of technology forefront. We tend not to be the lowest cost producer and we tend to lead with technology. And then on the consumer space, given that the cycles are fast and costs can sometimes be the more dominant driver or determiner which vendor a customer chooses, we tend to be in sometimes and out sometimes. And I think in some cases in the last few years, we've been out more than we've been in. We put someone new into that business, I don't know, maybe about 1.5 years or 2 years ago. He's been kind of doing the same approach we really -- we did in the auto space years before, but really focusing on what technologies we have, where we can differentiate, where we have, what we think are proprietary capabilities in that space and really focusing our resources on that. And there is a little bit of a time lag in terms of taking all that effort and really creating a business and then really seeing kind of the fruits of that. And in the meantime, there's a little bit of dribbling out of the old stuff that we got years ago that we haven't reinvested in. So I think that's really what's going on. We'll continue to be selective. But I have a feeling over time we're going to start to see more momentum in that business than we've seen in the past. It may not be this year, but I certainly think over the next few years, we'll find opportunities to be successful in that space with -- in areas where technology will really matter. And we are already starting to see that. And I think that's one of the things that helped out in the back half of 2012. I expect that we'll probably see something similar to that in 2013, and then we'll just kind of see how it goes. Unknown Analyst Okay. Great. Let me see if there's any questions from the audience. If not, I'll keep going. Unknown Analyst Most semiconductor companies are reporting very low levels of channel inventory. So I'm interested in your thoughts as to whether you think that's a new normal, so structurally lower or whether it's just a reflection of where we are in the cycle? David A. Zinsner Yes. I kind of feel like the inventory levels at distribution are highly dependent on kind of in-demand and lead times. And as soon as lead times stretch out a little bit and end demand gets robust, they suddenly throw out the old model and bring in a new model, which is carry higher levels of inventory to make sure they aren't caught short. And I suspect that will happen when that happens. It just so happens that over the last 18 months or so, there hasn't been a big stimulus to the end demand side of things and lead times have been relatively short, so they haven't had to panic that much about where they're going to get their products. But mark my word, as soon as there is one little slip and one little part stretches out in terms of lead time, they'll suddenly have a new whole new approach to inventory levels and they'll bring them up. Unknown Analyst What would you want distribution inventory to be, if it were under your control? I mean, you have this inventory that never really declines in value. You can only lose business if you don't have the product to support it. So I mean, why not carry a high level of inventory? David A. Zinsner At distribution? Unknown Analyst At distribution and on your own balance sheet, why not? David A. Zinsner Yes, and I think that is the approach we take. I mean, we generally carry 100 -- I mean, our goal is really to carry 110 days, 100 to 110 days of inventory. I think if you look at us relative to most of the competitors, that's a little high. And we do that because we try to keep the lead times short. One of the things we think we differentiate ourselves on is we don't run into -- we try not to run into situations where we drive our lead times out 12 weeks and we let the -- we give customers confidence that we're going to be able to provide the part when and if they're going to need it. Unknown Analyst And in the distribution side, you don't recognize it as revenue anyway, [indiscernible] why not? David A. Zinsner And we take little risk on it because most of the parts are very long life cycle parts, and so it's not like we have obsolescence risk that some customers -- or competitors that are more focused in the consumer space where cycles are faster. They obviously take more risk to do that. And that is our approach. Now I think that the goal would be to have about 8 weeks of inventory at distribution by virtue of the fact that business is down, they are at 8 weeks. When business recovers next quarter, they're likely not to be 8 weeks. But I think over time, we would rather see them at 8. We'd like to be kind of in that 110 days or maybe slightly lower than that. I wouldn't want to get too low because you do run the risk of stretching out lead times. And once lead times stretch out, not only do you have serious issues with just relationships with customers which can be problematic, but you completely lose visibility as to what's going on because then you start to have double ordering and people hoarding and then that... Unknown Analyst Of course, that's what we all want. David A. Zinsner Yes, you guys want that but I don't want that. Unknown Analyst Understood. Any other questions from the audience? You had alluded to gross margins and you put up a pretty good gross margin number for the utilization that you had at 64%, with mid-50s type of utilization. Do you think that signals that you can get to new highs in gross margin? And I know you've done a lot of things, you personally and the company have done a lot of things to improve gross margin. Are there still, I know there's smaller things now, but are there still things you can do to kind of keep moving up through the cycle gross margin? David A. Zinsner Yes, I think so. I mean, clearly, we're happy that our gross margins at kind of lower utilizations has been -- we typically run -- I think, I can't remember the last time we were in the 50s, but I think it was in 2009, if I'm not correct -- if I'm not mistaken. So it's -- I think, just to know that we're now -- our low point is higher than the high points that we used to have in prior years I think is a pretty significant accomplishment. We are doing a lot of little things now to improve the gross margins further. I don't think there are big structural changes that need to happen in terms of closing fabs or what-have-you that would move our margins up significantly. But there are a lot of things that we can do that are subtle around pricing and around cost that I think can help improve the gross margin for the next cycle. But first, what I want to do is get a recovery going and start to see our -- the company improve back to the levels that we were operating in, in kind of 2011, early part of 2012. And when that happens, then we're -- then I think we'll be ready to talk about numbers that are higher than that. Unknown Analyst Yes, fair enough. And to the extent that if industrial does lead the way out and is stronger, that obviously helps gross margin? David A. Zinsner Absolutely, it's unofficial. Industrial, on a cost basis, have much better margins. But on a -- on top of that, most of that, the internal manufacturing is in industrial businesses. And so if industrial recovers, we get huge fall-through and huge absorption benefit based on the internal manufacturing model. Unknown Analyst Okay, great. And my last question is going to be on cash. You guys have a lot of it. I don't think the market is giving you full credit for it. You had the highest dividend yield and now TI is obviously taking a much bigger stance in terms of returning 100% of the cash flow to shareholders. Where do you guys stand now in terms of thinking about dividends versus buybacks versus other uses of cash? David A. Zinsner So you may have noticed that we increased our dividend last quarter by, I think, it was 13%, right? So we continue to be very committed on the dividend. I think historically we had been paying out about 40% of our earnings in dividends. We've been kind of trying to push that up. I think if you look over the next few quarters, it's probably going to be like 60%, it's what it's going to end up being of our free cash flow. It's going to be out in dividend. So we have definitely tried to be, tried to lead, I guess, with dividends to improve shareholder returns. We still have a buyback program, we're still committed to the buyback program. I would say one of -- maybe the one difference we have now than we've had perhaps in periods beforehand was that we do have kind of a -- we do look at the price of the stock relative to kind of historical averages. And when the stock falls below those historical averages, that's when we tend to take an opportunity to buy the stock versus the old model, which I think a lot of other companies employed as well, which is you ended up buying when times were good because you felt the world was better, and that ended up being the high price for buying the stock right back. We try to take it and hopefully take advantage of the volatility in the stock and buybacks on the lows. But I think you'll see over time we'll be very good purchasers of our stock. Then the rest of it, the cash, which I don't think we'll have a significant need for, but there is some M&amp;A that we do from time to time. It tends to be more tuck-in oriented. And but those -- the price tags on those can be at varying levels, so we'll hopefully take some opportunity, some of the cash in a place where we think we can get a really good ROI on it for technology that it would make more sense to buy it than build it internally. And those are the kind of 3 uses. Unknown Analyst And for the filings you have, over $3 a share of that cash that is actually in the U.S., is not -- there's no -- is not subject to repatriation? David A. Zinsner Yes, I guess so. $10 is [indiscernible]. It's high-order math. Unknown Analyst So I mean, that's not a factor of you can return... David A. Zinsner You know what, there's no -- there's almost no limitation to the cash. I mean, we have $1.1 billion of cash on U.S., we have another $500 million revolver that's untouched that if we needed to use cash we could certainly get at it. So I think there's plenty of flexibility. The U.S. has plenty of opportunities to raise more cash if they wanted to do buybacks and stuff. That certainly isn't going to be an impediment to anything we do on that capital structure side. It's just more a function of hopefully being smart about when we do make the purchases of the stock and try to buy it at low points. Unknown Analyst Great, all right.

Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference May 23, 2013 1:10 PM ETBlayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division All right. We'll go ahead and get started. My name is Blayne Curtis. I'm the analyst here at Barclays. Very happy to have with me Analog Devices. From the company, Dave Zinsner, VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer; as well as, Ali Husain, who many of you know from Investor Relations.   Question-and-Answer Session Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division So just to jump right in things, I mean, you just reported earnings 2 days ago, so maybe, Dave, it will be helpful to just kind of recap that a bit. The April quarter was essentially in line. The guidance was a bit muted, still seeing Analog growth. The rest of it, it is fairly flat. So maybe that would be a good entry. I think most of them know your business but maybe just step through kind of, just what do you think from the end market in the near-term here? David A. Zinsner Yes, okay. So last term -- wish I don't hit this mic. Last quarter was a pretty good quarter. It came in pretty much as expected. We thought we'd be somewhere between kind of 4% and 8% off then we finished kind of rate. We split the goal close and came in 6% up. Good strength in the industrial space, which is usually what happens in our second quarter, and good -- I think good progress on gross margins. We improved gross margins, improved operating margins back into the 30% range. So everything looked pretty good. We also did take inventory down, which if you go back to last year this time, there was kind of similar trajectory. One thing we did was we built inventory last year. This time -- this year, we decided to actually keep inventory relatively lean and as things pick up, we'll get the leverage when that happens. This quarter, I would say bookings in general, over the quarter, were very solid. But certainly, strengthened through the quarter and exited the quarter with very strong bookings. They were -- both our bookings as we measure it on us, which is basically our OEMs plus what the distributors order. And the orders, if you combine OEM and what the -- and customers order on distributors of our parts, both of those were up double digits. So that -- those are all good positive signs indicating some momentum. So as we kind of thought about our guidance, we thought given all those things and particularly we saw strength in industrial, we felt like there's a reasonable opportunity yet towards the higher end of the range we gave, which was kind of, we gave essentially flat to up 4%. So we thought that, that's as a reasonable scenario, which would indicate we'd be kind of closer to the top in the range. I think as we thought about the bottom end of the range, what kind of entered our mind was last year. Everything felt almost exactly the same last year and we worked hard a bit off-guard as things really started to slow down particularly in July. And we certainly get industrial data points but the thing that we really hang our guidance on is really bookings and how bookings are transpiring. And the difficulty we have is, we have very short lead times and so right now, customers are booking mainly for deliveries in June not into July. In July, it becomes this kind of like unknown entity out there that where we're not really sure how things are going to go. So we thought well if a scenario transpire, which is momentum continues and at some point in anticipation of summer shutdowns or what have you, July really weakens. We ought to have that as that be our kind of our downside scenario and that's what kind of led us into this kind of flattish on the downside. At this point, there's not any evidence to suggest that, that's going to happen but out of abundance precaution more than anything, that was why we gave that kind of range. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division It is a clearly the data if you look at your guidance up almost 2%. And if you look back historical trends, it does seem more seasonal than not, or more normal than not, and I guess when you look at the remainder of the year, seasonality industrial is weaker in Q4 and better in the first half. The big debate is this year, normal or is this the new level or are we seeing something different this year? And I mean, do you have any indications that other end markets, and I think that most of you will get to networking but I think if you're hopeful. What will make this different than last? David A. Zinsner Well I think if you guide -- under our guide where the midpoint is kind of up 2%, that I think you're right. That is kind of normal seasonality although quite honestly, that's an average of 5 years of things going really gangbusters or not or going into the toilet. So there's been only I think one year where we actually did do up 2%. I think that was last year. So I think on the industrial side, we -- assuming that the macro doesn't fall apart on us. I think we have a pretty good deal that there's some momentum. Having said that, I wouldn't call it kind of a recovery momentum. I'd call it, our customers are being very cautious but demand is picking up modestly and so they're ordering very modestly, it's that kind of scenario for industrial. Hopefully, at some point, we get kind of a real robustness. People start spending capital for factories and buy industrial equipment and so forth. And those things really start to kind of pull the industrial business up and that would be the kind of the characteristics of a real recovery. On the comp side, as you point out, we guided flat communications and although we kind of hang out a little carried, which was orders in the last couple of weeks for comps did tick up. And I think trying to take 2 weeks and extrapolate that out and say, Okay, that things are back to the rate they probably -- we've done that many times internally and that usually ends up being a disaster. I think at this point now there's limited to no visibility as to how carriers are going to deploy equipment and what's going to happen to our OEMs and thus what's going to happen to us, in terms of deliveries and comp space. But I think that's still pretty much a wait-and-see game for us and at this point, there's no indications that it's going to do anything but be flat in the third quarter. Consumer, we thought would be flat as well but that business is generally kind of flattish in the third quarter. I also would expect, hopefully, that seasonality will play in the fourth quarter and that business starts to recover. But with that again, we don't have any orders or any firm indications that, that's going to happen but that's the going planning assumption at this point. And then on the auto space, which had a great quarter this quarter, in fact, it exceeded our expectations and was at a level now where it's pretty much as high or are we right in close to a tie? That business, we thought would be flat. Normally, it's seasonalities in auto is okay but it starts to fall off a little bit in our fiscal third quarter and then it starts to recover in the fourth quarter. Yes that one could surprise us again. It's kind of hard to tell. And there's certain -- we pull all these like little data points out. What the U.S. automakers are going to do in terms of shutdowns. Seems like they're not going to do as much shutdown activity, if any, through the summer. That could be positive. We think their inventory is in relatively good condition. We're designed, or rather our registrations are up in certain countries and in Europe. So there might be some opportunity there to start to see some growth. I think fundamentally though that business has a dollar content story that's been going on. It's been growing double digits for 5 years. So I would assume that even if the end unit volumes of autos is not that robust, there might be some bouncing around depending on the quarter but I think in general that business is going to grow quite well because of the dollar content. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division You mentioned your lead times in the fairly low and I would say and maybe you can go by, I mean when you're competing for business, I'm assuming everybody else's lead times are fairly or maybe outside of 1 or 2 companies [indiscernible] extending. Since like for the industry, most people have ample capacity and low lead times. You mentioned that you're not really ramping up the fabs and I think going out slow, are you built to fly, and you feel comfortable and is that why the inventory [indiscernible] . So can you just talk about -- is there any real catalyst for 1 year customers who are stocking to for lead times to extend? David A. Zinsner Yes. I think -- well I think, first of all, we have 115 days of inventory I think as of the last quarter. That's plenty of inventory, again, through any starting pickup and demand. By the time we start to deplete that level of inventory, we'll be in a place where we can build up. And a lot of stuff is sitting in finished goods are in a dye bank anyway and it can be moved through the finished goods in a relatively quick period. So I'd say right now, the way we're structured in almost any scenario of demand, at least for the foreseeable future, we should be okay in terms of being able to supply. I mean it will obviously, pull the factory up but we have enough cushion in between, plus we have inventory at distribution for that -- those customers. So that's another cushion for us to see pickup and demand. I think from a lead time perspective, when does that stretch out? We actually was just somewhat different than some company strategies. We actually try our best to keep that lead time constrain no matter what, to fix tweaks that kind of maxed maybe a few parts going into the 8-week range but for the most part, we try to keep lead times short. As much as possible, we'll build to make sure that we're meeting demand. One is hopefully capture some upside. But two, I think it's one of the things that differentiates us from our customers, that we're always there. We're always able to deliver. If you have a sudden [indiscernible] orders, we're going to have the parts there for you. And I think customers generally value it. Having said that, at some point, somebody will be short on some part. And when that happens and assuming it's a fairly meaningful part, then that customer begins to panic about every other part they buy from everyone else and they start to think about their inventory levels, which I think are relatively lean-and-go, maybe I do need to bring it back up, it will at least [indiscernible] Will what have averaged over a longer period of time. And the -- and maybe in some cases even order more than that. And then that starts to kind of permeate through the whole supply chain and then everybody starts to worry about it. And so that will happen, I'm sure. Every time somebody says we've got this all figured out and that's not going to happen, it happens. So we'll -- that's definitely not the situation I think most of us are in at this point but at some point, it's likely to happen. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division It's just maybe a refresher when you look back to last year, in the July volume falling off, you just said you had visibility into June now, what were the timing of when you saw that fall off, was it literally none for July and then by segment was there any sort of or geography any sort of we've particular weakness that may or may not repeat? David A. Zinsner Yes, well I think it was mainly in what the most noticeable thing that happened was in the industrial space. It was in the kind of U.S. and European markets for the most part, which is where most of that revenue finds its way to. Now ultimately, their end application might now go into Asia, but, who we're selling to or who we're designing with is generally in the U.S. and Europe. It's one -- the difficult thing about the business like ADI is that runs somewhat on trends and it's difficult to know whether you're in a trend until you have like 12 weeks of data and you go, \"Oh my gosh, yes, of course, we were down\". When you're sitting in the middle of it, you go, \"Oh, maybe this was an off week. And maybe they're was a vacation in Indonesia that caused this to happen. And so we have a difficulty figuring out exactly what hard details as to whether we're in the midst of something different or not. But when you look back on that period, that whole thing with sequestration and on top of the issues around Europe, I think it's just -- it turned a switch off for almost any CEO of an industrial Company to go, \"You know what, we're going to defer capital spending, I'm just very unsure about the world. And we'll come back next year and hope that the world is still alive and we'll worry about capital spending then\". And that then permeates back through, through to us and we start to see inventories start to come down and demands start to follow. And that's really what happens. And it's anybody's guess whether that happens again. At this point there's no clear indication that, that is happening. But that's why we've operate cautiously through the summer and just not take risk with our manufacturing strategy, with our operating expenses or what have you and we just carefully manage through this and when we do see a really sustained kind of level of recovery, we'll start to think about what we do in those areas. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Excellent. Maybe the auto business was trying across board for every company in Q1 and most are seeing some moderation in Q2. Obviously, a low point in Q4 so I think some of it was supply chain rebalancing included the end markets data point and it's actually fairly decent scenarios. But just curious on what you think is going around the supply chain and by being flat in Q2 is that kind of now were caught up and if the auto market continues to do well then you can drop that base or.. David A. Zinsner So we're talking calendar Q2, right? Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Sorry, yes, calendar for April. David A. Zinsner Yes, yes. So the -- yes, I think for autos, I think this period is actually -- it's hard to notice seasonality in autos right now because I thought there's been a lot of dollar content gains and also all these stuff around the cycles has really masked what is typically this quarter coming up is actually kind of a seasonally weaker quarter for autos. But I don't think there's anything systemic going on there. Did they build a little more inventory last quarter, they may have, but I'd say if they did it was relatively modest. I just think this is like a seasonal pause that you normally have and then the next quarter you start to have a new platform of course, coming out and at that point, it starts to ramp back again. I still think there is absolutely a dollar content story going on for anybody that serves the auto space. So much electronics are going in to make the systems within a car safer, to make them more energy efficient, to provide more information to the driver and what have you. And that trend, which started probably at the high-end and works its way down to the more mainstream cars is still going on. I think it's got a lot of legs to it. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division It looks like you're beaten I mean, it's [indiscernible] you're seeing a lot of impressive issues as far as reduce of pockets or pricing and autos is just the one area that actually seems -- it's going to be a good time for a while, obviously, it's attracting a lot of attention. Maybe if you could talk about where you're positioned best and what kind of growth do you see for the auto team [ph] . David A. Zinsner Well okay. So before I go into that subcategories, the one thing I would say is just suddenly waking up tomorrow and saying, \"I'm getting into the auto business\" is pretty hard to do. There are certifications that are required obviously, to supply to the automakers and they take those very seriously, the bait in auto I think is 0 to 1 parts per million that you can have in terms of failure. So your test platforms have to be pretty robust to make sure that you can deliver the quality levels that they expect and they generally, if you slip off that generally don't go back to you again. So it's a high-risk gain. So I think, although some companies might have aspirations to be in that, might be just trying to design parts into it to actually be there in volume is a whole another order and I think they're highly unlikely that somebody's going to actually enter that as they have entered already. We service 3 different subcategories within automotive: One is in Infotainment, which I talked about. This is delivering audio and video and what have you. I'd say it's the one that gets probably the most attention from everyone, because it's a kin to consumer. Parts in [indiscernible], people understand it and can see it. That's been a good business for us. It continues to be a good business. But I actually think the other 2 areas are probably have -- they probably have even more potential. One is safety systems. Safety systems at the beginning were more just figuring out ways to fire airbags but increasingly these systems are moving towards active safety systems, which actually do something to the car to make it safer in the event something's happens, antiskid, stability, control, identifying objects in the road and it's doing something with breaks so what have you moving the car in some way to make sure you're not going to hit it. Those systems are starting to permeate into the high-end of the automotive fuel space but eventually, these things are just going to be mandated across-the-board and your carmakers will need to meet safety standards and when that happens, this will be significantly pervasive through most of the automobile market. And then lastly, we serviced the powertrain market, that also gone through a transition. Powertrain was not that interesting for a while but now in an effort to make these automobiles more energy-efficient, suddenly it's got a resurgence. So this includes hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles, some of the many things that you need not to worry about in terms of the battery and something was going on. It also includes start stop battery, which I think [indiscernible] been in Europe, they know of, it's not tremendously pervasive in the U.S. market but will be. I mean this allows radio your standard combustible engines to be more energy-efficient by an order of magnitude and my guess is that, this will be mandated by most countries over the course of the next few years. And to do that kind of start stop technology, it requires a good amount of signal processing to make that happen. So we are very well-positioned. We get a lot of parts in there and I mean one of the parts we do in the safety side is a MEMs-based technology, which quite honestly not a lot of semiconductor companies can do, most of that competing technology is actually in module manufacturers like a Bosch or somebody. So we're one of the few semiconductor companies that supplies to the auto space with MEMS technology because it's just really hard to do and then meet the quality standard that the automakers really want. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division [indiscernible] into Networking, you mentioned that you give a little tease that had perked up a little bit, I think everybody's been hopeful and we've had many companies [indiscernible] that market, I think there's a big sense that it's really taking up the time but maybe he's on the look where you're seeing any particular strength and is there any -- I think there's a lot of but maybe you can talk about that in broader. David A. Zinsner So we're relatively agnostic to which carriers are going to deploy, which regions are going to deploy. Clearly, as things move from 2G to 2.5G to 3G to LTE, we -- there's been a pickup in dollar content that we've been able to garner in each kind of evolution. And so as things move from 3G, which is predominantly what we sell today, to 4G or LTE that's going to be very helpful to that business there on top of just an additional rash of deployment to improve the bandwidth. I think right now the best I can say is that the OEMs believe that it's going to happen at some point obviously. We think that just in talking into the OEMs and our own understanding network is, the other networks do need to move to higher bandwidth, higher speed systems to be able to support video and the massive amount of data rates that are going to be required to support LTE phones or 4G phones. So that in of itself is absolutely going to happen. The question has always been, when does it happen. What [indiscernible] It's been one of this that the carriers have kind of pushed off as much as they can but I think they're at the point now where they really do have to strategy kind of deploying these things. It looks like they're ramping capital spending today is more about the footprint and once that's kind of done, real estate that transitions towards the -- towards speed and bandwidth. So I think we're in the phase of footprint and we transition to bandwidth. The question is when do that happen and I don't know. And the guys that tell you they know, they have a better crystal ball than the ones that we have at ADI because the OEMs at this point although in some weeks, the orders have picked up. I don't think it's been at a sustainable level to indicate that there's significant deployment imminently going to happen and so we'll just have kind of have to wait and see. At this point now we've read the same press releases from our market analysis that everyone else reads and our hopeful and we'll just kind of wait and see. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division [indiscernible] like consumer and I give you a hard time in areas called about being selective I think for my thing obviously, there's been a lot of analog companies who have essentially the insights consumer mobile given the it doesn't fit the exact profile the rest of your business. But I guess I understand that I guess, where do you see opportunities still in consumer to really get paid for what you deliver? David A. Zinsner Well we have, in some ways, deemphasized consumer but we also I think just more sharpen our focus on the areas that we think we can participate in. We're ADI does really well is when there is some new need from the OEMs that is particularly difficult to solve technologically. And where we have the resources and some ability to solve those problems. And where we don't do well is when 17 different suppliers can do the exact same thing and just change the part number and there you go. And because we are not going to be the absolute lowest cost 20% gross margin kind of play. So we've been, what we tried to do is be careful, invest where we think we can, put the investment in, there is a benefit to being in consumer in that things that happen in the consumer space in some cases kind of move over to automotive and military and industrial. So I think we do get some cross-pollination of understanding of the technology that actually helps drive the growth rate in the other segments as well. I say that's the area that we are most focused on is the portable space. Having said that, we're not trying to be in the handset that sells 45 million units with like 7 different chips. I think what we try to do is find that 1 application, that 1 solution that maybe it goes broadly into a smartphone or maybe it goes into certain higher-end type portable application, but does something really unique and interesting that really makes a difference for their and they value and give us return. What I think Den[ph] Said in the call is no matter how well we do sometimes, the transitions happen fast and we're in and we're out. I think we always go in recognizing that, that's going to be the case. And we only put the resources in to make the ROI work for us and that's been the model. So I think we've run rate now about 15% of revenue in consumer. I'd say that's probably about what will run give or take plus or minus couple of points, which on relative basis to many of our competitors. That's actually quite low. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Dave, I wanted to ask you and as you roll the entire business I think in the last -- you just on earnings call and it's a hard question answer but if you look at your overall business, it has been down year-over-year for several quarters then there's a lot of moving pieces within that, I'm assuming that you still feel like you've been maintaining share, you've been share in some of your core markets. I don't think you're going to say the sunny market that this market has been growing. So maybe if you can walk through some of the moving pieces. David A. Zinsner Well I think in general, the semiconductor market has had good years and not so good years and we just came off a year, which the semiconductor order was not good. We're in a period of time that stretches since 2009 that like from a macroeconomic standpoint we haven't seen since 1930s. So it's if -- I think it's reasonable to expect we're going to have some volatility as people figure out the what the real level of GDP is and how much inventory they should hold and how much they can trust the suppliers to meet the demand when the demand shows up and I think we're kind of working through that process. And so 2010 was a big year, 2011 was a big year, 2012 not so good. It start now a little slow for 2013. But I think systemically, this business does grow. Once it grows, it probably grows faster than GDP, though I think it's on average over years and years and years that it grows 15%, now, probably doesn't anymore. [indiscernible] we are mid to high-single digits I think that is probably a reasonable expectation for the market. So we're in one of those periods where it depends on what upcycles, where as soon as one of these cycle starts, everybody is convinced that it's now negative. I don't think that's where we're at, and I think that, that's just a cycle and if things happen it will go the other direction and then everybody will think we're back to growing 20% a year. So -- but on average I'd say it's probably like mid-to high single-digits. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division And then one thing that you, I mean, maybe if you drove me maybe when you agree that the growth profile has matured, but I think you have seen you would agree, companies act like more mature industries as far as returning cash, you guys have raised your targets there, maybe you could talk about that and then you're committed to buying back more stock, what would be the real trigger there. I think you said be opportunistic and how you think about. David A. Zinsner Okay and so we talked about moving the -- what we have been averaging over the last few years is about 60% of our free cash flow, going back to investors but the predominant amount of that was dividends, I think going forward, we still are committed to the dividend and we still want to try to drive that dividend up over time. Having said that, to kind of move it from 60% to 80%, probably more of incrementals is going to come from buybacks. So we kind of built a model over 5 years that we thought was reasonable for us, given almost in the economic scenario that we could kind of maintain, a kind of 80% level, although having said that, which is why I talked about in the call, was some quarters is going to be less than that some quarters will be more than that and that will mainly be around buyback. The way we kind of run our buyback program is we tried to be, as you point out opportunistic or disciplined around the buybacks of the stock but that doesn't necessarily mean I have some crystal ball as to when the stock is low or when it's not, I [indiscernible] that I don't. So basically we take a pretty orderly look at this and kind of look at kind of a -- not really a long term but kind of a near-term average on a stock price. And as if that stock happens to be below that or kind of on top of that, the buybacks will kind of start to trigger if it's kind of -- for the stock has that's gone progressively running up, it won't execute during those periods of time. So we won't get below from the low per se but I think we'll get on average of price that is lower than what we're averaging. And that hopefully, buyback a little bit more stock than ordinarily. What happened under one that's more systematic that happens every quarter. But I feel fairly confident that although it may not happen in every quarter, it may not happen consistently, it will definitely average this 80%, once we look back at it over a 5-year period or even like a couple-of-year period, we'll see it average around 80%. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Either half of it, accurately, [indiscernible] more mature industry is optimizing the balance sheet and coming in the '08, '09, I think. David A. Zinsner It's like a 4 letter word. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Yes, I think it's not coming from a full circle, where people are cheering for you to add more that. You just got a deal, why not add more when you look at other industries, industrials or into staples where they care more. David A. Zinsner Right. While we're -- I'd say partly, we're easing into it a little bit. We've done, this is now our third bond deal that we've done. we just completed yesterday we got great pricing. Really, we actually locked in the treasury rate a month ago. So our real cost of this financing was somewhere in the 2.7% range for 10 years, which is unheard of. So it was a $500 million deal, we were going to redeem our bonds from -- that was going to mature in 2014 but we did add another $100 million of cash and incremental debt to the balance sheet. Yes, I think part of the strategy of getting this 80% kind of level of free cash flow return is about, incrementally adding debt. The one thing I would tell you is that -- I'm not sure, not everyone is interested in the goings-on of the rating agencies but the rating agencies tends to look at us and tend to ignore the cash balance that we have or the net cash position we have, and they kind of take this look of just the basically the cash flow and they really have us manage the debt based on how we do on this cash flow basis and so at some point as you raised that even though on a net basis is not really increasing the debt, that starts to affect your rating and then subsequently starts to affect your cost of capital. And so over time, I think we'll start to see our cash flows go up and so that will allow us to do -- -- to provide more leverage and rating agencies may relax their posture on this a little bit more over time as well, as they get comfortable with the business model. And I think ultimately, we will be a company that has leverage like the S&amp;P 500 in general has leverage to support that working capital and what have you. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division I did want to give you audience opportunity, if there's any question, so we do that now. So keep going. Here's one. Unknown Analyst Just a follow up on your balance sheet, do you have a targeted bond rating or leveraged target? David A. Zinsner Yes, so we are rating as A-, so we've targeted to maintain that A rating, A- rating. Never say never that we could take it down to BBB but we've generally committed to the bondholders that we would kind of maintain this A- rating and so we're going to do that. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division I wanted to ask about gross margins that we kind of hit in the [indiscernible] rate and doesn't seem like you're ramping up the fabs, you're hearing this amount of interim balance sheet, are there any kind of other drivers for that gross margin in the back half. And last year, you had a big consumer, driver and you expect seasonal or maybe the mix is different in [indiscernible] , what are the different factors? David A. Zinsner Well the biggest single factor for gross margins is got to be this utilization but a lot of we're deal -- the way we maintain utilization or why we maintain utilization is actually to bring inventory down. So utilization didn't start to creep up, even in kind of a not so robust improvement on the revenue side. So I think there is gross margin leverage to be had even at these kinds of level or maybe even just slightly above that. Mix, I don't think is going to be a big factor. I mean, it might be a modest factor but our gross margin's on a consumer business are actually quite good, they're not like your -- they're not your grandfather's gross margins. So I think the mix will kind of hang in there regardless of which end markets kind of moves around for the most part. We actually are consistently looking at ways to improve our cost structure for manufacturing our parts and I meet with 15 twice a quarter really to come up with something that we could do to further enhance our gross margin. So those things are progressing and I think we're making improvements there as well. So even under scenario with flattish utilization and the flattish mix, I'd still think we actually have some improvement to be had kind of modestly over the course of the next couple of years on the cost of manufacturing side. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Research Division Well thank you, David. David A. Zinsner All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Q3 2009 Earnings Call August 18, 2009 5:00 PM ET Operator At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices fiscal third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Miss Kohl, you may begin your conference. Mindy Kohl Good afternoon everyone. This is Mindy Kohl, Director of Investor Relations for Analog Devices. We really appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you have not yet seen our third quarter fiscal 2009 release, you can access it on the home page of our IR website at www.investor.analog.com.  This conference call is also being broadcast live on the Internet and the web cast may be accessed by clicking on the microphone icon on the home page of our IR website. A recording of this conference call will be available today within about two hours of the calls completion and will remain available via phone and Internet playback for one week. This web cast will also be archived on our IR website.  Participating in todays call are Jerald Fishman, President and CEO, and David Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part of the call Jerald and David will present our third quarter results and our short-term outlook and then we will open it up for questions during the latter part of the call. During todays call, we will refer to several non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for one-time items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in todays earnings release, which is now posted on the IR website. Weve also updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;Ls for continuing operations as well as historical quarterly and annual information for product revenue from continuing operations by end market and by product type.  Next, Id ask you to please note that the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which include risks and uncertainties. The companys actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing.  Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in the companys SEC filings, including our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed this afternoon.  The forward-looking information that is provided by the company in this call represents the companys outlook as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause the companys outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is August 18, 2009. With that, Ill turn the call over to Jerald Fishman. Jerald Fishman Good afternoon and thanks for joining us on todays call. As you can see from the press release and the 10-Q, we had a very solid quarter with sequential revenue growth of 4% and earnings growth of about 22%.  These results were both ahead of our plan as orders were stronger then we predicted throughout the quarter. On a sequential basis revenues grew 28% in the consumer market, 21% in the automotive market and 3% in the industrial market.  Communications revenues declined 9% sequentially as we expected as our largest wireless infrastructure customers in Asia reduced their order levels to lower their inventories. Sales to handset customers increased during the quarter in line with all these market trends, our revenues were approximately flat in the US and Europe, up in Japan, and declined slightly in Asia, mostly as a result of Chinese infrastructure revenue declines.  Orders on ADI grew significantly in Q3, the result of a generally more positive outlook at most of our customers and also our distributors restocking after many quarters of reducing their inventory.  As a result our book to bill ratio was above one for the quarter and our backlog increased. Distributor orders on ADI were higher than orders from our end customers on our distributors which is typical in this phase of the business cycle where the distributors are restocking their shelves.  Overall our sense is that customers and distributors are more confident as they believe theyve seen the low point of the cycle and theyre now planning for some growth in the future. I think most importantly orders from our industrial customers increased sequentially for the first time in many quarters.  Given the importance of the industrial market to ADI weve now surveyed our largest industrial customers to better understand their expectations for the near-term future. Generally our most optimistic industrial customers are in Asia where growth prospects are the strongest and ADI is building a very significant industrial franchise that replicates our leadership position built over many years in the industrial markets in the United States and Europe. Overall most industrial customers across all the regions including the US and Europe believe that business has stabilized and they are planning for a continued gradual recovery later this year and into 2010. During Q3 our gross margins declined by about 100 basis points to 54.1% which was in line with the expectations given the somewhat lopsided mix of business that was atypical for the quarter. At this point in the cycle we believe weve now reached the trough for gross margins.  The industrial business is now beginning to grow and our inventory levels are now back in line with our model so utilization will begin to increase in our fourth quarter. As we said last quarter we believe were at the very beginnings of a fairly significant ramp in gross margins in 2010 and beyond.  Operating margins improved to 16% of sales. We continue to see the benefits of previous restructuring actions as operating expenses declined by an additional $4 million or approximately 2% sequentially representing now a cumulative decline of more than $53 million on a quarterly basis or 22% excluding restructuring costs since the end of the prior year period.  We believe that ADI is now in a very strong position, perhaps the strongest in our recent history. During the downturn we continue to invest significantly in new product development to further improve our portfolio and our competitive position.  At the same time we reduce our costs by over 20% a portion of which are permanent cost reductions. We believe that the third quarter as I said earlier marked the low point for our gross margins in the cycle and the tangible benefits of our margin improvement initiatives are just beginning to unfold.  We are planning to tightly manage operating expenses in this cycle so that our earnings can grow much faster then our revenues. As we finalize next years operating plan later this quarter well be able to provide more specific guidance regarding our financial goals for fiscal 2010 and we hope to do that, or be ready to talk about that by next quarters call.  So now Ill turn the podium over here to David who is going to review the financials in a bit more detail.  David Zinsner  Thanks Jerald, as Jerald stated revenues were $492 million, a 4% increase from the prior quarter and a 25% decrease from the prior year. Orders increased this quarter and we closed the quarter with a book to bill that was above one.  Gross margins were 54.1% which was within our forecasted range of 54% to 55%. This was down from the 55.1% we reported in Q2 due to a greater mix of consumer and automotive revenue and less communications infrastructure revenue.  In addition factory utilization remained low at approximately 45% as we continued to focus on reducing inventory levels in the third quarter. Inventory on our balance sheet declined by $29 million this quarter and our days of inventory are now at 112.  We believe that third quarter gross margins represent a trough for this cycle and anticipate a gradual improvement in gross margins going forward as our product mix stabilizes to historical levels and we gradually begin to increase production levels.  We anticipate more significant increases in gross margins beginning in Q1 and continuing throughout the next fiscal year as we realize the benefits of the manufacturing consolidation and cost reductions that we executed this year.  Capital expenditures were approximately $5 million in Q3. We expect CapEx to be at or slightly below $55 million for the full year. Lower capital spending is the result of lower factory utilization and the outsourcing of advanced CMOS wafer production of higher volume products to Asia.  In the longer term we expect capital spending in future years to continue to be well below current depreciation levels which should create the opportunity for important gross margin expansion as depreciation approximates capital spending.  Operating expenses were $187 million, down $4 million excluding restructuring from the prior quarter and down $53 million from the prior year as were planning for operating expenses to remain under very tight control as business improves.  Other income was $1 million, down from $4 million the prior quarter primarily due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances and interest expense as a result of the issuance of $375 million of five year 5% coupon bonds in Q3. Next quarter we expect to have a full quarters effect of the borrowing and thus expect that other income and expense will swing to an expense of $1 million assuming current interest rates stay the same.  Our tax rate decreased to 18% this quarter as we adjusted our annual tax rate to 20% from the previously expected level of 21%. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 20%.  Weighted average shares outstanding were 293 million this quarter. We expect weighted average shares to increase to 296 million next quarter. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.22, compared to $0.44 in the year ago period and $0.18 in the immediate prior quarter.  Total cash and investments was $1.7 billion, up $439 million from $1.3 billion last quarter due in part to the $375 million bond issuance. Net cash after debt was approximately $1.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $134 million or 27% of sales and we paid out $58 million in dividends during the third quarter.  Our AR balance increased slightly due to the increase in revenue however our DSO stayed relatively flat at 45 days and we have no customers that are late to their payment terms. In summary this was a good financial quarter for ADI. Most of the numbers came in better then our expectations. More importantly we have done a good job positioning the company for great leverage in the future. We have one [inaudible] consolidation behind us and we will begin to see the benefits of the savings from this in the first quarter of our next fiscal year.  The second consolidation is on track to be completed by the end of this fiscal year and we should begin to see the savings from this in the back half of fiscal year 2010. We expect these two consolidations combined will save the company approximately $65 million on an annualized basis.  Ultimately the combination of gross margin and expense leverage could produce significant operating leverage if revenues continue to increase in future quarters. As we stated on our last call our goal is to achieve margins equivalent to our peak margins at lower revenue levels then before, and higher margins at equivalent sales levels.  The actions that we have taken over the past few years to heighten our focus on more profitable and sustainable businesses and to put in place far greater expense discipline should be the catalyst to achieve these objectives as revenues increase.  Now Ill turn the call over the Jerald to discuss key end market trends and our short-term outlook.  Jerald Fishman  The revenues from our broad base of industrial customers were approximately 50% of our revenues during the quarter but still down 29% year over year even though it was up 3% sequentially.  We were very pleased to see that orders and revenues from our factory automation and instrumentation customers increased in Q3 as these companies started to reverse the massive inventory de-stocking of the past year and at the margin are more enthusiastic about their prospects for next year.  And particularly automotive sales were very strong in Q3 driven by increased production rates of European car manufacturers. The revenues from automotive customers increased 21% sequentially although this is still 28% below our third quarter 2008 sales peak in automotive. In the third quarter sales of our battery monitoring, brake sensing, and automotive MEMS products all increased significantly and we won design ins with several hybrid and electric vehicle system suppliers.  Revenues from healthcare customers declined this quarter due to the ongoing capital spending constraints at hospitals in all regions of the world with the exception of China which experienced double-digit growth in healthcare sales for the second consecutive quarter.  Overall design in activity in healthcare customers continues at a very brisk pace and we expect revenues in this market to begin to recover in our fourth quarter. Revenues from defense customers also declined sequentially and year over year as programs were cut and delayed but here too we also believe that order rates in this market have now stabilized.  In the third quarter our revenues from communications customers were about 25% or 26% of total revenues, they were down 15% from last year and 9% sequentially. Communications infrastructure revenues decreased quarter to quarter with declines in sales of base station and optical products and an increase in sales of networking products.  With respect to base stations, revenues from our non-Chinese base station customers which still represents the largest portion of our base station business were approximately flat sequentially. This was more then offset on the negative side by the sequential decrease in revenues from our Chinese base station customers who slowed their spending in Q3 as we expected making inventory corrections following accelerated buying for those customers in the first half of our fiscal year.  In total our base station revenues are now expected to improve in Q4 with the strongest improvement at Chinese customers who have now normalized their inventory of ADI products. In addition trends such as network management outsourcing, the transition to mobile data in developing regions and the progressive rollout of the more data centric 3G and 4G standards should serve as critical growth drivers for our communications infrastructure business in the future.  During Q3 revenues from our handset customers increased sequentially as a result of strong demand for our imaging, auto, RF, power management, and high speed internet connect products to market leading customers. We expect the revenues from this market to continue to increase in Q4 albeit at a somewhat slower rate then Q3.  The revenues from the consumer end market were 21% of revenues but down 21% year over year but up 28% sequentially from the second quarter. The declines in the consumer end market we experienced in the first half of the year were at least partially driven by inventory depletion which now appears to be behind us.  As a result our consumer revenues have now moved closer to end consumption with sales increasing for the second consecutive quarter albeit at a much more significant rate in Q3 then in Q2. Also contributing to our growth in the consumer market in Q3 were an increase in sales of our analog front ends and cameras, HDMI products, and MEMS solutions into consumer related products.  Revenues from our computer customers which are now a diminimous portion of our sales, less then 2% declined both year over year and sequentially. As weve mentioned in previous quarters weve significantly reduced or eliminated investments in application specific products for computers given what we see as a very limited opportunity for high performance signal processing in the computer market.  So now well turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, for our fourth quarter were planning for our revenues to grow to a range of $510 to $530 million. Thats a sequential increase of between 4% and 8%. This plan is based on assumptions that consumer revenues will grow seasonally as is typical in our Q4, industrial revenues will gradually increase again and our communications infrastructure sales will increase from Q3 levels.  We expect increases in sales from both OEM and also from distributor customers. Its very important to note that at ADI we dont get any revenue increases from distributor restocking orders since we only record revenues when our products are sold to end customers, [inaudible] were 100% on sell through and thats true for ADI both domestically and internationally.  We believe thats a more intelligent and stable way to recognize revenue then to recognize revenue when distributor move their inventories up and down. We are planning for our gross margins to be approximately 55% in line with our plans for a small increase in factory utilization and still lower days of inventory that were planning for Q4. As we mentioned earlier our goal is to continue to maintain very disciplined control of all our operating expenses and as a result were planning for only a very slight increase of 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter.  This would produce earnings from our continuing operations in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 in Q4. We expect operating cash flow to again be very strong in the quarter in line with higher revenues, higher gross margins, tight expense control, tight inventory control, and continued very low capital spending.  So I would say in conclusion were more optimistic then we were last quarter. There is increasing evidence that our business has stabilized. Importantly we have and will continue to leverage this cycle to fundamentally realign ADIs product portfolio and cost structure to become a much more competitive company, without damaging the innovation engine that has been the heart of our success for many years. Throughout this recent downturn we continue to invest very heavily in new technology to ensure our future growth rates. For example during the past four quarters alone weve introduced well over 300 new products which is a recent record for ADI. Moreover our design pipeline is up significantly, a testament to the fact that despite all of the economic uncertainty around the world, innovation and technology and at ADI continues.  This combined with the very significant leverage thats now inherent in our business model should bode very well for ADI for our customers and also for our shareholders as conditions continue to improve.  So with that well open up the lines for questions from any analysts.    Question-and-Answer Session  Operator   Your first question comes from the line of Uche Orji - UBS Uche Orji - UBS Let me ask you with the comments youre giving by how much do you think utilization rates will go up next quarter and when should we expect that to naturally start to impact gross margins, so if we look a little bit further down the line, am Im not trying to ask you to give me a definite guidance because many things can effect the January quarter, but if utilization rate rises in the current quarter should we expect that impact gross margin in the following quarter.  David Zinsner  The utilization is going to go up by a couple of points next quarter and that will impact gross margins thats one of the reasons why were guiding up about 90 basis points or so. Our expectation is that utilization start to pick up, it obviously depends on how the market performs over the next several quarters but if it continues to go up and to the right, our expectation is that we would start to bring utilization up during that time. Were now at a point in terms of inventory where we kind of like where the days of inventory are. We think inventory days will be down a few more days but were at a point now where I think we can start to tick up utilization. Now might be a good time to go into gross margins because thats kind of the corollary with utilization. Our expectation is given our mix profile on a long-term basis we really believe that we can get our gross margin into the low 60s. We have obviously a number of tailwinds that are going to impact gross margins going forward as I talked about our limerick six inch line is for the most part now closed. Thats $25 million of annualized savings and that will start impacting the P&amp;L in the first quarter of next year. We have about $40 million of savings coming from the closure of Cambridge which will come to completion at the end of this fiscal year and once we get through the old inventory in the first half of the year by sometime in the second half of the year well start to see the annualized benefit of that.  On top of that we have really have done an outstanding job on capital spending. Our capital spending this year will be $55 million. A couple of years ago I think it was running in the $150 million range. We really see now given our model what we think well use internally versus externally that really somewhere in the $50 to $60 million of capital spending per year is really the go forward model for us.  Our depreciation right now is running I think this quarter on an annualized basis is running somewhere between $120 and $130 million. So eventually that depreciation on an annualized basis will move from $120 to $130 a year to somewhere in the $50 to $60 million over the next several years. Thats going to have a definite tailwind to gross margin and immediately will have a very good benefit on our free cash flow. Uche Orji - UBS If I look at the Chinese business that you talked about on the base station side, first of all do you think you were disproportionately impacted with regards to the inventory [inaudible] correction and obviously demand has come back, do you think that the demand youre seeing now is more in line with their consumption and if you look for that down, given what you know with that marketplace do you think that, what is your sense as to when we might experience it slip again, or do you think from here it should be stable for a little bit longer.  Jerald Fishman  The largest part of our base station business as I said in my earlier comments over 50% is not in China and that part has been relatively stable and we expect it to be stable going forward. The Chinese part as you might remember from the first and second quarter that was sort of keeping us alive when the world was coming unglued in the first and second quarter.  And what really happened over there and I think its been well publicized and written about is the Chinese companies were really gearing up pretty hard and didnt want to be out of inventory so it looks like they built some good sized inventory in the first and second quarter and so they bought more then they consumed during that quarter and I think thats a result, the reason why theres been so much chatter in the marketplace about whats going on there is they just have too much inventory. And I think everybody who is supplying to them, some people will take it all in one quarter, some will take it over a couple of quarters, but I think they just cut back on inventory across the board as far as we could see. We expect that in our fourth quarter coming up the Chinese market is going to recover from us from where it was in this quarter and we expect in Q4 thats going to go up again. So our sense is thats an important business for us. Its one of the higher margin businesses that we have. We have great customers, we have very strong position on our analog products in that business that our market share is extremely high and thats going to be a very good business for us going forward.  It did cost us a bunch of sales this quarter relative to the quarter before and certainly that put pressure on the margins a little bit but theres every reason to expect thats going to continue to be a very important business once its inventory correction. And I think for analog its just going to be one quarter correction given the way that its flowing at least from the forecast that we now have from the large Chinese customers for the quarter and the first quarter.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah - Barclays Capital Romit Shah - Barclays Capital Just a question again on utilization given that inventories will probably drop down below 110 days, thats at the low end of where theyve been historically and so given that and the fact that your customers and distributors are feeling better about their business, why are we not raising production levels more aggressively.  Jerald Fishman  Well because we dont think we need to. What were trying to do in analog now is theres a bunch of different factors. One is we dont want the lead times to extend so we want to make sure we have enough inventory but I think we have, we believe we can run the business with less inventory then we used to. So I think its a balancing act and we are going to turn it up a little this quarter and were going to watch it through the quarter and then well see what happens and if it turns out that the order rates continue to improve at the rates theyve been its possible well turn it up a little bit faster. And certainly it depends on the mix of products, how many of those are internal.  It really depends on what happens with the industrial business. If it turns out all the increases we see in other businesses then thats not going to help our utilization but thats not what we expect. We expect a couple of percent up again in the industrial business next quarter and were going to set the capacities to follow that trend. And like I said if it turns out its better then that, we hope it is, well turn it up a little harder.  Romit Shah - Barclays Capital Your guidance for the industrial business in Q4 include automotive.  Jerald Fishman  Yes, but it also includes non-automotive which I think, we saw a large increase last quarter in automotive. I dont expect well see another very large increase, I think it was up like 20% plus last quarter so I think a more significant part of the increase in our industrial sales will be more of our traditional industrial products, instrumentation, process control, even were expecting an increase in medical stuff. So thats more the traditional stuff that we really lopsided this quarter on the automotive side but I dont think thats going to continue.  Romit Shah - Barclays Capital And that strengthened the core industrial business, I know you service a lot of customers there but to the best of your ability are we seeing evidence of real end demand improving or is it just an abatement of inventory reduction.  Jerald Fishman  Well certainly the inventory abatement is clear. When you talk to those customers you hear that all the time. I think it varies from customer to customer. There are some customers that are saying well its stable, there are others that are saying, at the margin theyre seeing some improvements.  Now the ones that are talking the most about improvement I would say are in Asia compared to the US but I think overall its a mixture of those two, the more tangible part of that is certainly the fact their inventory levels got down pretty low but I think theres another part of it that says that people are sniffing around and beginning to buy a little bit more and theyre more optimistic.  I dont think theyve seen that in terms of their sales yet but I believe from the comments weve gotten theyre seeing that in terms of their communications with their customers and its very interesting with many of those customers, whereas a quarter or two ago they couldnt get rid of inventory fast enough.  With many of those customers now, they are now concerned that with the more confident view some of their customers have about the future that their inventories are too low. So well have to see how that comes out over the next quarter or two but thats the reason why were being a little bit cautious and believe me it would be very easy to ramp the fabs and put another couple hundred basis points of gross margin on next quarter.  The temptation to do that is great, I can assure you. But I dont think quite yet its the right time to do that. And particularly because of some of the comments and concerns that youre expressing.  Romit Shah - Barclays Capital This year has been very unseasonal but is the January quarter normally a growth quarter for ADI.  Jerald Fishman  It all depends. What happens in the typical quarter is that the consumer business starts to contract in first quarter because they bought everything theyre going to buy in our fourth quarter and the industrial business its a question of how much vacations people take or not. So typically the first quarter is not a very strong quarter for us but this year is very atypical.  And David and I have these conversations all the time. I think the next couple of quarters are going to be much more related to secular trends then seasonal trends and I would expect Q1 is going to be the same way this year.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie - Raymond James Steve Smigie - Raymond James I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the amplifier business, that business seemed a little bit softer in the quarter and then also just generally on converters that seemed fairly strong. Jerald Fishman  Well that had to do with which market segments are really moving one way or the other. In the converter business we sell a lot of converters into the consumer business. We sell converters into cameras and a bunch of other products in the consumer area so that tends, given the growth rate of the consumer business that tends to drive that a little bit.  On the amplifier side as best as we can sort that out for the quarter it seems like most of that was declines in our base station business where we sell a lot of amplifiers. But the base line is relatively stable so if the margin, these couple of percent increases or decreases per quarter seem to be more relevant to which market segment is growing then anything to do with the products.  Those products sell into every market segment, some more so then others. So thats much more determinant of what happens on a quarter to quarter basis. In the long-term of course the strength of the product group is important but in the short-term it mostly related to the segments. Steve Smigie - Raymond James And then in terms of the new products you discussed earlier in the call, is there any particular weighting within those new products towards converters versus other products, help us think about where the growth there is maybe by product going forward.  Jerald Fishman  Theyre all over the place. Over the last couple of quarters weve introduced a very large amount of power management products after investing in that business for quite a while, but on the other hand we introduced a lot of converters. Thats our most important business. A lot of amplifiers, a lot of new MEMS products, its really pretty much across the board. Its not anyplace that is really sure.  The only place where weve really not had any new products is as I mentioned in the computer space for application specific computer products. Were not introducing too many of those. And of course weve decreased our investments in other businesses over the last couple of years.  So I think its pretty much across the board of the businesses that are still today strategically relevant to us.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Given the mix dynamic impacting gross margins can you give us an idea of the range of gross margins within your end market segments.  Jerald Fishman  I would say that they, if I look at the, I can only talk about standard gross margins right now but Id say the range is low 50s to high 70s or low 80s. We dont have any segment where the standard gross margins are below 50.  Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank  And the hierarchy is about the same between those four segments if you could just list those again.  Jerald Fishman  Well in the base station business its extremely high. The industrial business is extremely high. The military business is extremely high and that cost us a little last quarter because military sales were down quite a bit last quarter for us. The consumer business is on the low end of that spectrum as is the automotive business.  And everything else is somewhere in between. So I think the important takeaway about this quarter is I dont think theres any fundamental shift in what the mix is going to be of our products. There are unusually strong bounce back in consumer and automotive mostly because they were down so low. Theyve seen the biggest decreases but I think over time we believe our revenue mix is stable and this quarter it was sort of lopsided. We had the highest margin business go the wrong way by quite a bit, the lowest margin businesses go higher by quite a bit even though those lower margin businesses are better then the gross margin that many people would love to have in this business. So thats the mix.  Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank And if I look at the internally produced wafers versus where you use foundry can you update us on what percentage of those are today and where you think that can go over the next year or so.  David Zinsner  Theyre roughly 50/50 today give or take. I think the expectation is that over time industrial will become a bigger mix of our business again and if thats the case then obviously utilization internally will start to ramp up.  Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank On the OpEx side of things, last quarter I think you talked about what percentage of the cuts were temporary versus permanent can you just walk us through if we should be on the look out for any of those temporary cost cuts reversing themselves.  David Zinsner  Actually some of the temporary is phasing back in this quarter and in fact were actually finding some offsets to that which is why the expenses are only going up by about a percent or two. Were down roughly from peak to trough about $53 million and just a little over $20 million was related to bonuses and shut down expenses, forced time off for our employees.  A lot of that stuff is, a fair amount of that is phasing back in next quarter. I dont even think thats a great way to look at our OpEx. I mean really what were doing is trying to manage our OpEx going forward to where we really constrain it over time regardless of what sort of temporary expenses might come back in.  This quarter well start to formulate our plan, our five year plan plus build the first year of that into a budget and I can tell you that Jerald and the team are very, very focused on making sure that OpEx stays in very, very tight control so that as revenue starts to ramp, as gross margins start to come back, we should start to see really, really nice leverage to the bottom line.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wu [TC Research] David Wu [TC Research] I got a question on gross margins, if your mix were normal and we get back some time in the second half of fiscal 2010 lets say a $600 million quarter rate, what should I expect in terms of gross margin, the effect of all the consolidation would have been in place and your industrial would be back to normal, should we think about high 50s at $600 million run rate or even 60%.  David Zinsner  Thats part of what I was saying before, our expectation is given our, if our mix is consistent with what its been in the past which we believe it will over time, given the amount of other tailwinds weve got in terms of fab consolidations and the depreciation rolling off, that we really should be in the low 60s.  David Wu [TC Research] At $600 million a quarter.  David Zinsner  In that general vicinity. Obviously the mix plays some part of it. But yes.  David Wu [TC Research] So its the mix that is much more important then absolute dollar revenue.  David Zinsner  Well I think where we are today at 54%, the real issue is getting our fab back in line, getting utilization up and really its a function of the industrial business coming back. Id say thats the bigger driver. I guess that is mix in and of itself.  Jerald Fishman  Its also revenue growth. If everything just keeps down, but the mix shifts around, its not going to help us much more in the industrial business. So to some degree its dependent on the absolute dollars or revenues on the industrial and some other market segments that we build internally as compared to where to we build externally.  David Wu [TC Research] The other thing I was wondering is in terms of OpEx I assume that this is, next fiscal year will be one of the years where we can have a three or four [weeks] difference between revenue growth and expense growth, if revenue growth will be up double-digit, low single-digit. If we have double-digit revenue growth for your business next fiscal year, should I think about your OpEx as up only low single-digit to support a double-digit top line growth.  Jerald Fishman  Well give you a little more sense of that when we put our plan together, but certainly as David and I are thinking about this thing were thinking of serious constraints on the OpEx next year independent of the revenues. So well give you a little more guidance on that when we close the plans. Were a little loathe to make a statement on that before we have a plan behind it but I can just give you what in my and David said, as we start putting together the objectives for the company for next year.  David Wu [TC Research] Tax rate will be about 20% next year also roughly.  David Zinsner  Yes, in that range.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs My question was on lead times you had alluded I think during the call that the goal is not to have lead times stretch out, I was just curious if you have seen any change in your lead times yet.  Jerald Fishman  Not really, a couple of little things here and there but no, Id say our lead times have been about what they were last quarter. Theyre very short.  Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs More on the administrative side, in terms of your interest and other expense you talked about it being an expense in Q4, how should we think about it in fiscal 2010. Do you expect to start generating interest income as we head into next year.  Jerald Fishman  Can you tell us what the interest rates are going to be? We got a lot of net cash. So the way to think about it is it really depends on we have that money very conservatively invested. Thats the bad news. The good news is we havent lost any of it which is the real goal and so I think it really depends on interest rates. If short-term rates or secure rates begin to move up, well do better.  If they stay at approximately zero probably not.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird Based on your order visibility do you expect the October quarter to be front end loaded or back end loaded from a shipment standpoint.  Jerald Fishman  I think it will be about linear, most of our quarters are, and theres no reason to think this quarter will be much different then that. The backlog is good starting out. The first couple of weeks in August looked pretty good so I would expect it will be relatively linear.  Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird And then regarding your utilization rates and I understand that youre still ramping capacity this quarter, its less then the end demand as you reduce slightly inventories, but were still a little bit less than 50%, end demand is picking up now but lets assume that there is weakness again next year, what room do you have for additional potential cuts in output versus what youve done so far in terms of consolidation.  Jerald Fishman  I think theres always new things that I dont want to speculate on hypotheticals here, but I think what weve demonstrated is that when the revenues went down 20%, 25% we dropped the OpEx by similar amounts and I think were sort of committed to those kind of things so well respond if we have to in a way thats responsible just like we did in this cycle. And as I look at it and see what weve been able to do during this cycle in terms of getting the costs down, I think we did a pretty good job of that and people in the company did a pretty good job of that.  And I think we did a better job then historically weve been known to do as the cycles have gone down. So I think well have to wait and see how that turns out.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely - JPMorgan Christopher Danely - JPMorgan Can you just give us your sense on how you see the end markets progressing going forward here. Do you think that were done with the inventory restocking and consumer and now were going to start in industrial, or just how you expect the recovery to play out now that weve bottomed.  Jerald Fishman  I think theres still more restocking to go on in the industrial business because I think we commented on this last time that our sales into the industrial market were down 30 some odd percent and our customers business wasnt down 30 some odd percent. So I think that theres probably some more to go in the industrial business and it seems like in the consumer business the inventory levels were okay and now in the communication infrastructure business the inventory levels seem to be okay.  I think in the industrial market of course the recovery has lagged those markets a little bit so were hoping that continues and we can get back to more rational levels of production for the industrial customers over the next couple of quarters. But well have to wait and see how that really turns out.  Christopher Danely - JPMorgan And so I guess you think that industrial wont be sort of this one quarter of pop, it will be more spread out over the next couple of quarters.  Jerald Fishman  Thats my belief because the, were still operating at numbers that are well, well, well below where we were four quarters ago. And were enthusiastic that weve seen the beginnings of a recovery but we havent seen a lot of it yet and our hope is that continues for the next couple of quarters but I think it will be more gradual then say the recovery in consumer or automotive, yes.  Thats what I believe. Christopher Danely - JPMorgan When you talk to the distributors how is there behavior these days. Are they ready to start restocking a little bit of certain products yet or do you still see them looking to take down inventory. Jerald Fishman  No, I think this was the first quarter if Im correct about this, correct me if Im wrong, where distributor inventory didnt go down.  David Zinsner   It was down just a hair. Jerald Fishman  Just a little bit, gone down quite a bit before, and so I think at the margin they seem to be as much concerned that theyre going to miss the next cycle on the upside as theyre going to wind up with too much inventory on the down side. So I think distributor are going to demonstrate the usual patterns of they want to be on the right of the cycle and I sense that theyre trying to get on the right side of the cycle being that they expect some growth coming up in the next couple of quarters.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen - Citigroup Terence Whalen - Citigroup I think a lot of the blocking and tackling has already been done, if I could revisit the topic of gross margin not with regard to the October quarter but to the January quarter, it sounds like we could get an increase in utilization as sort of maybe consumer begins to pull back in the January quarter and as industrial begins to build in the first half if Im to think about the levers between utilization and mix and I know they are correlated, which is going to be the dominant driver to drive gross margin and I think it might have been Jerald, you had said we could get it up a couple of points and I think David you earlier said its going to increase at a faster rate then the 90 bps in October, can you just put those together and help me understand that a little bit better.  David Zinsner  I think its tough to say, I mean really theyre almost so correlated together. When industrial mix improves it also improves our utilization which thus improves our gross margin so industrial is a pretty big component of our gross margin and I think Jerald is right in that I dont know that seasonality is a really big component but if you believe that were in the beginning of a recovery in industrial and industrial starts to improve again in the first quarter then well clearly see gross margin improvement in the first quarter. Jerald Fishman  Plus we have some tailwinds in some of the restructuring things that David talked about which ought to start to appear some time in first or second quarter so were more optimistic about the gross margin then weve been in a while because some of these improvements were already dialed in and theyre going to happen unless the world falls off the cliff completely and others are going to be dependent on the mix and the industrial business, better utilization but others are going, these are serious cost reductions and serious consolidations that weve done and the capital spending, when youre spending what were spending now eventually it starts matching depreciation. So I dont know, we have a lot of tailwinds on this thing and I dont think we have many headwinds on the gross margin because I think the mix is going to revert back to the historical mix of the company. Theres no reason to believe it going to get lopsided towards consumer or automotive which carries somewhat lower gross margin.  So I think when you add it all up, the 10,000 products and 100,000 customers we sell to we think the mix is going to be about the same when its all said and done.  Terence Whalen - Citigroup Related to that, can you talk a little bit about the consumer business, its not a business I have great visibility into. I typically think of things like digital still cameras, and things like home audio and video can you just revisit that segment again and is that a segment that would decline just naturally with seasonality in January or would that be April. Jerald Fishman  Yes, typically what happens is in the consumer business customers order up which is why our fourth quarter is usually reasonably good consumer quarter before the holidays and then all of a sudden it comes the first quarter and they realized either they sold not enough or too many and make adjustments. Then the Chinese New Year comes in February and so Id say our fourth quarter is probably going to be our peak consumer quarter as a percentage of revenues.  At least thats our planning assumption going forward.  Terence Whalen - Citigroup And then granularity on the revenues, if you could help us with that a little bit just to get a feel for what applications are really driving growth there.  Jerald Fishman  Well certainly for many years weve had a very strong position in the camera business, weve developed strong positions in segments of the high definition TV business, not so much related to the signal processing, the big digital processors which we dont do, but a lot of the peripheral functions that are in TVs, HDMI and other things.  We have a MEMS business which has a consumer content of it. Were starting to build microphones for consumer products and those look like theyre going to be very successful products. We have a lot of audio, very high end audio products into the consumer mix so what we try to do in the consumer business is focus on the application where what we do really changes the sight, the sound or the experience and not spend much resources focusing on things that rapidly commoditize and therefore have impaired gross margin forever. We have a lot of rules we are putting in place in analog about what kind of consumer applications were after and our sense increasingly is the way you see the quality of the technology in consumer products is, you look at the gross margin and if people arent willing to pay anything for it it may be great stuff, but its not worth much. So if it makes a big difference to the customer, if they can get more money for it in their end product, then those are good applications and if theyre not, theyre not very useful for us.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wong - Wells Fargo  David Wong - Wells Fargo  You mentioned just now that you were somewhat less interested in the computer end market can you tell us what segments both in terms of product type converters or so on or the end market you are particularly interested in in channeling your R&amp;D dollars. Jerald Fishman  Well certainly the industrial market has been a goldmine for analog for many years. Its highly fragmented. Theres thousands and thousands of customers lifecycles are long, the margins are high, its sort of like a perfect business school example of a great business to be in. We have a brand that sells the products, customers call us first, thats a great business and if we let the R&amp;D drift away from that business wed be total fools in my opinion.  The communication segments of the communications business have been very, very good businesses for us. The base station business certainly many other parts of communication infrastructure have been good businesses for us. Even though weve withdrawn from the base band processor in the handsets, many of the smart phones and other things have a lot of good analog functionality attached to them.  Youve probably seen it if you use those phones. We get paid for that functionality in the higher end phones. And of course many high end consumer products are very, theyre bundles of signal processing technology that impact sound, what you hear and so on. So I think we looked at the computer market a year or two ago and said, the rate of commoditization is high, we sold the business that was building power management products for PCs. We just didnt see where the value of that was for analog devices and we just look inside a personal computer today and we just dont see a lot of functions where our products can really make a consumer buy a particular PC or not and our experience is if you cant say that then its not very valuable business for us.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein I had a question on the industrial and auto so you said that I know auto was up tremendously in the quarter, you said it was driven in part by a strength in Europe, I note that though Europe itself was still flat, North America was down, is it fair to say that industrial was all in the US and Europe was actually down in the quarter.  Jerald Fishman  I dont think so, I think they were about flat. So there were obviously some other things there. The automotive business in Europe isnt all that large that it carries a huge amount of weight on the revenues so our automotive sales are 7% or 8% of our total sales and so I dont think those numbers are determinant to the total right now.  Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein And it sounds like recently youre hearing more positive feedback in the industrial is coming out of Asia are you hearing anything positive at all coming out of North America and Europe because I would assume that the bulk of your industrial sales are still in the US and in Europe. Jerald Fishman  Yes they are. And thats changing but its going to take awhile for them for equal whats going on in the US and Europe given the position that we have. I think as weve talked to US and European customers theyre at the margin more optimistic, theyre cautious. I think their optimism is more from what I heard personally more related to 2010 then 2009, at least our 2010 which begins in November. So I think that business is going to come back. The US industrial world is under pressure but its not under the kind of pressure that weve seen in our orders from industrial customers. The US isnt completely dead yet although well have to see how all the policies and practices that people are talking about actually impacts US industrial companies but I think at the margin you hear from most of the customers and you guys listen to the reports of those customers, at the margin theyre a little bit more optimistic.  And I think weve seen these cycles before and this one certainly is a lot worse then others but these things come back and it takes a while and the industrial market always comes back a little slower then some of the more faster moving markets like handsets and PCs and so on, but its going to come back, its just going to come back more gradually then other markets.  Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein On the strength that youre seeing in industrial in Asia how much do you think of that is being driven by a government stimulus spending and how sustainable do you think it actually is Jerald Fishman  I think some of it clearly is, but our industrial sales in China were growing at a pretty good clip before anyone decided to put more money into it. Thats a franchise that if it was just stimulus we wouldnt see much because the design cycles of some of those products can be two or three years so our sense is yes, thats helping at the margin a little bit.  But its a base of business that weve been building for the last two or three years well before stimulus became fashionable.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML Just a question on your utilization rates, are you actually taking a period charge given the low levels of utilization and does that persist and if you could quantify that charge if there is one.   David Zinsner   Were certainly under absorbing our expenses within our manufacturing.  Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML I guess the question was but are you expensing that as a period charge in the same quarter as opposed to the impact of the under absorption flowing through the David Zinsner  No, all this kind of works its way through inventory.  Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML Any more thoughts on the convert which occurred I guess during the course of the July quarter, meaning in terms of strategically whats the thought process behind it.  Jerald Fishman  We did a straight debt financing for $375 million and thats a five year fixed note. We wound up swapping it for floating rate given all the cash we have so if interest rates go up we have plenty of cash, we have plenty of interest were going to get on the other side. The thought with that was actually very simple, it was that a large part of our cash balance are offshore. We dont really want to bring it back right now.  And we were relatively committed to the US dividend so we just wanted to build a little more cushion in to whatever happens that we dont have to think about that and that was why we did it. We wound up with an A credit, we wound up being able to borrow money at very low rates very quickly I would say.  And there was a lot of competition for those bonds which is why the pricing came out where it did. It was more of an insurance policy then anything else given that the world is a very uncertain place. And it became available and the rates looked good and the demand was very high.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Just to follow-up on the operating expense issue, you have done a very good job bringing down OpEx structurally and I know you dont want to give particular guidance for the first quarter of next year, or next year specifically, but as you look at the operating expense structure that you now have do you continue to see opportunity for structural improvement or with the work that youve done this year have you really exhausted the opportunities that you think exist in the model. Jerald Fishman  No I think theres more opportunities. I think where David and I have come out on this thing together is that we went into this cycle with the operating expenses too high in the company even at the revenue levels when they were $650 million a quarter. So weve been banging on this whole question pretty hard for the better part of a year and a half, two years. Some of that is getting out of businesses where the OpEx ratios were absurd relative to the returns.  Other parts of it were just tightening up a lot of things around the company. I think those, what were communicating around Analog is thats not a one time thing that you only do when business is bad, we believe we have a lot of OpEx leverage in this company that we can get with tenacity and we understand the implications of getting that leverage on what our stock is worth ultimately so were going to work hard to get that leverage. And weve done some things, theres more to do. Theres lots of different things we can to do tighten up the expense structure of the company. We continuously look at businesses more critically for those that are either because the competition has changed, the market structure has changed, some cases we didnt get the products out in time, products arent any good, to look at these businesses very often and say is this still meeting our strategic content or the intent for getting into those businesses to begin with.  Theres lots of ways to tighten up the R&amp;D process in the company, selling process, the administrative processes in the company, and were continuously working on all of those. We havent called the dogs off yet and I dont expect we will next year either.  Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Yes, keep the dogs going at it.  Jerald Fishman  Weve got a lot of big dogs barking at us on the operating expenses.  Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Relatedly when you shut down the two fabs is there any incremental savings in the middle of the income statement or does it all flow into COGS. David Zinsner   Id say most of it falls into COGS. There is a little bit within the IT and R&amp;D function that does come out too, but its relatively small.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley The impact, when you shut down a factory is the impact to gross margin purely a function of the cost savings that you discussed or are there puts and takes incrementally either positive or negative associated with ramping production of new products at the new factory, either improving yields or yield hiccups as youre ramping the new product. Jerald Fishman  Our experience has been when you start ramping down a fab and ramping it up at a location as you wind up with cost increases in the interim because the yield, people stop focusing on it, these arent large numbers but I think at the margin it costs you a little bit of margin while youre doing it, but once you do it and youre done, and you got a group of people that are now focused on yield improvement on those products in the location where the products are actually going to be built, you see a very rapid turnaround.  At least thats been our experience in doing these things before.  Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley  With the inventory days coming down I have to believe that the effective lead times nudged up a little bit and the question for you is in your experience is extending lead times translate to double ordering on a linear basis, for example if the lead times go up theres more propensity for customers distributors to double order or is it more like a step function, say you hit lead times of 10, 12, 14, 16 weeks or something like that and then at some magical threshold you get a step function and double ordering.  Jerald Fishman  I think it winds up being more of a step function then you think because its not based on the lead time for this product went from four weeks to five weeks or three weeks to four weeks. Its based on a general fear that develops in the industry when they hear of shortages and that fear in the internet age usually you see within a period of one or two months.  Certainly we saw the inverse fear when the world collapsed on us that within a very, very short period of time, everybody panicked and stopped ordering everything and so I think there are trigger points on that. It doesnt happen every place at the same time but the response to the markets to perceive shortages is usually quite rapid in my experience.  But I dont think were seeing that. At least for our type of products I dont think any of our competitors that really stretched out the lead times, I dont think theres any, I dont get any calls from customers worrying about this or so, I think at the margin lead times are under pretty good control. At least at this point.  Operator There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments.

Q3 2009 Earnings Call August 18, 2009 5:00 PM ET Operator At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Analog Devices fiscal third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Miss Kohl, you may begin your conference. Mindy Kohl Good afternoon everyone. This is Mindy Kohl, Director of Investor Relations for Analog Devices. We really appreciate you joining us for today's call. If you have not yet seen our third quarter fiscal 2009 release, you can access it on the home page of our IR website at www.investor.analog.com.  This conference call is also being broadcast live on the Internet and the web cast may be accessed by clicking on the microphone icon on the home page of our IR website. A recording of this conference call will be available today within about two hours of the calls completion and will remain available via phone and Internet playback for one week. This web cast will also be archived on our IR website.  Participating in todays call are Jerald Fishman, President and CEO, and David Zinsner, Vice President of Finance and CFO. During the first part of the call Jerald and David will present our third quarter results and our short-term outlook and then we will open it up for questions during the latter part of the call. During todays call, we will refer to several non-GAAP financial measures that have been adjusted for one-time items in order to provide investors with useful information regarding our results of operations and business trends. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in todays earnings release, which is now posted on the IR website. Weve also updated the schedules on our IR website, which include the historical quarterly and annual summary P&amp;Ls for continuing operations as well as historical quarterly and annual information for product revenue from continuing operations by end market and by product type.  Next, Id ask you to please note that the information we are about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which include risks and uncertainties. The companys actual results could differ materially from those we will be discussing.  Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in the companys SEC filings, including our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed this afternoon.  The forward-looking information that is provided by the company in this call represents the companys outlook as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements made by us. Subsequent events and developments may cause the companys outlook to change. Therefore, this conference call will include time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, which is August 18, 2009. With that, Ill turn the call over to Jerald Fishman. Jerald Fishman Good afternoon and thanks for joining us on todays call. As you can see from the press release and the 10-Q, we had a very solid quarter with sequential revenue growth of 4% and earnings growth of about 22%.  These results were both ahead of our plan as orders were stronger then we predicted throughout the quarter. On a sequential basis revenues grew 28% in the consumer market, 21% in the automotive market and 3% in the industrial market.  Communications revenues declined 9% sequentially as we expected as our largest wireless infrastructure customers in Asia reduced their order levels to lower their inventories. Sales to handset customers increased during the quarter in line with all these market trends, our revenues were approximately flat in the US and Europe, up in Japan, and declined slightly in Asia, mostly as a result of Chinese infrastructure revenue declines.  Orders on ADI grew significantly in Q3, the result of a generally more positive outlook at most of our customers and also our distributors restocking after many quarters of reducing their inventory.  As a result our book to bill ratio was above one for the quarter and our backlog increased. Distributor orders on ADI were higher than orders from our end customers on our distributors which is typical in this phase of the business cycle where the distributors are restocking their shelves.  Overall our sense is that customers and distributors are more confident as they believe theyve seen the low point of the cycle and theyre now planning for some growth in the future. I think most importantly orders from our industrial customers increased sequentially for the first time in many quarters.  Given the importance of the industrial market to ADI weve now surveyed our largest industrial customers to better understand their expectations for the near-term future. Generally our most optimistic industrial customers are in Asia where growth prospects are the strongest and ADI is building a very significant industrial franchise that replicates our leadership position built over many years in the industrial markets in the United States and Europe. Overall most industrial customers across all the regions including the US and Europe believe that business has stabilized and they are planning for a continued gradual recovery later this year and into 2010. During Q3 our gross margins declined by about 100 basis points to 54.1% which was in line with the expectations given the somewhat lopsided mix of business that was atypical for the quarter. At this point in the cycle we believe weve now reached the trough for gross margins.  The industrial business is now beginning to grow and our inventory levels are now back in line with our model so utilization will begin to increase in our fourth quarter. As we said last quarter we believe were at the very beginnings of a fairly significant ramp in gross margins in 2010 and beyond.  Operating margins improved to 16% of sales. We continue to see the benefits of previous restructuring actions as operating expenses declined by an additional $4 million or approximately 2% sequentially representing now a cumulative decline of more than $53 million on a quarterly basis or 22% excluding restructuring costs since the end of the prior year period.  We believe that ADI is now in a very strong position, perhaps the strongest in our recent history. During the downturn we continue to invest significantly in new product development to further improve our portfolio and our competitive position.  At the same time we reduce our costs by over 20% a portion of which are permanent cost reductions. We believe that the third quarter as I said earlier marked the low point for our gross margins in the cycle and the tangible benefits of our margin improvement initiatives are just beginning to unfold.  We are planning to tightly manage operating expenses in this cycle so that our earnings can grow much faster then our revenues. As we finalize next years operating plan later this quarter well be able to provide more specific guidance regarding our financial goals for fiscal 2010 and we hope to do that, or be ready to talk about that by next quarters call.  So now Ill turn the podium over here to David who is going to review the financials in a bit more detail.  David Zinsner  Thanks Jerald, as Jerald stated revenues were $492 million, a 4% increase from the prior quarter and a 25% decrease from the prior year. Orders increased this quarter and we closed the quarter with a book to bill that was above one.  Gross margins were 54.1% which was within our forecasted range of 54% to 55%. This was down from the 55.1% we reported in Q2 due to a greater mix of consumer and automotive revenue and less communications infrastructure revenue.  In addition factory utilization remained low at approximately 45% as we continued to focus on reducing inventory levels in the third quarter. Inventory on our balance sheet declined by $29 million this quarter and our days of inventory are now at 112.  We believe that third quarter gross margins represent a trough for this cycle and anticipate a gradual improvement in gross margins going forward as our product mix stabilizes to historical levels and we gradually begin to increase production levels.  We anticipate more significant increases in gross margins beginning in Q1 and continuing throughout the next fiscal year as we realize the benefits of the manufacturing consolidation and cost reductions that we executed this year.  Capital expenditures were approximately $5 million in Q3. We expect CapEx to be at or slightly below $55 million for the full year. Lower capital spending is the result of lower factory utilization and the outsourcing of advanced CMOS wafer production of higher volume products to Asia.  In the longer term we expect capital spending in future years to continue to be well below current depreciation levels which should create the opportunity for important gross margin expansion as depreciation approximates capital spending.  Operating expenses were $187 million, down $4 million excluding restructuring from the prior quarter and down $53 million from the prior year as were planning for operating expenses to remain under very tight control as business improves.  Other income was $1 million, down from $4 million the prior quarter primarily due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances and interest expense as a result of the issuance of $375 million of five year 5% coupon bonds in Q3. Next quarter we expect to have a full quarters effect of the borrowing and thus expect that other income and expense will swing to an expense of $1 million assuming current interest rates stay the same.  Our tax rate decreased to 18% this quarter as we adjusted our annual tax rate to 20% from the previously expected level of 21%. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 20%.  Weighted average shares outstanding were 293 million this quarter. We expect weighted average shares to increase to 296 million next quarter. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.22, compared to $0.44 in the year ago period and $0.18 in the immediate prior quarter.  Total cash and investments was $1.7 billion, up $439 million from $1.3 billion last quarter due in part to the $375 million bond issuance. Net cash after debt was approximately $1.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $134 million or 27% of sales and we paid out $58 million in dividends during the third quarter.  Our AR balance increased slightly due to the increase in revenue however our DSO stayed relatively flat at 45 days and we have no customers that are late to their payment terms. In summary this was a good financial quarter for ADI. Most of the numbers came in better then our expectations. More importantly we have done a good job positioning the company for great leverage in the future. We have one [inaudible] consolidation behind us and we will begin to see the benefits of the savings from this in the first quarter of our next fiscal year.  The second consolidation is on track to be completed by the end of this fiscal year and we should begin to see the savings from this in the back half of fiscal year 2010. We expect these two consolidations combined will save the company approximately $65 million on an annualized basis.  Ultimately the combination of gross margin and expense leverage could produce significant operating leverage if revenues continue to increase in future quarters. As we stated on our last call our goal is to achieve margins equivalent to our peak margins at lower revenue levels then before, and higher margins at equivalent sales levels.  The actions that we have taken over the past few years to heighten our focus on more profitable and sustainable businesses and to put in place far greater expense discipline should be the catalyst to achieve these objectives as revenues increase.  Now Ill turn the call over the Jerald to discuss key end market trends and our short-term outlook.  Jerald Fishman  The revenues from our broad base of industrial customers were approximately 50% of our revenues during the quarter but still down 29% year over year even though it was up 3% sequentially.  We were very pleased to see that orders and revenues from our factory automation and instrumentation customers increased in Q3 as these companies started to reverse the massive inventory de-stocking of the past year and at the margin are more enthusiastic about their prospects for next year.  And particularly automotive sales were very strong in Q3 driven by increased production rates of European car manufacturers. The revenues from automotive customers increased 21% sequentially although this is still 28% below our third quarter 2008 sales peak in automotive. In the third quarter sales of our battery monitoring, brake sensing, and automotive MEMS products all increased significantly and we won design ins with several hybrid and electric vehicle system suppliers.  Revenues from healthcare customers declined this quarter due to the ongoing capital spending constraints at hospitals in all regions of the world with the exception of China which experienced double-digit growth in healthcare sales for the second consecutive quarter.  Overall design in activity in healthcare customers continues at a very brisk pace and we expect revenues in this market to begin to recover in our fourth quarter. Revenues from defense customers also declined sequentially and year over year as programs were cut and delayed but here too we also believe that order rates in this market have now stabilized.  In the third quarter our revenues from communications customers were about 25% or 26% of total revenues, they were down 15% from last year and 9% sequentially. Communications infrastructure revenues decreased quarter to quarter with declines in sales of base station and optical products and an increase in sales of networking products.  With respect to base stations, revenues from our non-Chinese base station customers which still represents the largest portion of our base station business were approximately flat sequentially. This was more then offset on the negative side by the sequential decrease in revenues from our Chinese base station customers who slowed their spending in Q3 as we expected making inventory corrections following accelerated buying for those customers in the first half of our fiscal year.  In total our base station revenues are now expected to improve in Q4 with the strongest improvement at Chinese customers who have now normalized their inventory of ADI products. In addition trends such as network management outsourcing, the transition to mobile data in developing regions and the progressive rollout of the more data centric 3G and 4G standards should serve as critical growth drivers for our communications infrastructure business in the future.  During Q3 revenues from our handset customers increased sequentially as a result of strong demand for our imaging, auto, RF, power management, and high speed internet connect products to market leading customers. We expect the revenues from this market to continue to increase in Q4 albeit at a somewhat slower rate then Q3.  The revenues from the consumer end market were 21% of revenues but down 21% year over year but up 28% sequentially from the second quarter. The declines in the consumer end market we experienced in the first half of the year were at least partially driven by inventory depletion which now appears to be behind us.  As a result our consumer revenues have now moved closer to end consumption with sales increasing for the second consecutive quarter albeit at a much more significant rate in Q3 then in Q2. Also contributing to our growth in the consumer market in Q3 were an increase in sales of our analog front ends and cameras, HDMI products, and MEMS solutions into consumer related products.  Revenues from our computer customers which are now a diminimous portion of our sales, less then 2% declined both year over year and sequentially. As weve mentioned in previous quarters weve significantly reduced or eliminated investments in application specific products for computers given what we see as a very limited opportunity for high performance signal processing in the computer market.  So now well turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter, for our fourth quarter were planning for our revenues to grow to a range of $510 to $530 million. Thats a sequential increase of between 4% and 8%. This plan is based on assumptions that consumer revenues will grow seasonally as is typical in our Q4, industrial revenues will gradually increase again and our communications infrastructure sales will increase from Q3 levels.  We expect increases in sales from both OEM and also from distributor customers. Its very important to note that at ADI we dont get any revenue increases from distributor restocking orders since we only record revenues when our products are sold to end customers, [inaudible] were 100% on sell through and thats true for ADI both domestically and internationally.  We believe thats a more intelligent and stable way to recognize revenue then to recognize revenue when distributor move their inventories up and down. We are planning for our gross margins to be approximately 55% in line with our plans for a small increase in factory utilization and still lower days of inventory that were planning for Q4. As we mentioned earlier our goal is to continue to maintain very disciplined control of all our operating expenses and as a result were planning for only a very slight increase of 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter.  This would produce earnings from our continuing operations in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 in Q4. We expect operating cash flow to again be very strong in the quarter in line with higher revenues, higher gross margins, tight expense control, tight inventory control, and continued very low capital spending.  So I would say in conclusion were more optimistic then we were last quarter. There is increasing evidence that our business has stabilized. Importantly we have and will continue to leverage this cycle to fundamentally realign ADIs product portfolio and cost structure to become a much more competitive company, without damaging the innovation engine that has been the heart of our success for many years. Throughout this recent downturn we continue to invest very heavily in new technology to ensure our future growth rates. For example during the past four quarters alone weve introduced well over 300 new products which is a recent record for ADI. Moreover our design pipeline is up significantly, a testament to the fact that despite all of the economic uncertainty around the world, innovation and technology and at ADI continues.  This combined with the very significant leverage thats now inherent in our business model should bode very well for ADI for our customers and also for our shareholders as conditions continue to improve.  So with that well open up the lines for questions from any analysts.    Question-and-Answer Session  Operator   Your first question comes from the line of Uche Orji - UBS Uche Orji - UBS Let me ask you with the comments youre giving by how much do you think utilization rates will go up next quarter and when should we expect that to naturally start to impact gross margins, so if we look a little bit further down the line, am Im not trying to ask you to give me a definite guidance because many things can effect the January quarter, but if utilization rate rises in the current quarter should we expect that impact gross margin in the following quarter.  David Zinsner  The utilization is going to go up by a couple of points next quarter and that will impact gross margins thats one of the reasons why were guiding up about 90 basis points or so. Our expectation is that utilization start to pick up, it obviously depends on how the market performs over the next several quarters but if it continues to go up and to the right, our expectation is that we would start to bring utilization up during that time. Were now at a point in terms of inventory where we kind of like where the days of inventory are. We think inventory days will be down a few more days but were at a point now where I think we can start to tick up utilization. Now might be a good time to go into gross margins because thats kind of the corollary with utilization. Our expectation is given our mix profile on a long-term basis we really believe that we can get our gross margin into the low 60s. We have obviously a number of tailwinds that are going to impact gross margins going forward as I talked about our limerick six inch line is for the most part now closed. Thats $25 million of annualized savings and that will start impacting the P&amp;L in the first quarter of next year. We have about $40 million of savings coming from the closure of Cambridge which will come to completion at the end of this fiscal year and once we get through the old inventory in the first half of the year by sometime in the second half of the year well start to see the annualized benefit of that.  On top of that we have really have done an outstanding job on capital spending. Our capital spending this year will be $55 million. A couple of years ago I think it was running in the $150 million range. We really see now given our model what we think well use internally versus externally that really somewhere in the $50 to $60 million of capital spending per year is really the go forward model for us.  Our depreciation right now is running I think this quarter on an annualized basis is running somewhere between $120 and $130 million. So eventually that depreciation on an annualized basis will move from $120 to $130 a year to somewhere in the $50 to $60 million over the next several years. Thats going to have a definite tailwind to gross margin and immediately will have a very good benefit on our free cash flow. Uche Orji - UBS If I look at the Chinese business that you talked about on the base station side, first of all do you think you were disproportionately impacted with regards to the inventory [inaudible] correction and obviously demand has come back, do you think that the demand youre seeing now is more in line with their consumption and if you look for that down, given what you know with that marketplace do you think that, what is your sense as to when we might experience it slip again, or do you think from here it should be stable for a little bit longer.  Jerald Fishman  The largest part of our base station business as I said in my earlier comments over 50% is not in China and that part has been relatively stable and we expect it to be stable going forward. The Chinese part as you might remember from the first and second quarter that was sort of keeping us alive when the world was coming unglued in the first and second quarter.  And what really happened over there and I think its been well publicized and written about is the Chinese companies were really gearing up pretty hard and didnt want to be out of inventory so it looks like they built some good sized inventory in the first and second quarter and so they bought more then they consumed during that quarter and I think thats a result, the reason why theres been so much chatter in the marketplace about whats going on there is they just have too much inventory. And I think everybody who is supplying to them, some people will take it all in one quarter, some will take it over a couple of quarters, but I think they just cut back on inventory across the board as far as we could see. We expect that in our fourth quarter coming up the Chinese market is going to recover from us from where it was in this quarter and we expect in Q4 thats going to go up again. So our sense is thats an important business for us. Its one of the higher margin businesses that we have. We have great customers, we have very strong position on our analog products in that business that our market share is extremely high and thats going to be a very good business for us going forward.  It did cost us a bunch of sales this quarter relative to the quarter before and certainly that put pressure on the margins a little bit but theres every reason to expect thats going to continue to be a very important business once its inventory correction. And I think for analog its just going to be one quarter correction given the way that its flowing at least from the forecast that we now have from the large Chinese customers for the quarter and the first quarter.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah - Barclays Capital Romit Shah - Barclays Capital Just a question again on utilization given that inventories will probably drop down below 110 days, thats at the low end of where theyve been historically and so given that and the fact that your customers and distributors are feeling better about their business, why are we not raising production levels more aggressively.  Jerald Fishman  Well because we dont think we need to. What were trying to do in analog now is theres a bunch of different factors. One is we dont want the lead times to extend so we want to make sure we have enough inventory but I think we have, we believe we can run the business with less inventory then we used to. So I think its a balancing act and we are going to turn it up a little this quarter and were going to watch it through the quarter and then well see what happens and if it turns out that the order rates continue to improve at the rates theyve been its possible well turn it up a little bit faster. And certainly it depends on the mix of products, how many of those are internal.  It really depends on what happens with the industrial business. If it turns out all the increases we see in other businesses then thats not going to help our utilization but thats not what we expect. We expect a couple of percent up again in the industrial business next quarter and were going to set the capacities to follow that trend. And like I said if it turns out its better then that, we hope it is, well turn it up a little harder.  Romit Shah - Barclays Capital Your guidance for the industrial business in Q4 include automotive.  Jerald Fishman  Yes, but it also includes non-automotive which I think, we saw a large increase last quarter in automotive. I dont expect well see another very large increase, I think it was up like 20% plus last quarter so I think a more significant part of the increase in our industrial sales will be more of our traditional industrial products, instrumentation, process control, even were expecting an increase in medical stuff. So thats more the traditional stuff that we really lopsided this quarter on the automotive side but I dont think thats going to continue.  Romit Shah - Barclays Capital And that strengthened the core industrial business, I know you service a lot of customers there but to the best of your ability are we seeing evidence of real end demand improving or is it just an abatement of inventory reduction.  Jerald Fishman  Well certainly the inventory abatement is clear. When you talk to those customers you hear that all the time. I think it varies from customer to customer. There are some customers that are saying well its stable, there are others that are saying, at the margin theyre seeing some improvements.  Now the ones that are talking the most about improvement I would say are in Asia compared to the US but I think overall its a mixture of those two, the more tangible part of that is certainly the fact their inventory levels got down pretty low but I think theres another part of it that says that people are sniffing around and beginning to buy a little bit more and theyre more optimistic.  I dont think theyve seen that in terms of their sales yet but I believe from the comments weve gotten theyre seeing that in terms of their communications with their customers and its very interesting with many of those customers, whereas a quarter or two ago they couldnt get rid of inventory fast enough.  With many of those customers now, they are now concerned that with the more confident view some of their customers have about the future that their inventories are too low. So well have to see how that comes out over the next quarter or two but thats the reason why were being a little bit cautious and believe me it would be very easy to ramp the fabs and put another couple hundred basis points of gross margin on next quarter.  The temptation to do that is great, I can assure you. But I dont think quite yet its the right time to do that. And particularly because of some of the comments and concerns that youre expressing.  Romit Shah - Barclays Capital This year has been very unseasonal but is the January quarter normally a growth quarter for ADI.  Jerald Fishman  It all depends. What happens in the typical quarter is that the consumer business starts to contract in first quarter because they bought everything theyre going to buy in our fourth quarter and the industrial business its a question of how much vacations people take or not. So typically the first quarter is not a very strong quarter for us but this year is very atypical.  And David and I have these conversations all the time. I think the next couple of quarters are going to be much more related to secular trends then seasonal trends and I would expect Q1 is going to be the same way this year.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie - Raymond James Steve Smigie - Raymond James I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the amplifier business, that business seemed a little bit softer in the quarter and then also just generally on converters that seemed fairly strong. Jerald Fishman  Well that had to do with which market segments are really moving one way or the other. In the converter business we sell a lot of converters into the consumer business. We sell converters into cameras and a bunch of other products in the consumer area so that tends, given the growth rate of the consumer business that tends to drive that a little bit.  On the amplifier side as best as we can sort that out for the quarter it seems like most of that was declines in our base station business where we sell a lot of amplifiers. But the base line is relatively stable so if the margin, these couple of percent increases or decreases per quarter seem to be more relevant to which market segment is growing then anything to do with the products.  Those products sell into every market segment, some more so then others. So thats much more determinant of what happens on a quarter to quarter basis. In the long-term of course the strength of the product group is important but in the short-term it mostly related to the segments. Steve Smigie - Raymond James And then in terms of the new products you discussed earlier in the call, is there any particular weighting within those new products towards converters versus other products, help us think about where the growth there is maybe by product going forward.  Jerald Fishman  Theyre all over the place. Over the last couple of quarters weve introduced a very large amount of power management products after investing in that business for quite a while, but on the other hand we introduced a lot of converters. Thats our most important business. A lot of amplifiers, a lot of new MEMS products, its really pretty much across the board. Its not anyplace that is really sure.  The only place where weve really not had any new products is as I mentioned in the computer space for application specific computer products. Were not introducing too many of those. And of course weve decreased our investments in other businesses over the last couple of years.  So I think its pretty much across the board of the businesses that are still today strategically relevant to us.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Given the mix dynamic impacting gross margins can you give us an idea of the range of gross margins within your end market segments.  Jerald Fishman  I would say that they, if I look at the, I can only talk about standard gross margins right now but Id say the range is low 50s to high 70s or low 80s. We dont have any segment where the standard gross margins are below 50.  Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank  And the hierarchy is about the same between those four segments if you could just list those again.  Jerald Fishman  Well in the base station business its extremely high. The industrial business is extremely high. The military business is extremely high and that cost us a little last quarter because military sales were down quite a bit last quarter for us. The consumer business is on the low end of that spectrum as is the automotive business.  And everything else is somewhere in between. So I think the important takeaway about this quarter is I dont think theres any fundamental shift in what the mix is going to be of our products. There are unusually strong bounce back in consumer and automotive mostly because they were down so low. Theyve seen the biggest decreases but I think over time we believe our revenue mix is stable and this quarter it was sort of lopsided. We had the highest margin business go the wrong way by quite a bit, the lowest margin businesses go higher by quite a bit even though those lower margin businesses are better then the gross margin that many people would love to have in this business. So thats the mix.  Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank And if I look at the internally produced wafers versus where you use foundry can you update us on what percentage of those are today and where you think that can go over the next year or so.  David Zinsner  Theyre roughly 50/50 today give or take. I think the expectation is that over time industrial will become a bigger mix of our business again and if thats the case then obviously utilization internally will start to ramp up.  Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank On the OpEx side of things, last quarter I think you talked about what percentage of the cuts were temporary versus permanent can you just walk us through if we should be on the look out for any of those temporary cost cuts reversing themselves.  David Zinsner  Actually some of the temporary is phasing back in this quarter and in fact were actually finding some offsets to that which is why the expenses are only going up by about a percent or two. Were down roughly from peak to trough about $53 million and just a little over $20 million was related to bonuses and shut down expenses, forced time off for our employees.  A lot of that stuff is, a fair amount of that is phasing back in next quarter. I dont even think thats a great way to look at our OpEx. I mean really what were doing is trying to manage our OpEx going forward to where we really constrain it over time regardless of what sort of temporary expenses might come back in.  This quarter well start to formulate our plan, our five year plan plus build the first year of that into a budget and I can tell you that Jerald and the team are very, very focused on making sure that OpEx stays in very, very tight control so that as revenue starts to ramp, as gross margins start to come back, we should start to see really, really nice leverage to the bottom line.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wu [TC Research] David Wu [TC Research] I got a question on gross margins, if your mix were normal and we get back some time in the second half of fiscal 2010 lets say a $600 million quarter rate, what should I expect in terms of gross margin, the effect of all the consolidation would have been in place and your industrial would be back to normal, should we think about high 50s at $600 million run rate or even 60%.  David Zinsner  Thats part of what I was saying before, our expectation is given our, if our mix is consistent with what its been in the past which we believe it will over time, given the amount of other tailwinds weve got in terms of fab consolidations and the depreciation rolling off, that we really should be in the low 60s.  David Wu [TC Research] At $600 million a quarter.  David Zinsner  In that general vicinity. Obviously the mix plays some part of it. But yes.  David Wu [TC Research] So its the mix that is much more important then absolute dollar revenue.  David Zinsner  Well I think where we are today at 54%, the real issue is getting our fab back in line, getting utilization up and really its a function of the industrial business coming back. Id say thats the bigger driver. I guess that is mix in and of itself.  Jerald Fishman  Its also revenue growth. If everything just keeps down, but the mix shifts around, its not going to help us much more in the industrial business. So to some degree its dependent on the absolute dollars or revenues on the industrial and some other market segments that we build internally as compared to where to we build externally.  David Wu [TC Research] The other thing I was wondering is in terms of OpEx I assume that this is, next fiscal year will be one of the years where we can have a three or four [weeks] difference between revenue growth and expense growth, if revenue growth will be up double-digit, low single-digit. If we have double-digit revenue growth for your business next fiscal year, should I think about your OpEx as up only low single-digit to support a double-digit top line growth.  Jerald Fishman  Well give you a little more sense of that when we put our plan together, but certainly as David and I are thinking about this thing were thinking of serious constraints on the OpEx next year independent of the revenues. So well give you a little more guidance on that when we close the plans. Were a little loathe to make a statement on that before we have a plan behind it but I can just give you what in my and David said, as we start putting together the objectives for the company for next year.  David Wu [TC Research] Tax rate will be about 20% next year also roughly.  David Zinsner  Yes, in that range.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs My question was on lead times you had alluded I think during the call that the goal is not to have lead times stretch out, I was just curious if you have seen any change in your lead times yet.  Jerald Fishman  Not really, a couple of little things here and there but no, Id say our lead times have been about what they were last quarter. Theyre very short.  Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs More on the administrative side, in terms of your interest and other expense you talked about it being an expense in Q4, how should we think about it in fiscal 2010. Do you expect to start generating interest income as we head into next year.  Jerald Fishman  Can you tell us what the interest rates are going to be? We got a lot of net cash. So the way to think about it is it really depends on we have that money very conservatively invested. Thats the bad news. The good news is we havent lost any of it which is the real goal and so I think it really depends on interest rates. If short-term rates or secure rates begin to move up, well do better.  If they stay at approximately zero probably not.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird Based on your order visibility do you expect the October quarter to be front end loaded or back end loaded from a shipment standpoint.  Jerald Fishman  I think it will be about linear, most of our quarters are, and theres no reason to think this quarter will be much different then that. The backlog is good starting out. The first couple of weeks in August looked pretty good so I would expect it will be relatively linear.  Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird And then regarding your utilization rates and I understand that youre still ramping capacity this quarter, its less then the end demand as you reduce slightly inventories, but were still a little bit less than 50%, end demand is picking up now but lets assume that there is weakness again next year, what room do you have for additional potential cuts in output versus what youve done so far in terms of consolidation.  Jerald Fishman  I think theres always new things that I dont want to speculate on hypotheticals here, but I think what weve demonstrated is that when the revenues went down 20%, 25% we dropped the OpEx by similar amounts and I think were sort of committed to those kind of things so well respond if we have to in a way thats responsible just like we did in this cycle. And as I look at it and see what weve been able to do during this cycle in terms of getting the costs down, I think we did a pretty good job of that and people in the company did a pretty good job of that.  And I think we did a better job then historically weve been known to do as the cycles have gone down. So I think well have to wait and see how that turns out.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely - JPMorgan Christopher Danely - JPMorgan Can you just give us your sense on how you see the end markets progressing going forward here. Do you think that were done with the inventory restocking and consumer and now were going to start in industrial, or just how you expect the recovery to play out now that weve bottomed.  Jerald Fishman  I think theres still more restocking to go on in the industrial business because I think we commented on this last time that our sales into the industrial market were down 30 some odd percent and our customers business wasnt down 30 some odd percent. So I think that theres probably some more to go in the industrial business and it seems like in the consumer business the inventory levels were okay and now in the communication infrastructure business the inventory levels seem to be okay.  I think in the industrial market of course the recovery has lagged those markets a little bit so were hoping that continues and we can get back to more rational levels of production for the industrial customers over the next couple of quarters. But well have to wait and see how that really turns out.  Christopher Danely - JPMorgan And so I guess you think that industrial wont be sort of this one quarter of pop, it will be more spread out over the next couple of quarters.  Jerald Fishman  Thats my belief because the, were still operating at numbers that are well, well, well below where we were four quarters ago. And were enthusiastic that weve seen the beginnings of a recovery but we havent seen a lot of it yet and our hope is that continues for the next couple of quarters but I think it will be more gradual then say the recovery in consumer or automotive, yes.  Thats what I believe. Christopher Danely - JPMorgan When you talk to the distributors how is there behavior these days. Are they ready to start restocking a little bit of certain products yet or do you still see them looking to take down inventory. Jerald Fishman  No, I think this was the first quarter if Im correct about this, correct me if Im wrong, where distributor inventory didnt go down.  David Zinsner   It was down just a hair. Jerald Fishman  Just a little bit, gone down quite a bit before, and so I think at the margin they seem to be as much concerned that theyre going to miss the next cycle on the upside as theyre going to wind up with too much inventory on the down side. So I think distributor are going to demonstrate the usual patterns of they want to be on the right of the cycle and I sense that theyre trying to get on the right side of the cycle being that they expect some growth coming up in the next couple of quarters.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen - Citigroup Terence Whalen - Citigroup I think a lot of the blocking and tackling has already been done, if I could revisit the topic of gross margin not with regard to the October quarter but to the January quarter, it sounds like we could get an increase in utilization as sort of maybe consumer begins to pull back in the January quarter and as industrial begins to build in the first half if Im to think about the levers between utilization and mix and I know they are correlated, which is going to be the dominant driver to drive gross margin and I think it might have been Jerald, you had said we could get it up a couple of points and I think David you earlier said its going to increase at a faster rate then the 90 bps in October, can you just put those together and help me understand that a little bit better.  David Zinsner  I think its tough to say, I mean really theyre almost so correlated together. When industrial mix improves it also improves our utilization which thus improves our gross margin so industrial is a pretty big component of our gross margin and I think Jerald is right in that I dont know that seasonality is a really big component but if you believe that were in the beginning of a recovery in industrial and industrial starts to improve again in the first quarter then well clearly see gross margin improvement in the first quarter. Jerald Fishman  Plus we have some tailwinds in some of the restructuring things that David talked about which ought to start to appear some time in first or second quarter so were more optimistic about the gross margin then weve been in a while because some of these improvements were already dialed in and theyre going to happen unless the world falls off the cliff completely and others are going to be dependent on the mix and the industrial business, better utilization but others are going, these are serious cost reductions and serious consolidations that weve done and the capital spending, when youre spending what were spending now eventually it starts matching depreciation. So I dont know, we have a lot of tailwinds on this thing and I dont think we have many headwinds on the gross margin because I think the mix is going to revert back to the historical mix of the company. Theres no reason to believe it going to get lopsided towards consumer or automotive which carries somewhat lower gross margin.  So I think when you add it all up, the 10,000 products and 100,000 customers we sell to we think the mix is going to be about the same when its all said and done.  Terence Whalen - Citigroup Related to that, can you talk a little bit about the consumer business, its not a business I have great visibility into. I typically think of things like digital still cameras, and things like home audio and video can you just revisit that segment again and is that a segment that would decline just naturally with seasonality in January or would that be April. Jerald Fishman  Yes, typically what happens is in the consumer business customers order up which is why our fourth quarter is usually reasonably good consumer quarter before the holidays and then all of a sudden it comes the first quarter and they realized either they sold not enough or too many and make adjustments. Then the Chinese New Year comes in February and so Id say our fourth quarter is probably going to be our peak consumer quarter as a percentage of revenues.  At least thats our planning assumption going forward.  Terence Whalen - Citigroup And then granularity on the revenues, if you could help us with that a little bit just to get a feel for what applications are really driving growth there.  Jerald Fishman  Well certainly for many years weve had a very strong position in the camera business, weve developed strong positions in segments of the high definition TV business, not so much related to the signal processing, the big digital processors which we dont do, but a lot of the peripheral functions that are in TVs, HDMI and other things.  We have a MEMS business which has a consumer content of it. Were starting to build microphones for consumer products and those look like theyre going to be very successful products. We have a lot of audio, very high end audio products into the consumer mix so what we try to do in the consumer business is focus on the application where what we do really changes the sight, the sound or the experience and not spend much resources focusing on things that rapidly commoditize and therefore have impaired gross margin forever. We have a lot of rules we are putting in place in analog about what kind of consumer applications were after and our sense increasingly is the way you see the quality of the technology in consumer products is, you look at the gross margin and if people arent willing to pay anything for it it may be great stuff, but its not worth much. So if it makes a big difference to the customer, if they can get more money for it in their end product, then those are good applications and if theyre not, theyre not very useful for us.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wong - Wells Fargo  David Wong - Wells Fargo  You mentioned just now that you were somewhat less interested in the computer end market can you tell us what segments both in terms of product type converters or so on or the end market you are particularly interested in in channeling your R&amp;D dollars. Jerald Fishman  Well certainly the industrial market has been a goldmine for analog for many years. Its highly fragmented. Theres thousands and thousands of customers lifecycles are long, the margins are high, its sort of like a perfect business school example of a great business to be in. We have a brand that sells the products, customers call us first, thats a great business and if we let the R&amp;D drift away from that business wed be total fools in my opinion.  The communication segments of the communications business have been very, very good businesses for us. The base station business certainly many other parts of communication infrastructure have been good businesses for us. Even though weve withdrawn from the base band processor in the handsets, many of the smart phones and other things have a lot of good analog functionality attached to them.  Youve probably seen it if you use those phones. We get paid for that functionality in the higher end phones. And of course many high end consumer products are very, theyre bundles of signal processing technology that impact sound, what you hear and so on. So I think we looked at the computer market a year or two ago and said, the rate of commoditization is high, we sold the business that was building power management products for PCs. We just didnt see where the value of that was for analog devices and we just look inside a personal computer today and we just dont see a lot of functions where our products can really make a consumer buy a particular PC or not and our experience is if you cant say that then its not very valuable business for us.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein I had a question on the industrial and auto so you said that I know auto was up tremendously in the quarter, you said it was driven in part by a strength in Europe, I note that though Europe itself was still flat, North America was down, is it fair to say that industrial was all in the US and Europe was actually down in the quarter.  Jerald Fishman  I dont think so, I think they were about flat. So there were obviously some other things there. The automotive business in Europe isnt all that large that it carries a huge amount of weight on the revenues so our automotive sales are 7% or 8% of our total sales and so I dont think those numbers are determinant to the total right now.  Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein And it sounds like recently youre hearing more positive feedback in the industrial is coming out of Asia are you hearing anything positive at all coming out of North America and Europe because I would assume that the bulk of your industrial sales are still in the US and in Europe. Jerald Fishman  Yes they are. And thats changing but its going to take awhile for them for equal whats going on in the US and Europe given the position that we have. I think as weve talked to US and European customers theyre at the margin more optimistic, theyre cautious. I think their optimism is more from what I heard personally more related to 2010 then 2009, at least our 2010 which begins in November. So I think that business is going to come back. The US industrial world is under pressure but its not under the kind of pressure that weve seen in our orders from industrial customers. The US isnt completely dead yet although well have to see how all the policies and practices that people are talking about actually impacts US industrial companies but I think at the margin you hear from most of the customers and you guys listen to the reports of those customers, at the margin theyre a little bit more optimistic.  And I think weve seen these cycles before and this one certainly is a lot worse then others but these things come back and it takes a while and the industrial market always comes back a little slower then some of the more faster moving markets like handsets and PCs and so on, but its going to come back, its just going to come back more gradually then other markets.  Stacy Rasgon Sanford Bernstein On the strength that youre seeing in industrial in Asia how much do you think of that is being driven by a government stimulus spending and how sustainable do you think it actually is Jerald Fishman  I think some of it clearly is, but our industrial sales in China were growing at a pretty good clip before anyone decided to put more money into it. Thats a franchise that if it was just stimulus we wouldnt see much because the design cycles of some of those products can be two or three years so our sense is yes, thats helping at the margin a little bit.  But its a base of business that weve been building for the last two or three years well before stimulus became fashionable.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML Just a question on your utilization rates, are you actually taking a period charge given the low levels of utilization and does that persist and if you could quantify that charge if there is one.   David Zinsner   Were certainly under absorbing our expenses within our manufacturing.  Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML I guess the question was but are you expensing that as a period charge in the same quarter as opposed to the impact of the under absorption flowing through the David Zinsner  No, all this kind of works its way through inventory.  Sumit Dhanda - Banc of America Securities - ML Any more thoughts on the convert which occurred I guess during the course of the July quarter, meaning in terms of strategically whats the thought process behind it.  Jerald Fishman  We did a straight debt financing for $375 million and thats a five year fixed note. We wound up swapping it for floating rate given all the cash we have so if interest rates go up we have plenty of cash, we have plenty of interest were going to get on the other side. The thought with that was actually very simple, it was that a large part of our cash balance are offshore. We dont really want to bring it back right now.  And we were relatively committed to the US dividend so we just wanted to build a little more cushion in to whatever happens that we dont have to think about that and that was why we did it. We wound up with an A credit, we wound up being able to borrow money at very low rates very quickly I would say.  And there was a lot of competition for those bonds which is why the pricing came out where it did. It was more of an insurance policy then anything else given that the world is a very uncertain place. And it became available and the rates looked good and the demand was very high.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Just to follow-up on the operating expense issue, you have done a very good job bringing down OpEx structurally and I know you dont want to give particular guidance for the first quarter of next year, or next year specifically, but as you look at the operating expense structure that you now have do you continue to see opportunity for structural improvement or with the work that youve done this year have you really exhausted the opportunities that you think exist in the model. Jerald Fishman  No I think theres more opportunities. I think where David and I have come out on this thing together is that we went into this cycle with the operating expenses too high in the company even at the revenue levels when they were $650 million a quarter. So weve been banging on this whole question pretty hard for the better part of a year and a half, two years. Some of that is getting out of businesses where the OpEx ratios were absurd relative to the returns.  Other parts of it were just tightening up a lot of things around the company. I think those, what were communicating around Analog is thats not a one time thing that you only do when business is bad, we believe we have a lot of OpEx leverage in this company that we can get with tenacity and we understand the implications of getting that leverage on what our stock is worth ultimately so were going to work hard to get that leverage. And weve done some things, theres more to do. Theres lots of different things we can to do tighten up the expense structure of the company. We continuously look at businesses more critically for those that are either because the competition has changed, the market structure has changed, some cases we didnt get the products out in time, products arent any good, to look at these businesses very often and say is this still meeting our strategic content or the intent for getting into those businesses to begin with.  Theres lots of ways to tighten up the R&amp;D process in the company, selling process, the administrative processes in the company, and were continuously working on all of those. We havent called the dogs off yet and I dont expect we will next year either.  Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Yes, keep the dogs going at it.  Jerald Fishman  Weve got a lot of big dogs barking at us on the operating expenses.  Craig Ellis - Caris &amp; Company Relatedly when you shut down the two fabs is there any incremental savings in the middle of the income statement or does it all flow into COGS. David Zinsner   Id say most of it falls into COGS. There is a little bit within the IT and R&amp;D function that does come out too, but its relatively small.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley The impact, when you shut down a factory is the impact to gross margin purely a function of the cost savings that you discussed or are there puts and takes incrementally either positive or negative associated with ramping production of new products at the new factory, either improving yields or yield hiccups as youre ramping the new product. Jerald Fishman  Our experience has been when you start ramping down a fab and ramping it up at a location as you wind up with cost increases in the interim because the yield, people stop focusing on it, these arent large numbers but I think at the margin it costs you a little bit of margin while youre doing it, but once you do it and youre done, and you got a group of people that are now focused on yield improvement on those products in the location where the products are actually going to be built, you see a very rapid turnaround.  At least thats been our experience in doing these things before.  Mark Lipacis - Morgan Stanley  With the inventory days coming down I have to believe that the effective lead times nudged up a little bit and the question for you is in your experience is extending lead times translate to double ordering on a linear basis, for example if the lead times go up theres more propensity for customers distributors to double order or is it more like a step function, say you hit lead times of 10, 12, 14, 16 weeks or something like that and then at some magical threshold you get a step function and double ordering.  Jerald Fishman  I think it winds up being more of a step function then you think because its not based on the lead time for this product went from four weeks to five weeks or three weeks to four weeks. Its based on a general fear that develops in the industry when they hear of shortages and that fear in the internet age usually you see within a period of one or two months.  Certainly we saw the inverse fear when the world collapsed on us that within a very, very short period of time, everybody panicked and stopped ordering everything and so I think there are trigger points on that. It doesnt happen every place at the same time but the response to the markets to perceive shortages is usually quite rapid in my experience.  But I dont think were seeing that. At least for our type of products I dont think any of our competitors that really stretched out the lead times, I dont think theres any, I dont get any calls from customers worrying about this or so, I think at the margin lead times are under pretty good control. At least at this point.  Operator There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments.
